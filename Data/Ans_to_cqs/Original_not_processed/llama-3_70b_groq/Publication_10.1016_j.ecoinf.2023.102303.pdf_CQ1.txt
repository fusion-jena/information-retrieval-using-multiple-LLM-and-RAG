Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters, the creation of a weakly labeled dataset, and the evaluation of the proposed models.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study, FishInTurbidWater, is a collection of underwater fish videos in turbid waters. The context does not provide information on how these videos were collected, but it is possible that they were obtained through underwater cameras or sensors.

In general, data collection methods for deep learning pipelines can vary widely depending on the application and domain. Surveys, sensors, and public datasets are all potential sources of raw data, but the specific method used in this study is not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
