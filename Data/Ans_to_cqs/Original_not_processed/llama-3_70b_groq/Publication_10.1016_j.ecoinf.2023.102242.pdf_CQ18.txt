Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing classification methods, data processing, and object-oriented classification, but it does not provide information about the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.

The context does provide some metrics, such as accuracy percentages and Kappa values, which suggest that the model's performance is being evaluated, but it does not explain how this evaluation is being done during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
