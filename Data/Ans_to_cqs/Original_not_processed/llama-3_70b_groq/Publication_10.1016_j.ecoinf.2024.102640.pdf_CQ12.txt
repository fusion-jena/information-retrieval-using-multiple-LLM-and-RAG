Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer-based model, specifically a SegFormer model, which is a state-of-the-art model for semantic segmentation. The SegFormer model follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder is a hierarchically transformer structure (MiT) and the decoder is a lightweight decoder composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.
