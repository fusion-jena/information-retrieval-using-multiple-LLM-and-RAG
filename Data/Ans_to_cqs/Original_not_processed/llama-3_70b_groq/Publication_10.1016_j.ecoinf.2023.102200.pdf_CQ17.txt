Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and other machine learning techniques in remote sensing, ecology, and related fields, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline implementation or regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
