Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved. 

In section 2.3.5, the context mentions that "To assess the model's performance, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used." This implies that after the model training, the performance of the model is evaluated using these metrics.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used in explainability techniques, such as SHAP values, which are mentioned in the context, but it is not clear if they are used as a postprocessing step after model training. 

Therefore, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed based on the provided context is metrics calculation.
