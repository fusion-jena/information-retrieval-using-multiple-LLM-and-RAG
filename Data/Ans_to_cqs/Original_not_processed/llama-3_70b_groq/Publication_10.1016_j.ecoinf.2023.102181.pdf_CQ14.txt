Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model is run with default hyperparameters, which are specified as number of trees (ntree) = 500, minimum number of observations in a terminal node (nodesize) = 5, and number of variables tried at each split (mtry) = ⌊Nβ⌋ = 1, where Nβ = 5 is the number of predictors. There is no indication of grid search, random search, or any other optimization method being used to tune these hyperparameters.
