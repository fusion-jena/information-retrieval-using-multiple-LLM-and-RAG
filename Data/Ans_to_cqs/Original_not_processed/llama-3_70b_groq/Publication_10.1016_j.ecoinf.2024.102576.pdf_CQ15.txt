Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the application of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. It also mentions the importance of labeling data for training deep learning models, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
