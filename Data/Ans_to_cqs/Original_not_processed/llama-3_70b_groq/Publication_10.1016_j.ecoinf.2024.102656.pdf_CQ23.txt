Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The models mentioned are GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, which are traditional machine learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does mention that the ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging approach, assigning weights to individual models based on their predictive accuracy on the test data. This suggests that some form of model evaluation and selection was performed, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of metrics such as AUC and TSS to evaluate the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset.
