Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The context mentions that the initial version of the BA algorithm implemented in FIREMAP involves a supervised ML classification to procure a BA vector of the region of interest defined by the user. This suggests that the deep learning model is used for classification, specifically to classify the region of interest into different categories based on the BA vector. The model is trained on a large predefined dataset and uses atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 post-fire Level-2A scenes to minimize commission errors associated with land cover changes. The results of the classification are visualized as a categorized BA map, which can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in ESRI shapefile format.
