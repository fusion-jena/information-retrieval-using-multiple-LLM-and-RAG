Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery and historical imagery with variable characteristics (e.g., blurriness, distortion). It also mentions the potential use of online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products with more detailed spectral information and coarser spatial detail.

It can be inferred that the raw data collection methods might involve remote sensing technologies, such as aerial or satellite imagery, which provide the input data for the machine learning tools. However, the context does not provide specific information on whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
