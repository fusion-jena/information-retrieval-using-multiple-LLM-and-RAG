Answer::: 
The purpose of the deep learning models in this study is classification and object detection. The classification task involves identifying whether an image contains Cortaderia selloana or not, whereas the object detection task involves locating the target object (Cortaderia selloana) within the image. The study uses various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0 for the classification task, and Faster R-CNN ResNet50 for the object detection task.
