Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention model validation, which is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. According to the context, the model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) Curve (AUC), which is a common metric for assessing the performance of species probability distribution models. 

There is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
