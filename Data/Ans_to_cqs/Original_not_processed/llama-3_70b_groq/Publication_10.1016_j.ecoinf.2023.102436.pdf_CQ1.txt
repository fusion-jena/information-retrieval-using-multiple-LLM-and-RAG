Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and landscape analysis, but it does not provide specific information about the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for landscape photograph analysis, oblique photogrammetry for 3D landscape index construction, and other methods for landscape analysis. However, it does not provide information about the raw data collection methods used in these approaches.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
