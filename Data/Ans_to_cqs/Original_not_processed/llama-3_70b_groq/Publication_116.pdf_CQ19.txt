Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, it does mention Caffe in reference [34], which suggests that Caffe might be one of the frameworks used. However, it is not explicitly stated that Caffe is used to build the model in question. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
