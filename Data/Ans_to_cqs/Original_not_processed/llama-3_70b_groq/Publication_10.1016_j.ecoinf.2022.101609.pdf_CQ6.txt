Answer:::

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Categorify: This step maps categorical columns to distinct categories.
2. FillMissing: This step replaces null values with column median values.
3. Normalize: This step normalizes continuous columns by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Additionally, the "add datepart" helper function is used to specify the date column, which generates additional predictors such as "Year", "DayofWeek", "DayOfYear", "Is Month_End", and so on.

These preprocessing steps are performed using the Fastai library, which is built on the PyTorch framework. The goal of these steps is to prepare the data for efficient training of the deep learning model.
