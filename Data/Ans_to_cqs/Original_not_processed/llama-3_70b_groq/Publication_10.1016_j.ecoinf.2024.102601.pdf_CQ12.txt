Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which is a type of traditional machine learning model, not a deep learning model. The hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, which are methods provided by the scikit-learn library, but they are not specific to deep learning models. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as there is no mention of deep learning models being used.
