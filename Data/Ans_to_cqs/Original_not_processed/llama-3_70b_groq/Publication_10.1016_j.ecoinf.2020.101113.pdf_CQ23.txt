Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model training, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across 1000 classes. This might have helped the model learn generalizable image features that can be fine-tuned for spectrogram classification. 

Additionally, the use of a single ResNet50 model instead of an ensemble of multiple models might have been a compromise between prediction efficiency and reasonable memory requirements, but it does not provide direct evidence of measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
