Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the HRNet model, its application in semantic segmentation, and the calculation of various indicators using the model's output. It also mentions the use of NLP models and other techniques, but data augmentation techniques are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
