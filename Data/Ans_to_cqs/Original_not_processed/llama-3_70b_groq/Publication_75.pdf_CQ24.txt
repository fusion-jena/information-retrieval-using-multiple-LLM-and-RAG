Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text focuses on proposing a new CNN model, SeedNet, for single seed classification and retrieval, and discusses the experimental setup, results, and comparisons with other models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a specific input image size (224 × 224 × 3) and a Max pooling strategy with a 3 × 3 filter size and 1 × 1 stride, which may help reduce randomness in the model. Additionally, the use of a ReLU activation function and a N-way softmax output layer may also contribute to stabilizing the model's behavior.

But, regarding specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting random seed values, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
