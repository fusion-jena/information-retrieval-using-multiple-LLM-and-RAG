Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc. The context focuses on explaining the architecture of the neural network, including the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer, as well as the activation functions used. It also discusses the application of the model for land use and land cover classification, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
