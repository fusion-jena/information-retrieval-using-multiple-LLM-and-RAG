Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, specifically RGB images. This is evident from the data preparation step, where it is mentioned that RGB images must be resized to 224 Ã— 224 pixels and normalized (centered and scaled) to the training dataset (ImageNet). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
