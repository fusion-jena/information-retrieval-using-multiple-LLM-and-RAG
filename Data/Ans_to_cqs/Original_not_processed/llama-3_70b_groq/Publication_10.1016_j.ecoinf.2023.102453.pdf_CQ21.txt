Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that after a model has been trained, it needs to be validated and tested to confirm that it has achieved the desired performance, and the performance might be measured using different metrics, such as classification metrics. 

It can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, but the context does not provide information about other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to this query based on the provided context.
