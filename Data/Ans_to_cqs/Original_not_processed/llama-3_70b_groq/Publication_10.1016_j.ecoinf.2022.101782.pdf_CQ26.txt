Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of using multiple data sources to obtain more complete and less biased datasets. This suggests that the authors are aware of the potential issue of data bias and are taking steps to mitigate it, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flip, counter-clockwise shear, and random zoom, which can help to increase the diversity of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. However, these techniques are not specifically mentioned as a way to address data bias.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
