Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily consists of references to various studies and papers related to remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, with a focus on Antarctic research and the use of machine learning and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wildlife surveys and habitat analysis. While some papers mention the use of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they do not provide details on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
