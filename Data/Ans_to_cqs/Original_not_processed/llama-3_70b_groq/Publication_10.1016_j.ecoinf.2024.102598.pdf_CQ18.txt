Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation (CV). This involves reserving 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a validation set, with the remaining 70% of the data being used to train the model. This rigorous validation methodology was adopted following the method explained by Eskandari et al. (2021). The approach generated 50 resulting models, consisting of 10 models for each machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the performance of each model was assessed using several metrics, such as AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi, to evaluate the predictive capabilities of each model.
