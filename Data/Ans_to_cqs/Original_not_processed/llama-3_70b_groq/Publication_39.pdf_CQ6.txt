Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training process, optimization techniques, and model architectures used for action recognition and object detection tasks.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention data augmentation for action recognition, which implies that some form of preprocessing might be involved. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
