Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The context discusses the evaluation of datasets using F-UJI and the characteristics of various data repositories such as Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, and others. It does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
