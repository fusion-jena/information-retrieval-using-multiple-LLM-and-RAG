Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecology, and climate change, and mentions datasets such as WORLDCLIM, Digital Elevation Model, and distance-to-variables (e.g., distance-to-rivers, distance-to-roads). There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related datasets.
