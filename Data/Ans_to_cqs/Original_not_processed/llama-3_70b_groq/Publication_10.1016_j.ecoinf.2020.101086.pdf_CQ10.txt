Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs) and discusses the effects of sample size on the performance of SDMs, as well as issues with sampling bias and limited presence sites. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
