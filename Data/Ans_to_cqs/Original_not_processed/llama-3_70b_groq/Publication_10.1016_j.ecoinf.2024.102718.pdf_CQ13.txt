Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, and others. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the BEiT model and its variants, comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics with other state-of-the-art models. It also discusses the ablation study, sensitivity experiments, and the impact of image size on the model's performance. However, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
