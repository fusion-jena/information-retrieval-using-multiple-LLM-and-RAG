Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the machine learning workflow stages (Table 3), classifier training performance (Table 5), and the hardware used for the work. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the calculation of mean cross-validation (CV) and final training accuracy (Table 5), which could be considered as part of the postprocessing steps. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training.
