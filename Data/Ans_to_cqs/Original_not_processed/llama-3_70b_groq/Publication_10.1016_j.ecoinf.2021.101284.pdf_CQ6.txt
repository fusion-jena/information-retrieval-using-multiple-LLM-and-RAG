Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that standardization is one of the preprocessing steps involved before training a model. This is mentioned in the "Materials and methods" section, where it is stated that standardization was used to preprocess the data. Specifically, it is mentioned that standardization allows changing the scope of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range, while preserving the distance relations between individual data.

The formula for standardization is also provided, which is:

xnew_j,i = (xj,i - mi) / stdi

This suggests that the data is standardized by subtracting the mean (mi) and dividing by the standard deviation (stdi) for each feature.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or normalization are involved. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these steps are part of the preprocessing pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but rather refers to statistical models and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models. Therefore, it is unclear whether the preprocessing steps mentioned are specific to deep learning models or applicable to other types of models as well.
