Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the architectures used, such as VGG16, ResNet50, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, but does not specify the framework used to implement these architectures. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
