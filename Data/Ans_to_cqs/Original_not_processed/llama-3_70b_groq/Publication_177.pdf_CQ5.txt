Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are UBD_45 and VP_200. These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of different deep neural network models, including InceptionResnet2, Resnet50, Xception, Inceptionv3, Mobilenetv2, and Googlenet. The datasets are used for plant species classification, and they contain images of different plant species. The UBD_45 dataset has a higher testing accuracy compared to the VP_200 dataset, with the highest testing accuracy of 96.7% achieved using the InceptionResNetV2 network.
