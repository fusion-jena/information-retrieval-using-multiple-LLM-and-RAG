Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of machine learning for vegetation studies, the types of models used, and the evaluation metrics. It also provides details on the hyperparameter tuning process using Optuna grid search and the computation of SHAP values to understand feature importance. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
