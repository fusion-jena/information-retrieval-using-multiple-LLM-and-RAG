Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the network can extract plant cover information without training on actual annotated plant cover data, implying that no explicit annotation is required. However, it does not provide information on the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
