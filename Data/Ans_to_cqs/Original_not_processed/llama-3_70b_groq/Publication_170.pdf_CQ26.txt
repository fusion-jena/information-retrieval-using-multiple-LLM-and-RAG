Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for image classification in wildlife surveys, specifically using camera trap images. It discusses the use of AlexNet model, different training modes, and computing platforms, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
