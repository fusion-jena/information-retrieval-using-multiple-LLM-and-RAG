Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to a mathematical model for simulating the spread of wildfires or pest plants, and it discusses the model's parameters, limitations, and application to a real-world scenario. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
