Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used for training a Siamese network using few-shot learning and the evaluation of animal tracking. It discusses the N-way K-shot problem, two-way one-shot learning, and the refinement module used to suppress false-positive detections and filter background interference. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
