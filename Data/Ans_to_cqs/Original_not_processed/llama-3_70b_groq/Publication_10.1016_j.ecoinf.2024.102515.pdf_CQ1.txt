Answer: Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through Twitter's Full-archive search endpoint, which provides access to the entire dataset published on Twitter from its beginning in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. The Twitter API is used to search for specific keywords, hashtags, or combinations of both in the text of tweets. The twarc2 library is employed to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API, simplifying the handling of quota limits and pagination resulting from a single query.
