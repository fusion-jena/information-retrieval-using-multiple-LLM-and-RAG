Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the Wind2TSM model, which utilizes five machine learning methodologies: linear regression, regression trees, support vector machines, Gaussian process regression, and neural networks. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
