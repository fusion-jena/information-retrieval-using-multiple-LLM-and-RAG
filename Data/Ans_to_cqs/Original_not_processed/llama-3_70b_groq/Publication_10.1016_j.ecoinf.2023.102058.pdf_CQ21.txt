Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. It discusses the use of different machine learning approaches, such as principal component regression, partial least square regression, and random forest, to establish links between the simulated image spectra and water quality attributes. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
