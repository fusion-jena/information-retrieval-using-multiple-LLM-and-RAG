Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Learning rate: 0.01 (fixed)
* Optimizer: Stochastic gradient descent algorithm
* Batch size: 10
* Number of epochs: 300
* Number of units in the two fully connected (FC) layers: 512 and 256, respectively
* Dropout rate: Not specified (determined by five-fold cross-validation)

These hyperparameters are mentioned in the context as part of the description of the CNN model used for within-dataset classification.
