Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation on the test data set. It discusses the model's performance in terms of RMSE and MAE, and provides a comparison with another model (Model-K). However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
