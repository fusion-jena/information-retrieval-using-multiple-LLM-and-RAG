Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, hyperparameters, and infrastructure used for training neural networks for fish segmentation and classification tasks. 

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have been performed during the "Preprocessing of historical images" module (purple, sec. 2.1) mentioned in Fig. 1. Unfortunately, the details of this module are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, as this information is not provided in the given context.
