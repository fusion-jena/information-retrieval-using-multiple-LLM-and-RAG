Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the mini-batch size, its impact on the learning process, and the limitations imposed by the available GPU memory. It also touches on the challenges of using deep learning and the importance of reviewing published studies to set training options. However, it does not provide information on how to split the data for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
