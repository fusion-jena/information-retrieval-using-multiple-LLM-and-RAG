Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecology, geography, and remote sensing, with references to papers and datasets related to these fields. While some of the papers may use deep learning techniques, the context does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
