Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions various architectures and techniques such as CNN, ViT, ResNet, YOLOv7, and CAM, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It could be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework.
