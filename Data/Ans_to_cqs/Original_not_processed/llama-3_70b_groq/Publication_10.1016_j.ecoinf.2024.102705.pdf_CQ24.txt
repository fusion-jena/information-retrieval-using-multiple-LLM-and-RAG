Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the concept of deep learning, its applications, and various techniques used in different domains.

However, it is common knowledge in the field of deep learning that randomness can be handled through various strategies, such as:

1. Fixing the random seed: This involves setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques can help reduce the impact of randomness in the model.
3. Ensemble methods: Averaging the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds can help reduce the effect of randomness.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Carefully tuning hyperparameters can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

It is essential to note that these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and I am drawing from general knowledge in the field of deep learning.
