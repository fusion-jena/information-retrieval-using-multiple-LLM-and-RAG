Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on different neural network architectures, their design, and training parameters, as well as their applications in computer vision tasks. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
