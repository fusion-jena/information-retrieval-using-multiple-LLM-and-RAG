Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a GoogLeNet architecture, which was the winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition. This implies that the authors might have used a subset of the ImageNet dataset or a similar dataset for their experiment. Additionally, the authors mention that they used a dataset of 20 fish species, with at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class, which was used to train and test their network.
