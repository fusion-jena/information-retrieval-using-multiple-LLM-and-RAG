Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and hyperparameters of various deep learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, as well as their performance metrics. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are typically used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
