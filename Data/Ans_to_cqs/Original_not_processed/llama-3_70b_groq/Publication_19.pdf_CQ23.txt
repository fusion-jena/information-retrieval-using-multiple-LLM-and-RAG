Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning, model performance, and model size reduction using TensorFlow Lite. It does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure model generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
