Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that "the availability of the source code facilitates customization for monitoring additional pollutants, while shared air quality datasets ensure reproducibility." This implies that the source code is available, but it does not provide information about where it can be found. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
