Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various deep learning models and techniques, including EfficientNet, MobileNet, and YOLOv7, but it does not provide information about the datasets used to train or evaluate these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
