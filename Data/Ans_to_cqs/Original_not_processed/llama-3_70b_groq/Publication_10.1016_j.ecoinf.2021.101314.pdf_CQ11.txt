Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses redescriptions, queries, and accuracy gains, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The only link mentioned is http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html, which seems to be a link to a GIS data repository, but it is not clear if it is related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
