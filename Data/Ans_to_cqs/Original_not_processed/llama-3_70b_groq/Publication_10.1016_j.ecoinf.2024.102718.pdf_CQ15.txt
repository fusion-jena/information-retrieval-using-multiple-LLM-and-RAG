Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the performance of the BEiT model, its architecture, and its application in agricultural settings, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
