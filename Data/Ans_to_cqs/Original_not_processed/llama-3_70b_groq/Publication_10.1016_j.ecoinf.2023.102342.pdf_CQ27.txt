Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and data processing techniques, but it does not provide information about deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
