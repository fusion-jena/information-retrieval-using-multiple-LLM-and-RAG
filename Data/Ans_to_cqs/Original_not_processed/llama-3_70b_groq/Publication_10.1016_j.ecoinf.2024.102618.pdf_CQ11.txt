Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models and architectures used for plant disease classification, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
