Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks, for plant species identification and plant cover information extraction. It discusses the network setup, architecture, and parameters used for the investigation but does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the data might be collected through image analysis, as mentioned in Blaschke (2010) and Bauer and Strauss (2014). The use of image analysis suggests that the raw data might be collected through remote sensing or camera-based systems. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to increase the network output resolution, which further supports the idea that image data might be involved.

However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
