Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, image capture, and metadata, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. However, I can suggest that the techniques you mentioned, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines.
