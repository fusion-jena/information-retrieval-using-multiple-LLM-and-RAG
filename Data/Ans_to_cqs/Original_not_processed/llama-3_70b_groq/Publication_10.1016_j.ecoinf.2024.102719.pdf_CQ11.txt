Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references and a brief discussion on predictive models for river health, but it does not provide information on a specific data repository link. The "Data availability" section only mentions that "Data will be made available on request," but it does not provide a link to a repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
