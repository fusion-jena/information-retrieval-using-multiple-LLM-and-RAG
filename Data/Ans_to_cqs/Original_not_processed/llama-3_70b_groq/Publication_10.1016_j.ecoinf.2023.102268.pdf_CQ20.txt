Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and its application to spectrogram images, as well as the classification model and its evaluation. However, it does not provide information about the computational resources or hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training.
