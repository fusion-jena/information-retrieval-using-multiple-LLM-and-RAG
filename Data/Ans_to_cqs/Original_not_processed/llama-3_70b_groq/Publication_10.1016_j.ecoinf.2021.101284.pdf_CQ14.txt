Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of standardization for preprocessing the data, presents the results of different models (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5), and shows the W* parameters values for each model, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used for the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
