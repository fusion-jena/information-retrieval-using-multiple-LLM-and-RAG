Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on land type conversion drivers, land-use dynamics, and various models like PLUS, LSTM, and MOP. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline management or randomness handling.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random forest (RFC) in the PLUS model, which might involve random seed values. But the context does not provide further information on how randomness is handled in this case.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques like setting fixed random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, or employing ensemble methods to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
