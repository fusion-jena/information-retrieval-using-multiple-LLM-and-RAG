Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that are applied to the images before training the YOLO model.

According to the context, the data augmentation techniques used include:

* Horizontal flip
* Grayscale (applied to 25% of images)
* Blur (up to 10px)
* Noise (up to 10% of pixels)
* Cropping (randomly cropping a patch with the same size as the original image)

These techniques are used to extend the amount of information in the dataset and act as a regularizer to reduce overfitting. However, it does not mention any other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
