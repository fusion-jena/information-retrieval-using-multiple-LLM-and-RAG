Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the optimization of data structures for machine learning classification, the use of XAI techniques, and the hyperparameter optimization task using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
