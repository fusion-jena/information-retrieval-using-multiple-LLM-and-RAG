Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "the tiles containing Pacific oysters were split into 70% training, and 30% validation" (Section 2.3. Validation and training datasets). This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria or method used for this split is not provided. There is no mention of a test set or how the data was split for testing purposes.
