Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to statistical modeling and feature selection, with mentions of GLM, GAM, and Random Forest, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
