Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the processing and preparation of the data, including data reduction, data augmentation, and the impact of these methods on the classification accuracy of the deep learning model. It also discusses the imbalance in the training data due to the varying areas of different forest types and the actions taken to address this issue. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
