Answer: The framework used to build the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a version of the YOLO DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) is used, which is a type of object detection algorithm. The context also mentions that the YOLO DCNN uses pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. While TensorFlow is mentioned in the context, it is not explicitly stated that it is used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the specific framework used to build the model.
