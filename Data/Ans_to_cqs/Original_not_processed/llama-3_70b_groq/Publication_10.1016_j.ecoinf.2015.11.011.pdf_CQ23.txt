Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text discusses the use of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and eCognition for segmentation and classification, but it does not mention deep learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the context.
