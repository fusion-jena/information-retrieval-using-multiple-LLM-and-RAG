Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of semi-supervised and weakly-supervised models with fully-supervised models in turbid water scenarios and the description of the EfficientNet model. It also mentions the FishInTurbidWater dataset, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was prepared or split for training and evaluation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
