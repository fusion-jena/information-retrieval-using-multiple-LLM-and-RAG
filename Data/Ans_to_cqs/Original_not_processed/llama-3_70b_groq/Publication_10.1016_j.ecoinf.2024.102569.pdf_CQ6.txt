Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on a specific method for species distribution modeling, discussing topics such as the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE), penalized loss function, and L1 penalty. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the issue of heterogeneous observations and the need to remove their impact. This could imply that some form of data cleaning or preprocessing might be necessary, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

In general, preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important for training deep learning models, but the context does not provide specific information on these steps.
