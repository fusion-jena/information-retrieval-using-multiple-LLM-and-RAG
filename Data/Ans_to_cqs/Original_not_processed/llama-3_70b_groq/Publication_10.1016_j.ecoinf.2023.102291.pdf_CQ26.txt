Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of humpback whale songs and provides details on the architecture, training, and inference procedures. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
