Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the use of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and feature extraction, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
