Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses the process of resizing the photographs to a maximum width of 2500 pixels to reduce computing time and splitting each photograph into 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples. It does not provide information on any additional data augmentation techniques used to increase the diversity of the training data.
