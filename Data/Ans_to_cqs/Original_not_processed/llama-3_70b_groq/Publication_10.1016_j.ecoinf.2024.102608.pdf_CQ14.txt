Answer::: 

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a randomized grid search method. This approach is used instead of an exhaustive grid search, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters. The randomized grid search offers several advantages, including reducing computational cost and finding equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others.
