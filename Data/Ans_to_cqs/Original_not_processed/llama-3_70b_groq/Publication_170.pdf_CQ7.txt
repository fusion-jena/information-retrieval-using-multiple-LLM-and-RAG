Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions that the model performance evaluation used a test set (Test) to evaluate the performance of models in different training phases, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training and testing sets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
