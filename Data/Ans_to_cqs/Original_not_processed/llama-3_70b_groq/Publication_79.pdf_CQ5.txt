Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques in remote sensing and vegetation pattern recognition, citing various research papers and studies.

However, it does mention that deep learning networks learn features from the training data to identify the desired classes. It also references some datasets, such as Google Earth imagery, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 images, which are used for vegetation pattern recognition and tree crown delineation.

But, it does not provide information about the specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These datasets are typically used for image classification tasks, and their usage is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
