Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the architecture of the PTDLEN-VAE model, its components, and the process of training and validation. It mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation (BP) for training, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
