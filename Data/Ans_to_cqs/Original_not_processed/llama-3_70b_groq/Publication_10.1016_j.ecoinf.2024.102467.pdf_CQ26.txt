Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and articles, mostly related to deep learning, computer vision, and aquaculture. 

However, it is worth noting that some of the papers mentioned do discuss techniques related to data preprocessing, such as data augmentation, equalization, and feature fusion. For example, the paper "Underwater color image enhancement algorithm based on multi-channel equalization" might be related to preprocessing techniques for underwater images. 

But, unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
