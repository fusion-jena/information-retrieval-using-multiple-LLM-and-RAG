Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on comparing shallow learning (XGBoost) and deep learning (CNN) methods for large-scale spatial wetland classification, and it does not delve into data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this particular study. However, I can suggest that common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as mentioned in the query. These techniques can help mitigate bias in the dataset and improve the performance of machine learning models.
