Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the challenges of semantic segmentation with few images and high class-imbalance, and the use of data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size. However, it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
