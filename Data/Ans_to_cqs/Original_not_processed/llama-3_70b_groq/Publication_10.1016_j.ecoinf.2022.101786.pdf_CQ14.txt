Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Some model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance use of resources and training speed" and that "Other parameters were kept to default or set according to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)". 

There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized based on the provided context.
