Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models, ecological modeling, and Bayesian methods. 

The only mention of regularization is in the Friedman et al. (2010) paper, which discusses regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent. However, this is not related to deep learning or the specific regularization methods mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
