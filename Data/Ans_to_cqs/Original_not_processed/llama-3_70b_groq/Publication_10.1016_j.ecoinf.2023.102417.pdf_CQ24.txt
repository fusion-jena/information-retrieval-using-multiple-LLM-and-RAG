Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in biomonitoring, specifically in image classification and semantic segmentation for biocrust coverage estimation. It discusses the importance of training models on datasets that resemble the data they will be applied to, the concept of data drift, and the need for domain adaptation. Additionally, it touches on the use of manual image annotation, established image datasets, and neural network architectures for semantic image segmentation. However, it does not address the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
