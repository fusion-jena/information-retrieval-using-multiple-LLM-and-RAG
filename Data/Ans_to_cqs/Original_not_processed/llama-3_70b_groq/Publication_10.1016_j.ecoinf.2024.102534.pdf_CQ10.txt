Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to orchids, ecology, and environmental science, with references to various research papers and datasets. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
