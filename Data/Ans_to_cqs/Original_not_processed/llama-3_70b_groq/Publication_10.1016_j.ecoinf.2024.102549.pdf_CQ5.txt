Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in environmental studies, particularly in water quality monitoring and image scene classification tasks. It discusses the architecture of AlexNet, a type of CNN, and its effectiveness in handling small-sized inputs and complex problems. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
