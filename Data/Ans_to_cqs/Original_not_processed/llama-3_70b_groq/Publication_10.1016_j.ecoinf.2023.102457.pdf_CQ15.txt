Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained CNNs, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for feature extraction and classification of acoustic signals. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process of these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
