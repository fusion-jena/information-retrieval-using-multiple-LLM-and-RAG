Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the ERNIE model and its performance in previous studies, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Additionally, the context explains the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, but it does not mention hyperparameters either. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
