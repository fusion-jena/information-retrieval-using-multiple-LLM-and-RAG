Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets." However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
