Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that introducing the hybrid model (CNN-LSTM) improves the model's prediction accuracy without any adjustments to the hyperparameters. This implies that the hyperparameters were not changed, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, I don't know the exact hyperparameters used in the model.
