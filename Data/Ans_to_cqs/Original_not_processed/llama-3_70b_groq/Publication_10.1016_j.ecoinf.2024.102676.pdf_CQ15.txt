Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily discusses missing value imputation methods, including missForest, and their application to Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) for species identification. It also mentions the use of deep learning models in a study to classify otter species, but it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used in that study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
