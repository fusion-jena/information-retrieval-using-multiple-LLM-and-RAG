Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the VnPollenBee dataset, which is used for bee image classification. Additionally, it is mentioned that some pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were used, which were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. However, it is not clear if ImageNet was used as a dataset in the pipeline or just as a pre-training dataset for the DNNs. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the pipeline.
