Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data model, vocabularies, image library, process flow, and FAIR data principles in the context of fish scale and otolith analysis. It mentions that scale and otolith images are used for age and growth estimations, and these images are stored in a collaborative online space with file names matching the unique archive sample ID in the IFBA database. However, it does not provide information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
