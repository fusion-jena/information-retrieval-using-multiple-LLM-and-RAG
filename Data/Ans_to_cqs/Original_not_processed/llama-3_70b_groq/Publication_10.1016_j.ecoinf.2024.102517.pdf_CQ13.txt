Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014)
* Learning rate: 10^-4

These hyperparameters are mentioned in Section 2.3.3. Experimental setting, where it is stated that "the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4."
