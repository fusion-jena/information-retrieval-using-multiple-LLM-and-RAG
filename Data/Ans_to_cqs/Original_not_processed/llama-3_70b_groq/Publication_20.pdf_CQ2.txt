Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The text mentions "images annotated by experts for all classes to identify" and "thumbnails" of fish, indicating that the input data is visual in nature. Additionally, the use of a GoogLeNet architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks, further supports this conclusion. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
