Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the structure and functionality of Neural Networks (NN), the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 and 4 (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) for language quality enhancement, and the implementation of K-fold cross-validation technique for model validation. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the application of random under sampling (RUS) to address imbalances in the training set during the validation phase. This suggests that some form of preprocessing or data manipulation is being performed, but the specific steps involved are not elaborated upon.

In general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature selection, and data augmentation, among others. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular context.
