Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of deep learning for assessing and segmenting salt-affected soils, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The article provides details on the experimental design, training process, and loss function used, but it does not include a link to the actual code implementation.
