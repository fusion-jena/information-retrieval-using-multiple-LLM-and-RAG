Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and data processing techniques, but it does not provide information about the use of deep learning models in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
