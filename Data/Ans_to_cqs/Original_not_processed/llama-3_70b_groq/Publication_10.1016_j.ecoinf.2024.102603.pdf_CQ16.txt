Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the XGBoost model, its functionality, and the evaluation metrics used to assess its performance. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance metrics, or a predetermined number of iterations to determine when training is complete. But, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular case.

In summary, the answer to this query is unknown based on the provided context.
