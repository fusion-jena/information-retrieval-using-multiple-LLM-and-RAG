Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically forest species classification. The model is designed to classify hyperspectral images (HSI) captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) into different forest species classes. The classification task involves assigning a class label to each pixel in the HSI based on its spectral features. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the HSI data and classify them into different forest species.
