Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions "more than 58,000 images taken by an AUV 1200 m deep in the North-East Atlantic" and "500 manually annotated images from the same transect" used for testing the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a YOLOV4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is typically used for image classification and object detection tasks. The predictions from the model are also stored in a .JSON file containing the coordinates of the bounding box of each tentative annotation as well as a confidence score. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
