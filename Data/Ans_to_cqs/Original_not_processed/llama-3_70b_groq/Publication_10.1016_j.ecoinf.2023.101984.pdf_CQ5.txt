Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecology, biology, and environmental science, with references to papers on topics such as drought tolerance, ecological niche modeling, and ecoregions. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision, which are the typical domains where datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
