Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors employed 5-fold cross-validation over the dataset. This approach provides a robust and unbiased estimate of a model's performance while also guiding effective hyper-parameter tuning for improved overall performance. The dataset was divided into 5 subsets, and at each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation, one subset was used to evaluate the models using the performance metrics, while the remaining 4 subsets were used for training (90% of the images) and validation (10% of the images). This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizable to new, unseen data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
