Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context mentions two datasets: CS and NW. These datasets are used to train and test the machine learning models, specifically Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. The context does not provide further information about the nature or composition of these datasets.
