Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of YOLOv6, a deep learning model, for object detection, but it does not specify the datasets used for training or testing the model. 

The context mentions that the authors published the data used in the study, but it does not provide details about the datasets. It cites several research papers related to remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, but none of these papers seem to be directly related to the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
