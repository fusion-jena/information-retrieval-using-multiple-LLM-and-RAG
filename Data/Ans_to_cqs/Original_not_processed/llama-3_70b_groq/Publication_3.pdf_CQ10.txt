Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the research study, its methodology, and results, but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
