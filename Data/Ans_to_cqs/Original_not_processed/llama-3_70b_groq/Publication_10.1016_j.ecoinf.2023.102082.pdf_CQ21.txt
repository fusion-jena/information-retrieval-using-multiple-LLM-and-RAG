Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing the use of LiDAR GEDI data and machine learning models for forest ecosystem monitoring, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved in the model training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
