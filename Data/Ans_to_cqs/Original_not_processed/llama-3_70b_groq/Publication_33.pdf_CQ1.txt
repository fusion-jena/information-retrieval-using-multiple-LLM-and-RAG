Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through underwater high-definition videos. Specifically, the data was collected from 175 underwater high-definition videos recorded in the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) using GoPro Hero 3+ black and Hero 4+ black cameras. These videos were recorded between 2 and 30 meters deep, with a broad range of luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and barrier reefs. The videos lasted between 5 and 21 minutes, resulting in a total of 83 hours of footage. From these videos, fish images were extracted to create a dataset for training and testing the CNN model and post-processing method.
