Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and evaluating the performance of these models using metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI. There is no mention of deploying a trained deep learning model, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
