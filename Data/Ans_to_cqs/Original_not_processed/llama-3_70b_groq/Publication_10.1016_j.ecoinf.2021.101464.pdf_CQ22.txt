Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses a random forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning model, not a deep learning model. 

However, based on the context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the RF model are:

1. %Variance explained: This metric is used to evaluate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
2. Correlation coefficients (obs vs pred): This metric is used to evaluate the correlation between the measured and predicted values.
3. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): This metric is used to evaluate the difference between the measured and predicted values.
4. R2: This metric is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the RF model in the context, but they may not be applicable to deep learning models.
