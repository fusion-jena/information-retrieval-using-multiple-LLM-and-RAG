Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the use of 10-fold cross-validation, which is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. In 10-fold cross-validation, the data is split into 10 folds, and the model is trained on 9 folds and validated on the remaining 1 fold. This process is repeated 10 times, with each fold serving as the validation set once.

While this information is related to data splitting, it does not provide the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
