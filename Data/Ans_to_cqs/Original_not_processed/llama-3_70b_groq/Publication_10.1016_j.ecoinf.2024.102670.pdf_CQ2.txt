Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is working with image data, specifically karyotyping images of chromosomes and fungal images. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used. Additionally, there is no indication of CSV files being used as input data.

The context mentions the application of a 2nd-order Gaussian filter to the images, which suggests that the images are being processed as numerical arrays. The variation of parameters such as standard deviation Ïƒ and minimum branch length also implies that the images are being analyzed at a pixel level.

Furthermore, the mention of 3D volumetric images in the context of Guo et al. (2021) suggests that the deep learning pipeline may also be capable of handling 3D image data. However, the primary focus appears to be on 2D image data.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data, specifically 2D images, with possible extensions to 3D image data.
