Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the mention of "downstream tasks" and "recognition and detection tasks", it can be inferred that the models are likely used for classification, detection, or other related tasks. 

The context does not provide specific information about the exact purpose of the models, such as image segmentation, object detection, or image classification. It only mentions that ResNet has exhibited superior performance in various downstream recognition and detection tasks, but it does not specify what those tasks are.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
