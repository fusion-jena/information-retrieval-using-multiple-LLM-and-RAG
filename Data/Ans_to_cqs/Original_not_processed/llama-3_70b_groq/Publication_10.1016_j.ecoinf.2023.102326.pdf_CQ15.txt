Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or any specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to network analysis, specifically discussing the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) measure and its application to ecological informatics. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
