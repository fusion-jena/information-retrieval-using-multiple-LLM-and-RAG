Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on research related to soil degradation, land use, and ecosystem services, with references to various studies and datasets. There is no mention of deep learning model training or preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning in one of the studies (Huang et al., 2019). But it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in that study.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
