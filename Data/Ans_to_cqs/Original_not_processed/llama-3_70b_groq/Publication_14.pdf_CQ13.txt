Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or batch size. The text only mentions that the model was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps, but it does not provide further details about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
