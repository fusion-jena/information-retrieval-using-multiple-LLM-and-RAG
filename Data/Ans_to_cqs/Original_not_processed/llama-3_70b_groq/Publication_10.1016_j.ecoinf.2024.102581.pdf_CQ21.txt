Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance during training, including the accuracy and loss curves, and the hyperparameter search space for a CNN model. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps that may be applied after the model training.

However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps that may be involved after model training include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., to evaluate the model's performance.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
* Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the most important input features contributing to the model's predictions.
* Model interpretation: This involves analyzing the model's decisions and understanding how it is using the input features to make predictions.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps and may not be specific to the context provided.
