Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The text primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the MegaDetector model and discusses the limitations and challenges associated with wildlife camera trap data. It does mention the importance of having a thorough understanding of the model's strengths and limitations and the need for frequent and critical evaluations of model performance. However, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
