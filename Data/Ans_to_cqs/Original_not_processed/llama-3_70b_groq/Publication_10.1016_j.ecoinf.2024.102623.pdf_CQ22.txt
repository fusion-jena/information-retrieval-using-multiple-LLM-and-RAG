Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) and Mean AUPRG (Area Under the Precision-Recall Gain Curve). These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on multi-label classification tasks. 

The Mean AUC metric is used to evaluate the model's performance on a specific task, as shown in Table B.4. The Mean AUPRG metric is used to evaluate the model's performance across different species, as shown in Table C.8. 

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall metrics being used to evaluate the model's performance in the provided context.
