Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on groundwater-climate interactions, and it discusses datasets, spatial and temporal resolutions, and sources of data. It also mentions the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
