Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
