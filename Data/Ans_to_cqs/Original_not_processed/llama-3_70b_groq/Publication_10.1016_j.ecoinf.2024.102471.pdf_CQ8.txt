Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the Wav2vec model, its architecture, and its application in automatic speech recognition and bird species identification. It also explains the feature encoder and context network components of the model. However, it does not provide information about the code repository or where the implementation of the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
