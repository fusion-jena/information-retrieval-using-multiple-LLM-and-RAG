Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context discusses various topics, including land use change, ecosystem services, and optimization models, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
