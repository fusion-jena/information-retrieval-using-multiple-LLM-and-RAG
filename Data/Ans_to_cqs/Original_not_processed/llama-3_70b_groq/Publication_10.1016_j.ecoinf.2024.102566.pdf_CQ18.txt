Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various topics such as estimating forest biomass using LiDAR data, phytocoenological characteristics of Abies fargesii forests, and the importance of forest inventory data and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. However, it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
