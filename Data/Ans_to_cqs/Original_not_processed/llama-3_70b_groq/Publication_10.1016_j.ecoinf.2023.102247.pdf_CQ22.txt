Answer:::
The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, but the provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses an ensemble modeling approach using BIOMOD2 package in R, which combines four different models: regression-based, MaxEnt, RF (Random Forest), and SVM (Support Vector Machines).

According to the context, the performance of these models is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC), which is a measure of model accuracy. A higher AUC value indicates a more accurate model. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the performance of the models is evaluated using the AUC metric, but there is no information about the use of deep learning models or other evaluation metrics.
