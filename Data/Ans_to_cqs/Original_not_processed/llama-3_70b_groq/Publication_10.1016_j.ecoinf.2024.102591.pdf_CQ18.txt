Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires. This is mentioned in the text as "recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1)" which was used to determine the optimal number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) model.
