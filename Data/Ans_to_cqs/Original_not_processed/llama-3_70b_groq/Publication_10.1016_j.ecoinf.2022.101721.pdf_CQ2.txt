Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bat species identification using machine learning and bioacoustics, but it does not provide specific information about the data formats used in the pipeline. There are mentions of convolutional neural networks, which are often used for image classification tasks, but there is no explicit mention of image data formats. Similarly, there are mentions of bat calls and echolocation signals, which could imply audio data, but again, there is no explicit mention of audio data formats. Without more specific information, I cannot determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
