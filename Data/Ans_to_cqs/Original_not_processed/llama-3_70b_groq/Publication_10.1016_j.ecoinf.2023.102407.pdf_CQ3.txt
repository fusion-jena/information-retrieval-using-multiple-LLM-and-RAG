Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling and pseudo-labeling, which is a semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks. Pseudo-labeling involves using a trained model to assign labels to unlabeled data, which can then be used to train a student model. 

There is no mention of data annotation techniques typically used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection or image segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
