The provided context does not mention specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on ecological informatics, discussing model validation methods, metrics, and research questions, but it does not provide information on training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
