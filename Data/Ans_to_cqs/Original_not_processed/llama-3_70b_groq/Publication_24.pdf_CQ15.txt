Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the application of different normalization strategies to improve network accuracy, but it does not specify the optimization algorithms employed, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
