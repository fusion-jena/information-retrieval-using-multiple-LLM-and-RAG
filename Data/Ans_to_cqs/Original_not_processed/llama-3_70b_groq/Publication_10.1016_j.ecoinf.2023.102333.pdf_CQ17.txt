Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned is dropout regularization. Dropout regularization randomly removes different sets of neurons using a predetermined dropout rate, which results in training different neural networks and reduces overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). 

Although L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is a common regularization method used to prevent overfitting. However, it is not mentioned in the given text. 

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, it is possible that other regularization methods, such as L1 regularization, early stopping, or data augmentation, might be used in the deep learning pipeline, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
