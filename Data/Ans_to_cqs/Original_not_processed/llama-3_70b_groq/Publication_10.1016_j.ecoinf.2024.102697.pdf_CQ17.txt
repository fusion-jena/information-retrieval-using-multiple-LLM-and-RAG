Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. The context focuses on machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, and discusses the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results. It also mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
