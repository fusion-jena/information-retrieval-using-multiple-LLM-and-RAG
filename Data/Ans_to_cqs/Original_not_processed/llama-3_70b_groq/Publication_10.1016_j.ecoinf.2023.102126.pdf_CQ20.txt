Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be discussing data collection, evaluation, and visualization of datasets using tools such as the FAIRsFAIR team's computational notebook and the F-UJI assessment tool. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
