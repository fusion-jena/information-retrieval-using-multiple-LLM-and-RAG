Answer:::
Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer with default hyper-parameters. This is mentioned in the context as "TrunkNet is trained with the Adam optimizer with default hyper-parameters: (1) betas=(0.9, 0.999), (2) eps=1.0 Ã— 10^(-8), and (4) weight_decay = 0."
