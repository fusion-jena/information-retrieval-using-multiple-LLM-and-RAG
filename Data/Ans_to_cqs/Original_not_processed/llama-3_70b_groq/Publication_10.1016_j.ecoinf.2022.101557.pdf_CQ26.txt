Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses data pre-processing, convolutional neural networks, and data post-processing, but it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed. 

However, it is mentioned that the data is split into several larger blocks depending on coordinates for cross-validation, and then split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels. This could be a form of stratified splitting, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of dropout and ADAM optimization during training, but these are techniques used to prevent overfitting and optimize the model's performance, not specifically to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
