Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various online databases and platforms such as Macaulay Library, xeno-canto, iNaturalist, and GBIF, but these are sources of training data for the SILIC framework, not the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
