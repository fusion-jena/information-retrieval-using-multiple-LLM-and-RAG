Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the methodology used to develop the U-Net model, including data gathering, pre-processing, and training, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
