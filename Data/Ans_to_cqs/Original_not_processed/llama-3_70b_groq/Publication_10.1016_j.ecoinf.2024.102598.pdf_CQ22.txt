Answer: 

The context provided does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the performance evaluation of Machine Learning Models (MLMs) using several metrics. These metrics include:

1. AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics curve)
2. TSS (True Skill Statistics)
3. Kappa
4. Phi
5. Sensitivity
6. Specificity
7. Î” AUC (difference between the AUC of the training and test datasets)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the MLMs in predicting forest fire cases. The context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
