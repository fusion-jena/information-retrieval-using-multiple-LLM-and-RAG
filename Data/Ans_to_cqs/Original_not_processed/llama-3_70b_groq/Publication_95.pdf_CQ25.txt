Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident from the text, which mentions that the final classification layer was adapted to match the seven classes (six IAPS and "no species"). Additionally, the text mentions that the network models were trained to optimize the parameters and evaluate their performance on the validation set, which is a common approach in classification tasks. Furthermore, the use of cross-entropy loss, which is a common loss function for classification problems, also supports this conclusion.
