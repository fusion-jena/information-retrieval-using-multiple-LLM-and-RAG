Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the methodology, experimental design, and results of the study, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
