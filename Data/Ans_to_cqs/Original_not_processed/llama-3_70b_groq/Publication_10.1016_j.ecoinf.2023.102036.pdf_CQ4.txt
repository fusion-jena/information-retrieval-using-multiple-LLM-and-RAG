Answer:::
Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

* Affine transformations (scaling, translation, rotation, and shear)
* Pixel sum transformation
* Hue, saturation, and contrast modifications
* Adding Gaussian noise to images

Note that flipping (mirror flipping) is not mentioned as one of the selected data augmentation techniques, as it would change the pattern in the skin of individuals of the undulate skate, invalidating the generated image.
