Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the authors "optimized parameter setting of batch size" and set the batch size to 128, but it does not provide information on the method used to optimize the hyperparameters. It is possible that the authors used a method such as grid search or random search, but this is not specified in the text. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
