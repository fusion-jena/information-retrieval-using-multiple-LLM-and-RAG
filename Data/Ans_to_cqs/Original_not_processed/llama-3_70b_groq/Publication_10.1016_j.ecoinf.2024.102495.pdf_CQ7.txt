Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the model was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. This implies that the data was split into 10 folds, and the model was trained and evaluated on each fold, with 9 folds used for training and 1 fold used for testing. This process was repeated 10 times, with each fold used as the testing set once. 

It does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
