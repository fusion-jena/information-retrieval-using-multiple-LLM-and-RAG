Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of callbacks, including ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping, which can help prevent overfitting by dynamically modifying the learning rate and stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. These callbacks can help reduce overfitting, but they are not traditional regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used in this pipeline.
