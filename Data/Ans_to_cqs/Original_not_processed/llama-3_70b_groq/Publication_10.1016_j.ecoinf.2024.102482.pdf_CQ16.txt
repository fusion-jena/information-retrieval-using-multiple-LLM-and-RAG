Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text explains the structure of the proposed system, the composition of the experiments' data sets, and the performance metrics, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for training. It is possible that the authors used a common criterion such as validation loss plateau, but this is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given information.
