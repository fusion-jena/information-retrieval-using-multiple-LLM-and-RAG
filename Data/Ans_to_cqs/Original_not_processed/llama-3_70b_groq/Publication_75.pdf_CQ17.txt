Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "we periodically insert a pooling layer between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting." This suggests that the authors use pooling layers as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting. However, it does not mention other common regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
