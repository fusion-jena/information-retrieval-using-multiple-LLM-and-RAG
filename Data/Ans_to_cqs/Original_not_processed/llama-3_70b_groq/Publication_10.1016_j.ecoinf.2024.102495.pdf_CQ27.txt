Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of feature extraction parameters and the performance evaluation of different deep learning model configurations. It discusses the selection of optimal parameters for feature extraction and the evaluation of different models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, including model serialization and platform selection.
