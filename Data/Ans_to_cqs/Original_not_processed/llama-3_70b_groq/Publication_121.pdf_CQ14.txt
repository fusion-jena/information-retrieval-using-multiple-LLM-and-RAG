Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the optimizers used, such as SGD with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9, Adam optimizer, and Gradient descent. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were tuned or optimized. It is not clear if grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
