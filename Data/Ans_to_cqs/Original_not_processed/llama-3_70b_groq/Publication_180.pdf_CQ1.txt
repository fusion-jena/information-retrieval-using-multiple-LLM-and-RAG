Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of TensorFlow for automated species identification of Triatominae, vectors of Chagas disease, and the configuration of TensorFlow for this specific task. It does not provide information on how the raw data (images) were collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
