Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and batch normalization. These additional layers reduce the over-fitting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data. There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context.
