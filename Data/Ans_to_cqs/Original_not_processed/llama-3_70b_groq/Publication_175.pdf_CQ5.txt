Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in the context of ResNet achieving the best results in 2015. This implies that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used, but it is not explicitly stated as part of the pipeline. The context also mentions a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1â€“5 thumbnails per class, but it does not provide the name of this dataset. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
