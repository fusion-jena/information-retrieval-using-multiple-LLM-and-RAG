Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is time series data. This is evident from the mention of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) being used to process gridded data of a fixed size, which is suitable for time series data. Additionally, the use of Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) further supports this inference, as LSTM is commonly used for time series forecasting and analysis. 

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it can be assumed that the data is in a numerical format, possibly in CSV or similar format, given the mention of a comprehensive dataset being compiled and the use of a sliding window method to generate distinct datasets.
