Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the challenges of model training, the use of k-fold cross-validation to address these challenges, and the resulting accuracy curve graph. However, it does not specify the stopping criterion for training, such as a validation loss plateau.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
