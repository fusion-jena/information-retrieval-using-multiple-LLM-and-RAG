Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that the models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE, which is an indication of overfitting. This suggests that the authors may have used early stopping as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and a relatively small learning rate (0.001) may also help to prevent overfitting. However, it is not possible to determine from the provided context whether other regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization, were used.
