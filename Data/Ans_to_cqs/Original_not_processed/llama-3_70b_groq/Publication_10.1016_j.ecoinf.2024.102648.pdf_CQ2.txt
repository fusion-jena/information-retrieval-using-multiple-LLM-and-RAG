Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the mention of "image analysis with machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and model combination (MC) techniques" in the text, which suggests that image data is being used for plant disease severity estimation. Additionally, the illustration of major deep learning methods for prediction of CLCuD in upland cotton (Fig. 1) further supports this inference.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that other data formats such as CSV, audio, or video may also be used, but there is no concrete evidence to support this in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific data formats used are not explicitly mentioned.
