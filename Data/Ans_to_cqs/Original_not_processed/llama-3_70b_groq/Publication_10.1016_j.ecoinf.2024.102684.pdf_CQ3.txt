Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, LiDAR data, and the application of deep learning models, particularly CNNs, for tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection. While it discusses various architectures and approaches, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
