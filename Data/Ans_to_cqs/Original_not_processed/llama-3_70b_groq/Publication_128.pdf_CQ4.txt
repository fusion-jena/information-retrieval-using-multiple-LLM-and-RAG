Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training parameters of various neural network models, including AlexNet, MobileNet, and ResNet. It discusses the input data resolution, batch normalization, batch size, activation functions, learning rate, dropout rate, and training epochs, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
