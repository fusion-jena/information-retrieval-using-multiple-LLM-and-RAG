Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), and it discusses various functions and arguments for filtering and embedding covariates. There is no mention of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
