Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to classify dolphin sounds into different species. The study uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build models that can accurately classify dolphin calls. The models are trained on a dataset of dolphin sounds and are evaluated based on their validation accuracy and precision. The study compares the performance of different models with varying window sizes and architectures to determine the best approach for classifying dolphin sounds.
