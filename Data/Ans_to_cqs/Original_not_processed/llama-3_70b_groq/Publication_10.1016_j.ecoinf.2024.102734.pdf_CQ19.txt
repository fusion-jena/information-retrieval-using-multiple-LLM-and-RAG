Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). It only discusses the architectures and models used, such as ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, but does not provide information about the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
