Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the need for training bespoke neural networks for species sets, reducing power consumption of the DynAIkonTrap, and implementing neural networks on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for improved performance and power efficiency. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
