Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms, Bayesian optimizers, and TDO for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
