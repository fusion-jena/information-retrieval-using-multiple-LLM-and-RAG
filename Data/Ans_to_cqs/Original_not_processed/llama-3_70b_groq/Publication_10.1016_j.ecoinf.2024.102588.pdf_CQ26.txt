Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of batch normalization and dropout layers to assist in feature extraction and reduce overfitting in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It also discusses the use of autoencoders to extract discriminative features and overcome the limitations of static input data.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias in machine learning models, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
