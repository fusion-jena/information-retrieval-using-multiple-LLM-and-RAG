Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, the models are used for plant species classification, disease detection in crops, and identifying medicinal plants. For instance, the study by Barhate et al. (2023) used VGG-16 and dimensionality reduction with ESPCA to classify thirty-two plant species. Similarly, Ganguly et al. (2022) utilized the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns for plant species classification. Other studies mentioned in the context also focus on classification tasks, such as identifying medicinal plants, detecting diseases in crops, and classifying plant species in the Borneo region.
