Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including CNN, RNN, and sequence neural networks. Specifically, the pre-trained CNN models used are EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. Additionally, sequence neural networks such as LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM are used in Approach 3, with the most accurate model being the GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM (BivalveNet). There is no mention of Transformer models in the provided context.
