Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distributions, and vegetation history, with references to scientific papers and tables of data. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
