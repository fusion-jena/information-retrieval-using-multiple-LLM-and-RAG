Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant leaf classification, and it provides information on the search space of CNN hyperparameters, performance comparisons with existing transfer learning approaches, and other related details. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
