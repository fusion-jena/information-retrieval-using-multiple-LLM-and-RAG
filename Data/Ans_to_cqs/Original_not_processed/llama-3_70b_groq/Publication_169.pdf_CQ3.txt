Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and their applications in image recognition, particularly in plant species recognition. It discusses various CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
