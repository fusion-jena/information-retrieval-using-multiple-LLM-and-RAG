Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to various topics such as plant physiology, fog computing, smartphone-based optical assays, thermal-RGB imaging systems, and SPAD value modeling, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
