Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing dimensionality reduction methods, specifically UMAP, and its application to species distribution modeling using bioclimatic variables. It does not provide information on how to split data for deep learning model training.
