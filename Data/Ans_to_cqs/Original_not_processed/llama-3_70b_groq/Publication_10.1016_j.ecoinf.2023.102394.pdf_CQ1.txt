Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that public datasets are used, as the context mentions retrieving a set of 2207 SOCS data from a database. Additionally, the context cites a study by Xu, He, and Yu (2019) that provides a dataset of carbon density in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems, suggesting that public datasets are used as a source of raw data.

It is also possible that sensors are used for data collection, as the context mentions soil mapping and soil organic carbon storage, which may involve the use of sensors to collect data on soil properties. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

There is no mention of surveys being used for data collection in the provided context. Overall, it can be concluded that public datasets are likely used as a source of raw data, and sensors may also be used, but the context does not provide explicit information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
