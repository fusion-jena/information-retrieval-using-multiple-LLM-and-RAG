Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text discusses a research study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). There is no mention of a code repository or a link to a specific platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
