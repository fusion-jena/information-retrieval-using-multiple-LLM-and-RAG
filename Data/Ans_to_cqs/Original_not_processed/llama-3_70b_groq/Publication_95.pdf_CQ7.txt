Answer:::

According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the naive approach is to randomly sample images from the full data set, but this approach may lead to information leakage between the data sets due to images being captured in close proximity and potentially having overlapping fields of views.

It is also mentioned that the data sets should be independent and have similar class distributions to ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and the test set. However, the specific criteria or methods used to achieve this independence and similar class distributions are not specified.

In the context of the provided experiment, the data is split into training, validation, and test sets, but the exact criteria used for this split are not provided. The training set is used for optimizing the parameters of the network, the validation set is used for monitoring the performance of the network during training, and the test set acts as a final evaluation of the network.
