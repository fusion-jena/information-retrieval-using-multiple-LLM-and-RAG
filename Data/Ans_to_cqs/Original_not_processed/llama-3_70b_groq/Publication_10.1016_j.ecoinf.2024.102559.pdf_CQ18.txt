Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a classification problem involving iceplant and other vegetation, with various tables and metrics presented, but it does not provide information on the training process or performance monitoring.

The tables and metrics presented seem to be focused on evaluating the model's performance on test data, such as accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and confusion matrices. However, the context does not provide insight into how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
