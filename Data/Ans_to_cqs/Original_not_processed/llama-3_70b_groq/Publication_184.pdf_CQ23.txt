Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to extend the amount of data, which can help improve the model's generalizability. Additionally, the model was trained on a dataset with varying environment circumstances, such as separated fish in seagrass, a shoal of fish, tiny fish, occlusion by corals, and shading and light conditions, which can also contribute to the model's ability to generalize. 

It is worth noting that the model was trained on a limited number of samples, and each image was used multiple times due to the limited number of samples, which may affect the model's generalizability. However, the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability are not specified in the provided context.
