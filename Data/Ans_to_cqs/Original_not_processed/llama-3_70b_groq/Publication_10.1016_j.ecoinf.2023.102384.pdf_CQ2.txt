Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. There are multiple references to image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation, suggesting that images are the primary data format used in the pipeline. 

For instance, the paper by Simonyan and Zisserman (2015) discusses very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. Similarly, the work by Wang et al. (2020) introduces a large-scale dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection, which implies that images are used for object detection tasks. 

Additionally, the description of the training and validation phases, where images are broken down into smaller patches and augmented through horizontal and vertical flipping, further supports the notion that images are the primary data format used in the pipeline.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a file format commonly used for tabular data, but it is not mentioned in the context of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
