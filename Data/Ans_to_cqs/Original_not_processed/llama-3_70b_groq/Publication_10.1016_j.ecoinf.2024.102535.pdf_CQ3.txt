Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the challenges of manual annotation of seabed images, the emergence of computer tools for automatic analysis, and the architecture of a deep learning model inspired by VGG. It also mentions data augmentation techniques such as 90Â° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips, but it does not specify the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
