Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the parameters x, u, and y were refined through several hundred independent simulations, varying the parameter values to optimize the model. However, it does not specify the optimization method used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
