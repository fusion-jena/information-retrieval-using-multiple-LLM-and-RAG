Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of different object detection models, such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, and Sparse CNN, on a proposed dataset, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was constructed or split to ensure generalizability.

The context does provide the number of images used for training and validation (Table 3), but it does not mention cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other techniques used to ensure the model's performance on unseen data. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
