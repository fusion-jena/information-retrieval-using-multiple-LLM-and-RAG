Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context discusses various deep learning models and their performance on seagrass detection tasks, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
