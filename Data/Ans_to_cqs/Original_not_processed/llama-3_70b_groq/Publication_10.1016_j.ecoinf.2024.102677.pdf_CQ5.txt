Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, according to Table 1, the datasets used in this study are related to rural ecological informatics and include:

* GDP (Gross Domestic Product) dataset
* NTL (Nighttime-Light) dataset
* NPP (Net Primary Productivity of vegetation) dataset

These datasets are sourced from various websites, including resdc.cn, tpdc.ac.cn, and earthdata.nasa.gov. The study fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, using these datasets.
