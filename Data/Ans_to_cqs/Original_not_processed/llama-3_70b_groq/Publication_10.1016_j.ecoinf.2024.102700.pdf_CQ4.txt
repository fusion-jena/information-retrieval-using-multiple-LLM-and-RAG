Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses a literature search and screening process for studies on species habitat modeling, and it mentions the use of machine learning techniques, including Maxent and deep learning strategies, but it does not provide details on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
