Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on Genetic Programming (GP) and its application in feature selection and modeling, as well as Wavelet signal analysis. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
