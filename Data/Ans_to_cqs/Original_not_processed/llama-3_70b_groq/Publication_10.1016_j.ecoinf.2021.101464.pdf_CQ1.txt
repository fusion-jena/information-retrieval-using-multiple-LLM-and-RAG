Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data. The context mentions various sensor models, including:

* AV-10 T temperature sensor with a measurement range of 45-65°C, installed 0.2 m below the soil
* HMP155 temperature and humidity sensor with a temperature measurement range of -80 to 60°C and humidity measurement range of 0-100%
* WindSonic anemometer for measuring wind speed with a range of 0-60 m/s
* AV-410BP atmospheric pressure sensor with a measurement range of 600-1100 hPa
* LI-190SB photosynthetically active radiation sensor with a measurement range of 400-700 nm
* LI-200× direct radiation sensor with a measurement range of 400-1100 nm
* CUV5 ultraviolet radiation sensor with a measurement range of 210-380 nm
* CNR4 net radiation sensor with a measurement range of 300-2800 nm
* RR-9421 particulate matter 2.5 sensor

These sensors are used to collect data on various environmental parameters, which are then stored by a CR1000 collector with a sampling frequency of 15 s/time and a storage period of 10 min. The data is automatically transmitted in real-time to a server through a DTU900C GPRS remote transmission module.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context.
