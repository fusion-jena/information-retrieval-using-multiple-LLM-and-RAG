Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, which might contribute to the model's generalizability. 

Additionally, the hyperparameters used in training the proposed model are based on the optimized values for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch, which might imply that the model is designed to be generalizable to different datasets. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
