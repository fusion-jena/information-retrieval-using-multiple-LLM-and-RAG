Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the challenges of collecting and annotating large datasets for individual bird identification, especially in wild animal populations. It highlights the need for new ways to collect training data that do not rely on individual manual image annotation. However, it does not specify the annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context focuses on the use of RFID technology to automate data collection and the application of deep learning for individual bird identification. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used to prepare the training datasets.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
