Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline is Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). This is mentioned in Figure 1, which describes a conceptual figure of the proposed semi-supervised pipeline. The figure states that a LIDAR-based unsupervised detection generates initial training data for a self-supervised deep learning model.

Additionally, the study site used in the research is the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California, which suggests that the data may be collected through a network of sensors or observational systems.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection in the provided context. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in conjunction with LIDAR and NEON site data, but this is not explicitly stated.
