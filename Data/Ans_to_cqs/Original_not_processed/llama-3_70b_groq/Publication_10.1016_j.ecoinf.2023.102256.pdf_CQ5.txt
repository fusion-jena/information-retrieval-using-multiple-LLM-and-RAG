Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a bird species classification task, and it mentions a custom dataset with 8,836 species, but only 22 species are involved in the study. There is no mention of any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
