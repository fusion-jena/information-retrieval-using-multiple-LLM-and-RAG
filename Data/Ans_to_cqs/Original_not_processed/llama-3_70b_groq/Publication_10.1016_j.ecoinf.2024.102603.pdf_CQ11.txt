Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. It also mentions various instruments and satellites used for retrieving data, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
