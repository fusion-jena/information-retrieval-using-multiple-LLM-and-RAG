Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers related to deep learning and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
