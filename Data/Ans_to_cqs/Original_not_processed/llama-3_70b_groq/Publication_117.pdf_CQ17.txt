Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning and a multipart loss function. The multipart loss function is described in Redmon et al. (2016), but the context does not provide further details about the specific regularization methods used.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a "no-object component" in the multipart loss function, which is weighted more heavily (from 0.5 to 2) to reduce the number of empty images that citizen counters need to process. This could be related to class imbalance or a similar issue, but it is not a traditional regularization method.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
