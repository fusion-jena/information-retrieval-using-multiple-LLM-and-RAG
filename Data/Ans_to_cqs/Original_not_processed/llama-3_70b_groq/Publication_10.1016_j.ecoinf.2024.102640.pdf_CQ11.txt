Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of SegFormer, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation, and the construction of a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) for GVI extraction. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the pipeline or dataset can be accessed.
