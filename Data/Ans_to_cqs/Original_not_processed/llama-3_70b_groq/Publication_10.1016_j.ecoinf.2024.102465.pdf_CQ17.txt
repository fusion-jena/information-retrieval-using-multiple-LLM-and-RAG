Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, such as HRNet, for semantic segmentation and image analysis, as well as the use of NLP models for text data sentiment scoring. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline, and it is possible that regularization methods were used but not explicitly mentioned. If you are looking for information on regularization methods, I can suggest that common techniques include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation, among others.
