Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model evaluation process, including the iteration termination condition, error evaluation metrics (overall error, commission error, and omission error), and the comparison of different training modes (zero-start and incremental training) on different platforms (GPU server and desktop PC).

However, it can be inferred that the model evaluation process involves the calculation of metrics such as overall error, commission error, and omission error, as defined by equations (2), (3), and (4). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in different training phases.

There is no mention of postprocessing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other techniques. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
