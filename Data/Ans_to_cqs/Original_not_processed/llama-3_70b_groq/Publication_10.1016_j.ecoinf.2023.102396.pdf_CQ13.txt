Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing ecological informatics and population models, specifically the Gompertz population model for feature extractions of population time series. It mentions natural log transformations and variance (Ïƒ2), but there is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
