Answer:::

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context mentions machine learning models, including Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
