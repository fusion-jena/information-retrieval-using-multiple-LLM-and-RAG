Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. It discusses data filtering, spatial scaling, and temporal aggregation of environmental data to match with ecological processes. It also mentions formulas for aggregating data, such as mean, median, or standard deviation, but it does not provide information on how hyperparameters of a model are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
