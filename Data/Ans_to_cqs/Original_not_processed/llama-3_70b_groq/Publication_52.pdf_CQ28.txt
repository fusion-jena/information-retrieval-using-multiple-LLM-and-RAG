Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the research paper's topic, which is the use of extreme deep learning for biosecurity, specifically for marine species identification. It discusses the innovative approach and algorithms used, such as the MIGRATE_ELM and Geo Location Country Based Service, but does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
