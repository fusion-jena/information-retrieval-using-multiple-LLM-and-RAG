Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on presenting the accuracy metrics and classification results of different models using various features and window sizes. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the models were tested on multiple window sizes, which might suggest that the authors attempted to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data. Additionally, the presence of multiple tables with varying window sizes and feature combinations implies that the authors experimented with different approaches to improve the model's performance. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
