Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include:

1. Metrics calculation: The context mentions the calculation of metrics such as mAP@0.5:0.95 (%), FPS (frames per second), and FLOPs (floating-point operations per second).

2. Visualization: The context mentions visualizations including label, mask, and heat maps, which provide comprehensive insights into the dataset's structure and diversity.

However, there is no mention of specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. It is possible that these steps may be involved, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions non-maximum suppression, which is a common postprocessing step in object detection tasks, but it is not clear if this is part of the model training or inference process.

In summary, the provided context suggests that metrics calculation and visualization are part of the postprocessing steps, but it does not provide explicit information about Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
