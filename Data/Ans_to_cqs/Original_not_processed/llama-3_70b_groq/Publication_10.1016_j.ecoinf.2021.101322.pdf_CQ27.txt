Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the implementation and training of the CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow, and provides information about the dataset and pre-trained weights used. It does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
