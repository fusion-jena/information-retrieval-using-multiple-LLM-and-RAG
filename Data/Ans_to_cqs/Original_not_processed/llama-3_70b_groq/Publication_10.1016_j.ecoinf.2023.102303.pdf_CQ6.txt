Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that during the self-supervised contrastive learning phase, the input images are augmented with random horizontal flipping, random ±7o rotation, and random ±40% brightness. This suggests that some form of data augmentation is involved, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
