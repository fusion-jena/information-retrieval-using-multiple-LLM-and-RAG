Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the training of neural networks, stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation, and the use of pre-trained CNNs for image recognition tasks. It also discusses the applications of computer vision and deep learning in ecology and evolutionary biology.

However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or any other techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
