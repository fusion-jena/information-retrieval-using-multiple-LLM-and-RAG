Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context is a ratio of 75:25. The dataset was divided into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images. This means that 75% of the data was used for training and 25% was used for testing. There is no explicit mention of a validation set in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the test set is used for model validation, as the performance of the models is evaluated by calculating accuracies and losses of training samples in each epoch using the test dataset.
