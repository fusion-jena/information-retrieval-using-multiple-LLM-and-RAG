Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a research paper on wildlife conservation, specifically discussing a method called FIT (not specified what FIT stands for) for non-invasive survey methods, and does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
