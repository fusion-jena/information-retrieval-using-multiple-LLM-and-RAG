Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the overall methodology, including the use of Landsat 8 imagery, Deep Neural Network models, and Google Cloud computing, but it does not provide specific details about the annotation techniques employed.

However, it can be inferred that the approach involves collecting spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas, which are then used to train the deep learning models. The context mentions that the training samples are "well distributed in space," but it does not elaborate on how these samples are annotated.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not available in the provided context.
