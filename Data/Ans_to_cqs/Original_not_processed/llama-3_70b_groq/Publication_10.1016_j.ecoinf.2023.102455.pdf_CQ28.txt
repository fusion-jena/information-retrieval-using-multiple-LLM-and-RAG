Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the architecture and hyperparameters of various deep learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and others, as well as their performance metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE. However, there is no mention of the deployment platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
