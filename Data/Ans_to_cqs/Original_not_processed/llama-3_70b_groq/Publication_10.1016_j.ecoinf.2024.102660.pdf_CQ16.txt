Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the training persisted for 120 epochs with a batch size set to 8, and the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. However, it does not specify whether the training was stopped based on a validation loss plateau or any other criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
