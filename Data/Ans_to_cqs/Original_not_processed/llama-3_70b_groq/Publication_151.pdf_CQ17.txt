Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the evaluation of DEPP on simulated data sets, training and parameter sensitivity, and the placement of query sequences onto a reference tree. It discusses the training process, batch size, and stopping criteria, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
