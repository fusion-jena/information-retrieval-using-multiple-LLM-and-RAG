Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the importance of splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, and it mentions the concept of "annotation size" relative to image size, but it does not specify the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
