Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned in the context. According to the text, the training protocol for the deep learning architectures involves stochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10^(-2). The learning rate is divided by 10 every 20 epochs until it reaches 10^(-6). No other hyperparameters are explicitly mentioned in the context.
