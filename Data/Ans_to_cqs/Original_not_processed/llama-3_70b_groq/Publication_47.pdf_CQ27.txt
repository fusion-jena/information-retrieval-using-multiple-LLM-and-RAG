Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training and testing of the IUC-NN model, its architecture, and the features used, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed.

The context mentions that the IUC-NN model was implemented as an R package (IUCNN) based on the Python TensorFlow library, but it does not provide details on how the model was serialized, which platform was selected for deployment, or any other deployment-related steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
