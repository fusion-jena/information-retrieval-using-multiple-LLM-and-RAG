Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and disease detection, highlighting the potential of these models in improving agricultural practices and crop yield. It also mentions various studies that have used deep learning approaches for plant species classification, but it does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in these studies. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
