Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables, and mentions other machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, random forests, genetic algorithms, and maximum entropy. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam.
