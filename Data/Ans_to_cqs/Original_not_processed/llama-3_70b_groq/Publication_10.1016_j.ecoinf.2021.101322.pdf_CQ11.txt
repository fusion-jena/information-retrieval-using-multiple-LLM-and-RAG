Answer:::
Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions DOIs for image datasets (doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887 and doi:10.21) and a GitHub link for the EfficientNet architecture (https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet), but it does not provide a link to a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF for the deep learning pipeline.
