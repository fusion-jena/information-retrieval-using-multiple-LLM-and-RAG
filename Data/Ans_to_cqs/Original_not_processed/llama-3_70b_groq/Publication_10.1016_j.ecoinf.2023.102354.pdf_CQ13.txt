Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on drought characteristics, climate indices, and groundwater-climate interactions, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model's architecture or training parameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
