Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the prototypical network, template matching, and post-processing techniques used in the audio classification task. It does not provide information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
