Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, deep learning architectures, and applications in remote sensing and image processing. 

However, it is worth noting that data bias is a crucial aspect of machine learning, and addressing it is essential to ensure the model's reliability and generalizability. Common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as mentioned in the query. These techniques can help mitigate bias by ensuring a balanced dataset, increasing the representation of underrepresented classes, or reducing the impact of overrepresented classes.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on these techniques or any other methods used to address data bias during preprocessing.
