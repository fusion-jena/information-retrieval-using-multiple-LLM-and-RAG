Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training and prediction procedures, the architecture selection, and the implementation details of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Python 3. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context only mentions that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using an instance with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM, and that the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system was used. It does not provide details on how the trained model was serialized, selected for deployment, or deployed on a specific platform.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
