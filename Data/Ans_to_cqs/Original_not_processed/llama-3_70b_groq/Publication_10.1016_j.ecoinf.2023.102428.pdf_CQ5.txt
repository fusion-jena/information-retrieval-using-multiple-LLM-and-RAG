Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and Markov chain (MC) model. The datasets used in this study are likely to be related to LULC classification, but the specific datasets are not mentioned.

However, Table 1 in the context provides information about the raster and supplementary data used in the study, which includes data from USGS Earth Explorer. The data types, sources, dates acquired, path and rows, resolution, columns and rows, and bands are listed, but the specific datasets are not named.

Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
