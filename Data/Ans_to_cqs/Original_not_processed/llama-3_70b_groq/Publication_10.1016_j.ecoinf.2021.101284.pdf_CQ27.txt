Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context appears to be related to a research paper on COVID-19 and air pollution, and it discusses various models (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) and their parameters, but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model. The only mention of deep learning is in a reference to a paper by Castillo (2020) on early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients using deep learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on deployment.
