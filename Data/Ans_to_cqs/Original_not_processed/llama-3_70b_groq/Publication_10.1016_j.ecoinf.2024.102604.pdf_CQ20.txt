Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide any information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
