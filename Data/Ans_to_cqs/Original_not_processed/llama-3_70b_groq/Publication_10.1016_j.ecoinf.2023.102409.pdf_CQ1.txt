Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of remote sensing images and existing datasets. Specifically, the study uses high-resolution (0.8 m) remote sensing images to generate high-precision Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) in drylands.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of groundwater monitoring data collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin to construct a Machine Learning model. This model is used to derive mean groundwater data from April to September, featuring a 10 m resolution.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for raw data collection in the provided context. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in other deep learning pipelines, but this information is not provided in the given context.

It is also worth noting that the study uses existing datasets, such as climate and DEM data, which are resampled to 10 m spatial resolution through ArcGIS. Furthermore, land use/land cover data from ESRI and ESA are used for comparison with the FVC map generated by the deep learning models.
