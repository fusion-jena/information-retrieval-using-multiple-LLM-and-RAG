Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does provide information about a custom dataset used in the study. 

According to Table 2, the dataset consists of three classes: circular curves, straight lines, and 8-shaped curves, with 10 videos each, and a total of 27,819, 41,225, and 20,340 images, respectively. The duration of the videos is 927 seconds, 1374 seconds, and 678 seconds, respectively. 

Therefore, the answer is that the dataset used in this study is a custom dataset consisting of images of circular curves, straight lines, and 8-shaped curves, but it does not mention the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
