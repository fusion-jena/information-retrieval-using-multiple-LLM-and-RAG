Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, specifically random forests, but it does not provide information about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
