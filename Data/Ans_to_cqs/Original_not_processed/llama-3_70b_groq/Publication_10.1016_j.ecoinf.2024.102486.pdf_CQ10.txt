Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various tools and libraries such as the Deep Learning Toolbox, cuDNN, and Darknet, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Additionally, it provides instructions for setting up a CUDA-capable Virtual Machine instance on Google Cloud, but it does not mention a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
