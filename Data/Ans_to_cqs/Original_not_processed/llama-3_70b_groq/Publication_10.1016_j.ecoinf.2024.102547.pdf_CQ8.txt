Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing functional data analysis (FDA) and its applications in marine conservation efforts. It cites various studies and references related to FDA, but does not mention a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
