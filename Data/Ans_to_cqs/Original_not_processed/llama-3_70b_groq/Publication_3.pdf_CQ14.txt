Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the calibration of models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps and considers two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
