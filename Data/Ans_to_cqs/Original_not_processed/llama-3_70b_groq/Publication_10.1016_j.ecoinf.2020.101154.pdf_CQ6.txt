Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model training, and data splitting approaches for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps that are typically performed before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
