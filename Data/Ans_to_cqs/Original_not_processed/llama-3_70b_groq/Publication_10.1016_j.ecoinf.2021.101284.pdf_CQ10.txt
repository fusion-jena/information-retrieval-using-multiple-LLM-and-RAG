Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics such as ecological informatics, COVID-19, and air pollution. There are references to various sources, including the World Health Organization, Wikipedia, and academic papers, but no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository.
