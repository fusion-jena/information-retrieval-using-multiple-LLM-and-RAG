Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of CNN architectures, remote sensing data, and environmental factors to predict water quality and algal blooms, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The references cited are academic papers and do not mention cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, I cannot determine the deployment platform used in this study.
