Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention two techniques used to improve the generalization capability of the model: 

1. Local Response Normalization (LRN): This technique is used to normalize the local response, which enhances larger response values and reduces smaller response values. This helps to improve the generalization of the model.

2. Dropout layer: The tenth layer of the model is a dropout layer, which is used to improve the generalization capability of the model.

These two techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. However, the context does not provide information on other measures that may have been taken to ensure generalizability, such as dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
