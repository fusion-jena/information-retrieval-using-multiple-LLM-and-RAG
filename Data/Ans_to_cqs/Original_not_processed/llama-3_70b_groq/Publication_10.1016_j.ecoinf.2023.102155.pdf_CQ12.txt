Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text mentions machine learning and semi-supervised learning, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context focuses on mixture modeling (EM algorithm) and mentions methods such as knn and kmeans, but it does not provide information about deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
