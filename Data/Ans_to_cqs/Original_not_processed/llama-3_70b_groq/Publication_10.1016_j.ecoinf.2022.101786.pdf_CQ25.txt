Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. 

The context suggests that the model is trained to predict bounding boxes with confidence scores, which is a typical output of object detection models. The model is evaluated by comparing its predictions with manual annotations, which further supports the idea that the model is performing object detection. Additionally, the context mentions that the model is trained using the Darknet framework, which is commonly used for object detection tasks.
