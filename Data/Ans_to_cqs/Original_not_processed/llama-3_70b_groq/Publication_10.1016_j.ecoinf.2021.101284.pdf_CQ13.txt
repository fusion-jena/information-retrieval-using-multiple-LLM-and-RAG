Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context appears to be discussing a different topic, focusing on data processing results and analysis related to COVID-19 cases, air pollution, and geographic conditions. The only mention of a deep learning algorithm is in a reference to a paper by Castillo (2020), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
