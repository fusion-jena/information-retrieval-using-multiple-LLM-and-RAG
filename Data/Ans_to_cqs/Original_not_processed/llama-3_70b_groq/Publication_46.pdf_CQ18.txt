Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the model validation process, where the performance of the species distribution model is evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric. The AUC value is used to compare the performance of the CNN model with the BIOCLIM model. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
