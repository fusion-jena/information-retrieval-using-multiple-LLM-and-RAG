Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different classification models, such as ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, and their performance on a dataset of possum vocalisations and noise sources.

However, it can be inferred that the data is in the form of audio spectrograms, which are used as input to the models. The context also mentions that the data must be downsampled to 16 kHz due to the limitation of the pretrained AST model being designed for human-perceivable sounds.

No information is provided about normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
