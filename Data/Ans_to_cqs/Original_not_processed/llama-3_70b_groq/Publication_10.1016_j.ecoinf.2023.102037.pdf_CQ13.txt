Answer:::
The provided context mentions some hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, but not all. Specifically, it mentions:

* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9.
* Batch size: 16 tiles at a time, motivated by the available GPU memory and training efficiency.
* Number of epochs: 150.
* Data augmentation: The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training to improve the model robustness.
* IoU threshold: Predicted bounding boxes with intersection-over-union (IoU) â‰¥ 0.6 were considered positive, while bounding boxes with IoU < 0.6 were considered negative.

However, it does not mention the learning rate, which is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the learning rate used in this model.
