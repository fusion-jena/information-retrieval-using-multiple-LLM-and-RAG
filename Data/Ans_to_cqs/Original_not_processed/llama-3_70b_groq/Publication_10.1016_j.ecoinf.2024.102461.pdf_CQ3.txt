Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the classification of fire risk maps using Jenks' natural break classification method and mentions the use of remote sensing data, artificial neural networks, and deep learning, but it does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
