Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of artificial neural networks, specifically the NARX model, for modeling and predicting vegetation biomass density. It also mentions the development of a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware components.
