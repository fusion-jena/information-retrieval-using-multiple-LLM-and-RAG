Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on map evaluation, statistical prediction methods, and resampling techniques for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps.

However, it does mention stratified sampling as a technique used to produce a moderately clustered sample. Stratified sampling is a method that divides the population into subgroups or strata and then selects a random sample from each stratum. This technique can help reduce bias by ensuring that the sample is representative of the population.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not discussed in the provided context. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to address class imbalance and data bias issues, but they are not mentioned in the context of map evaluation and resampling methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be used to address data bias is stratified sampling.
