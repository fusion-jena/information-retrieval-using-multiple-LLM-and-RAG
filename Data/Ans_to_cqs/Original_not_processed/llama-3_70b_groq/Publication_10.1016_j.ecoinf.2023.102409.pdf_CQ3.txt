Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning algorithms and their applications in geographical and ecological challenges, such as image segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It discusses the architectures of models like U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet), and DeepLabV3+, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, as it involves labeling and preparing the data for training models. Common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and classification. However, without specific information on the annotation techniques used in the context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
