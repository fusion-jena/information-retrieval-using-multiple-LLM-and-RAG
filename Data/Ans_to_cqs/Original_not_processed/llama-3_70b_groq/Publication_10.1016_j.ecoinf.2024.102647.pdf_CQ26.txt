Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to discuss the utilization of available well data, revising answers to focus on questions, and the potential of machine learning algorithms to improve understanding and decision-making outcomes. It also mentions feature selection, but it does not provide specific details on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
