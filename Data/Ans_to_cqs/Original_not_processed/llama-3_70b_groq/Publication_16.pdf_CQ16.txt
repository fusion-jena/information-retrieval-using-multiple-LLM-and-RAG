Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the accuracy of the model flattens towards the end of the training session, indicating that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence is sufficient. This is mentioned in the text: "The results illustrate that the accuracy of the model flattens towards the end of the training session and shows that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence is sufficient." This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is monitored during training, and when the accuracy plateaus, training is considered complete.
