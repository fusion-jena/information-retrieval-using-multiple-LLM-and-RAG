Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is data validation. This is done by performing a holdback trial partitioning test on the training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. The analysis is iterated 10 times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails, to examine how the predicted outcome compares with the known test set size. This process helps to determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algorithm training set and test sets that could provide an accurate population estimate.
