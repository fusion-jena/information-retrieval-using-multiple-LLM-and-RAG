Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are used for processing image data in LaDeco. Specifically, a Nvidia-RTX5000 GPU was used in the study to analyze 8301 images. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used. Therefore, it can be concluded that GPUs are used for processing image data, but it is unclear if they are used for training the deep learning model as well.
