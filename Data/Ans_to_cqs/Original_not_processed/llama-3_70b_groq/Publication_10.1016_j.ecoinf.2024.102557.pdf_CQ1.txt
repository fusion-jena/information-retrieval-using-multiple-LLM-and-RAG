Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 years in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This suggests that the data collection method involves field-based sampling and observation of macrofungal productivity in these plots. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection. The context implies that the data is collected through a long-term, intensive field-based effort, resulting in a unique and extensive database of macrofungal productivity.
