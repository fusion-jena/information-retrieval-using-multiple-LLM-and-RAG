Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, time-lapse camera trap images are mentioned in the context of animal detection (Price Tack et al., 2016). Additionally, arboreal camera trapping is mentioned as a method for collecting data (Gregory et al., 2014). This suggests that camera traps are used to capture images of animals in their natural habitats, which are then used as raw data for training and testing deep learning models.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context mentions the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning of neural networks. However, the specific public datasets used are not mentioned.

No mention is made of surveys as a method for collecting raw data. Sensors are not explicitly mentioned either, although camera traps can be considered a type of sensor.

Overall, the context suggests that camera traps are a primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, with possible use of public datasets as well.
