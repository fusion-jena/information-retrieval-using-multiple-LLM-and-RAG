Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to research papers on bears, wildlife conservation, and human-wildlife conflicts, but it does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness. The context seems to be focused on ecology and conservation biology, and does not provide any information on machine learning or deep learning. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
