Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization, which can help with reducing overfitting. Additionally, the context discusses data augmentation as a means to enhance generalization and model accuracy, which can also help prevent overfitting. However, it does not mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
