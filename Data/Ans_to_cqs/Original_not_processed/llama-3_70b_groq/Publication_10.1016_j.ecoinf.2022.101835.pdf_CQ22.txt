Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in this context are mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). Additionally, the root mean square error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models and the performance of the models for each observation site. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics in this context.
