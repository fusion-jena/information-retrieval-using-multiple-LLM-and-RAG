Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are related to metrics calculation. Specifically, the context mentions the calculation of UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE metrics, which are used to evaluate the performance of the model on the UCCS dataset. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the attention of the model, but the context only mentions spatial attention maps, which are used within the model architecture. Confusion matrices are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but the context does not suggest that the model is a classification model.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training seem to be limited to metrics calculation, specifically the calculation of UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE metrics.
