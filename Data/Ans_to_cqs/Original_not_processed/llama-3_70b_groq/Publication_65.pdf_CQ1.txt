Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation tasks, specifically for detecting trees in urban areas. It mentions the use of a dataset with a high spatial resolution (Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 10 cm) inside an urban area within the Cerrado biome, but it does not provide information on how this dataset was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
