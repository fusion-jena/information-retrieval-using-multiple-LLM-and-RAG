Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the hardware platform used for the experiment, which is a desktop computer with specific specifications, and the software platforms used, such as Anaconda3, PyCharm, Python, TensorFlow, and MATLAB. There is no mention of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
