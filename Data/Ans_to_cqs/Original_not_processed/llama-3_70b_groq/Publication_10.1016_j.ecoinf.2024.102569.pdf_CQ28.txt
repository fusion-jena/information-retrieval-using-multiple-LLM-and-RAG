Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species observation data, and crowdsourcing, but it does not provide any information about the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for it. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
