Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

In Table 3, a confusion matrix is presented for the first CNN (5 classes), which suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using this matrix. The table shows the predicted values against the actual values, and the accuracy of the model is calculated for each class.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in the model's predictions, but they are not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as evident from the context, are metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix.
