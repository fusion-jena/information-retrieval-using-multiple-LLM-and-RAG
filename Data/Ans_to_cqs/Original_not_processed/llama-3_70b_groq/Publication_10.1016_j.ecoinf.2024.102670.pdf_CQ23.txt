Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods to karyotyping images of chromosomes and measuring the length of mycelium filaments. It discusses the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation and the evaluation of the agreement between the gold standard method and the proposed automated method. However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
