Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text discusses a study on predicting the distribution of a species using an ensemble modeling approach in BIOMOD2 package in R, and mentions the use of climate scenarios and habitat variables. It does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
