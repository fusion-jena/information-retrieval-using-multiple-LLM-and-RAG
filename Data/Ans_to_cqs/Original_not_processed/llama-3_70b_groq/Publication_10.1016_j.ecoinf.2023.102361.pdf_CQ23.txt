Answer:::

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing, with 60% of the data used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but the specifics of how the data was split are not provided.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any specific techniques used to ensure diversity in the dataset or to prevent overfitting, such as data augmentation or regularization techniques. Therefore, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context mentions data splitting, it does not provide sufficient information to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
