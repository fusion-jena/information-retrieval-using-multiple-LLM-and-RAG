Answer::: 
The deep learning model is built using the Keras library with Theano as the backend. This is stated in the experimental setup section: "The CNN-LSTM Model was implemented with the python library, using Theano and Keras." There is no mention of TensorFlow or PyTorch being used in the model implementation.
