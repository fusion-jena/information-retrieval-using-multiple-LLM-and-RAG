Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. It discusses the calculation of NDVI values, the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classification analysis, and the division of NDVI products into six classes. There is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters, let alone how they are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
