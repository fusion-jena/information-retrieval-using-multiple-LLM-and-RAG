Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the development and comparison of the deep learning model with a random forest regression model for species richness estimation. It discusses the model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
