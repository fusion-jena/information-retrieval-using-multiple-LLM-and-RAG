Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it is mentioned that "data augmentation by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle" is applied due to the small sample size. This technique helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. Additionally, while the context mentions the importance of the protocol of image acquisition and controlled object position during data collection, it does not explicitly discuss diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, the answer is that data augmentation is used to address data bias, but it is unclear if other techniques are used as well.
