Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training of ResNet152V2 on CPU hardware, the use of ResNet50 and ResNet18 in various studies, and the computational resources used for training and testing. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
