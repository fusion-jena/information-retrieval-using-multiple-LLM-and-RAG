Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the R function "optim" is used to maximize the likelihood function of state space models to estimate unknown parameters a, b, c, and Ïƒ2 for each rabbit population. However, it does not specify the optimization method used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
