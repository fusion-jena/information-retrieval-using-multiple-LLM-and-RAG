Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the methodology of the proposed work, which includes data gathering, preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment, but it does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed. It does not mention model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
