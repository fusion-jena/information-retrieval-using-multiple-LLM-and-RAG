Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model for plant species identification. It discusses the model's layers, activation functions, and hyperparameters but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular model.
