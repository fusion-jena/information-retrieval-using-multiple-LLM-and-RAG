Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and integrated SDMs, which involve combining different types of data to model species distributions. It mentions various techniques, such as factor interactions, convolutional neural networks, and co-occurrences, but these are not related to data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
