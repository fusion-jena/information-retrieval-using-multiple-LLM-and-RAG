Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of word embeddings, specifically Word2vec and LSA, for semantic analysis and mentions their applications in various tasks. It does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the LSA model has been demonstrated to generate high-quality performance with dense word vectors and produce the best results regarding semantic similarity tasks. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to capture semantic relationships between words, but the specific metrics used for evaluation are not specified.

In general, the choice of evaluation metrics depends on the specific task and problem being addressed. Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error, among others. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this particular context.
