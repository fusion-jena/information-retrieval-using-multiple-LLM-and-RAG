Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Deneu et al. (2022) used a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution, but it does not specify the framework used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
