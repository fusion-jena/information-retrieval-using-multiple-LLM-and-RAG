Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some hyperparameters that can be related to regularization, such as alpha (L1 and L2 regularization) in MLP, alpha in SVR, reg_alpha in XGB, and C in SVR. These hyperparameters can be used to control the strength of regularization in the respective models. Additionally, the context does not mention dropout as a regularization method. It primarily focuses on traditional machine learning models and their hyperparameters, rather than deep learning pipelines.
