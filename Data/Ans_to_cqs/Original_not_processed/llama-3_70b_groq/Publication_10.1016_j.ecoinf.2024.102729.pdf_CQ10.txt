Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various methods and techniques used in environmental science and machine learning, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
