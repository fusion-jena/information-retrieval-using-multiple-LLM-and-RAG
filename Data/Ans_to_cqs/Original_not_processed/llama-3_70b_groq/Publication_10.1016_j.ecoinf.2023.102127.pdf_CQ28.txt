Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the package ibis.iSDM, which supports various engines for inferring or projecting relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. The engines mentioned are related to regression and machine learning approaches, but there is no mention of deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform.
