Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on machine learning methods for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forests using remote sensing data, including LiDAR and Landsat imagery. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, such as AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression, but does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
