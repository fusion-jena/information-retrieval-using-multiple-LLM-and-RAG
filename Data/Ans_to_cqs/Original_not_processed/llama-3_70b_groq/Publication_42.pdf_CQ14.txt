Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that different hyperparameters were adjusted and 64 architectures were trained, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
