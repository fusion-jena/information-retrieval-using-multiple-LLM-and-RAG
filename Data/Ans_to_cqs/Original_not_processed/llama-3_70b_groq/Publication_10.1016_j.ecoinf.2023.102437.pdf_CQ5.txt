Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics like land cover/land use classification, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, and ENSO forecasting using various machine learning and deep learning models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. However, it does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
