Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through bulk-sample images from high-throughput biodiversity surveys. Specifically, the images are taken from bulk samples of Coleoptera (beetles) collected in different sites around the world. The images are captured using a conventional stereoscope NIKON SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera (5.9 megapixels) controlled by the NIKON DS-L4 v.1.5.0.3 control unit. These images are denoted as the Local Low Quality (LL) dataset.

It does not appear that surveys, sensors, or public datasets are utilized for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline. Instead, the data is collected through a more traditional approach of photographing bulk samples of insects using a microscope camera.
