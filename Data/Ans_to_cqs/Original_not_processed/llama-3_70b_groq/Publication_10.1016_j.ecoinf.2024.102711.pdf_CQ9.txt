Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses various topics such as the limitations of the dataset, hyperparameter tuning, automated machine learning (AutoML), and generative adversarial networks (GANs), but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
