Answer:::

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically bagging and Random Forest, and their application to geospatial modeling. It discusses issues related to biased model training and validation, and proposes a method to correct for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using residual spatial autocorrelation information.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
