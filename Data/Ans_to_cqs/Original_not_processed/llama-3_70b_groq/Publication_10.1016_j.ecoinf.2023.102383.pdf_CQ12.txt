Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of ResNet152, ResNet18, and ResNet34, which are all variants of CNN architectures. Additionally, the text mentions FPN (Feature Pyramid Network), which is a component often used in CNN-based object detection models. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer architectures in the provided context.
