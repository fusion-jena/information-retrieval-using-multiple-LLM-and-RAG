Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on monitoring wildlife using camera trap images and object detection algorithms, as well as discussing the performance of various models in bird recognition tasks.

However, it does mention the issue of dataset noise and its impact on the algorithm's performance in identifying specific bird species. It suggests that dataset noise can arise from various reasons such as vandalism, animal damage, loss of power, or extreme weather, and that it can be difficult to avoid.

While the context does not provide specific techniques to address data bias, it implies the importance of considering data quality and potential sources of noise when working with real-world datasets. It does not mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in the context of the provided research, as it is not mentioned in the given text.
