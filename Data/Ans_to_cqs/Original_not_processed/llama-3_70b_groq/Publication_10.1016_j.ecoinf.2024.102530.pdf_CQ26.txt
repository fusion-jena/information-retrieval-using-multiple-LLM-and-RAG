Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for evaluating the suitability of landscapes for honey bees, and it discusses the use of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions, fuzzy sets, and data sources such as land use/land cover maps, weather data, and parcel data. There is no mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
