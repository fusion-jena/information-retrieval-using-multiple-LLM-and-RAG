Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text discusses the workflow, challenges, and goals of the study, but it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
