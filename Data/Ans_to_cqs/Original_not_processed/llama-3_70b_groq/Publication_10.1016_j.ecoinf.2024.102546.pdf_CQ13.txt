Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are provided in Table 2 of the context. Specifically, the hyperparameters for the three detection models (YOLOX, YOLOv8, and I3Net) are as follows:

* Initial learning rate: 0.01 for YOLOX and YOLOv8, and 0.001 for I3Net (with a reinitialization to 0.01 later in training)
* Learning rate schedule: Warm up + cosine decay for all models
* NMS threshold: 0.45 for YOLOX, 0.7 for YOLOv8, and not specified for I3Net
* Confidence threshold: 0.25 for YOLOX and YOLOv8, and not specified for I3Net
* Weight decay: 0.0005 for all models
* Image size: 800 for all models
* Batch size: 8 for all models
* Optimizer: SGD for all models
* Classification loss: BCE for all models
* Location loss: IoU for all models
* Data augmentation: Color jitter + mosaic for all models, with additional augmentations (VFL, DFL, and CIoU) for YOLOX and YOLOv8.

Note that some hyperparameters are not specified for I3Net, as they may be specific to the domain adaptation task or not relevant for the particular experiment.
