Answer: 

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses citizen science programs, data quality issues, and methods to mitigate reporting bias in marine species observations. It does not mention deep learning pipelines or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The context focuses on addressing data quality issues in citizen science programs, specifically in the context of marine species observations. It discusses techniques such as using a checklist of conspicuous species, having a dive guide or staff member conduct interviews and validate species sightings, and leveraging the knowledge and experience of dive guides to improve data quality.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
