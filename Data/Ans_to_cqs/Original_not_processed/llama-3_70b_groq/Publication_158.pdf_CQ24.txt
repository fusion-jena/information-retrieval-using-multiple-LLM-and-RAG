Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some techniques that can help mitigate the effects of randomness.

One such technique is the use of an ensemble of models. In the context, it is mentioned that an ensemble of three models was generated, and the average of the final output layer was taken. This can help reduce the variability in the results caused by random weight initialization and random selection for batch training.

Another technique mentioned is the use of data augmentation, which can help increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, reflectance bias, and random noise were applied to enhance sample variation.

While these techniques can help reduce the impact of randomness, they do not explicitly address the issue of setting a random seed value. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether a random seed value was set or not.
