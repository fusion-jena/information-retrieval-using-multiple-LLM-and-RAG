The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, according to the context, the dataset used is a custom dataset of endemic bird species images, which is randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing.
