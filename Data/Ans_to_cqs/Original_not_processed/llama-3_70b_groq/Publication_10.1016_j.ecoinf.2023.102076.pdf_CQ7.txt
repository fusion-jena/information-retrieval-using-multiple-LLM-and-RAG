Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text explains how the data was preprocessed, tokenized, and chunked, but it does not specify how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it can be inferred that the data was split in some way, as the text mentions "training, development and testing sets" being selected for the next classification task. Additionally, Table 2 compares the performance of a classification task when trained and tested with either stratified or non-stratified social media datasets, implying that some form of data splitting was done.

Unfortunately, the exact criteria used for splitting the data are not provided in the given context.
