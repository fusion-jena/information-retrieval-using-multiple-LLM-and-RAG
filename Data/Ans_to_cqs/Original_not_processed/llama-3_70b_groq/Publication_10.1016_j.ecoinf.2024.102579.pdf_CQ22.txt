Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to be discussing estimators for diversity indices in forest inventories, specifically the inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators. The performance of these estimators is evaluated using the relative root mean square error (rRMSE). Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
