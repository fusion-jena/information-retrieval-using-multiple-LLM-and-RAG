Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on various statistical and machine learning techniques, including SVM, PLSR, and RF, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
