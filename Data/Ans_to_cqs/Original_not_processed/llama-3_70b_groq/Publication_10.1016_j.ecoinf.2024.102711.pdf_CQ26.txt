Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is generating synthetic data records to enlarge the input dataset and address imbalance issues. This approach is mentioned as a way to improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models by increasing both the quantity and quality of the original real-world datasets.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. It is possible that these techniques may be used in other contexts or studies, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of addressing imbalance issues in datasets, particularly for classifier models, and that generating synthetic data records can help to improve model performance. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
