Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be a list of academic references and a brief description of a mathematical model for learning behavior in paradise fish. There is no mention of deep learning, random seed values, or strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
