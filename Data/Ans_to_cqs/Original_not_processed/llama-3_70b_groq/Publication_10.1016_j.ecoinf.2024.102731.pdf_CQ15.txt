Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to urban planning, ecology, and habitat suitability, with references to papers on topics such as the Spanish housing bubble, wild rabbit conservation, and habitat factors. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
