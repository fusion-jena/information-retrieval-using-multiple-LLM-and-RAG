Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some information from Table 1.

According to Table 1, the splitting of the GBIFm dataset is approximately 20% for validation and 80% for training. Similarly, the splitting of the TLm dataset is approximately 16% for validation and 84% for training. This suggests that the data is split randomly into training and validation sets, with a certain percentage allocated to each set. However, the exact criteria or method used for this random splitting are not specified.

It's worth noting that there is no mention of a test set in the provided context. Typically, in deep learning model training, the data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after training is complete.

In this case, it appears that the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, but it's unclear whether a separate test set is used for final evaluation.
