Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to acoustic entropy indices, signal processing, and ecological monitoring, with references to papers on these topics. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
