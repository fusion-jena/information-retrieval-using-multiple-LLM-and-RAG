Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context primarily focuses on presenting the results of various algorithms and their performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. It also discusses the architecture of the models, including the use of pooling operators, LRN, and the number of layers. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization techniques used, such as grid search, random search, or other methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
