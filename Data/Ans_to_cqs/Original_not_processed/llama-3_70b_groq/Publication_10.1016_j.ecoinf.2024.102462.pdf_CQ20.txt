Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the process of training a deep learning model, the importance of annotated data, and the evaluation of the model on independent datasets. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
