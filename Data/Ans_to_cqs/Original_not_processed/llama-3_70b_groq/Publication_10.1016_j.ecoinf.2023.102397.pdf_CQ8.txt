Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON) platform, which is an online open-source platform, but it does not provide information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the platform. It also mentions various research papers and tools, such as Random Forest and R package monitoR, but it does not provide information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
