Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model is evaluated on multiple datasets, including focal and citizen-science datasets, which might contribute to its generalizability. Additionally, the use of transfer learning models, such as BirdNet-1, which are pre-trained on large datasets, might also help in improving the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. The context primarily focuses on the active learning experiments and the sampling strategies used, rather than the evaluation or training procedures that might affect generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
