Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was collected, comprising 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species of leaves. The dataset was collected using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and to develop a flexible solution that can work in real-world conditions. 

Additionally, the data distribution was split into 70.12% for training, 1.69% for validation, and 28.19% for testing. This split helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique where the model is trained and evaluated on multiple subsets of the data to ensure that the results are not biased towards a particular subset. Stratified splitting is a technique where the data is split in a way that maintains the same proportion of classes in each subset. 

In this case, the model's performance was evaluated on three different sets: raw, pre-processed, and swapped testing sets. The swapped testing sets were used to evaluate the model's performance when the testing set is swapped between the raw and pre-processed datasets. This helps to evaluate the model's robustness to different data distributions.
