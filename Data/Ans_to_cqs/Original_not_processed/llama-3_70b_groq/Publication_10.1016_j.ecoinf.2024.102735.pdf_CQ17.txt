Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning models such as random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression for predicting algal-related parameters, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning.

However, it does mention the regularization parameter (C) in the context of support vector regression, which controls the penalty for margin violation. This is not directly related to deep learning, but it is a regularization technique used in support vector machines.

In the absence of specific information on deep learning regularization methods, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query. I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
