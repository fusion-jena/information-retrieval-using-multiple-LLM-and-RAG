Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization of a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. It does not mention the use of deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that the study employed some form of hyperparameter tuning, which might have involved techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV suggests that the study might have used some form of resampling technique, but the specific details are not provided.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. The study seems to focus on optimizing the RF algorithm's performance on a specific dataset, but the details of the dataset and the splitting strategy are not provided.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
