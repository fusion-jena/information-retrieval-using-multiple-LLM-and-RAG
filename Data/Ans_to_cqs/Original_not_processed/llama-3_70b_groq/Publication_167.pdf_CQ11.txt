Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and components of the pipeline, including the data preprocessing, deep learning module, and simulation module, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
