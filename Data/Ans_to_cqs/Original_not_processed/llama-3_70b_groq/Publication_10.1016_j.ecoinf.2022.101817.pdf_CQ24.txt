Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of repeated random sub-sampling to generate five different data sets (see Fig. 4 (2)) and the random selection of frames from each video using a uniform distribution. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data preparation phase, but it is not clear how it is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does not provide information on whether a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of the results or if other strategies, such as shuffling the data, are employed to handle randomness. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
