Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only discusses the preprocessing of the satellite data, the splitting of the data into training, validation, and test sets, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter tuning process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
