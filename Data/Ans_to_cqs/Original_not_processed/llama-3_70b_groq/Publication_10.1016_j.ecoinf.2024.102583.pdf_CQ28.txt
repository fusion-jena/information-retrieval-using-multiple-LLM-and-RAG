Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any platform, nor does it mention any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be focused on landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, but it does not provide information about the deployment of these models on any specific platform.
