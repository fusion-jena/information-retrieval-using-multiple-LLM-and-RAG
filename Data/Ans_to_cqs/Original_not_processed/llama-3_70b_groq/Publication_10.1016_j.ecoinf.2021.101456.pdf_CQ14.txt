Answer: The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model parameters were tuned on an independent dataset, collected with the identical instrumentation but at a different location, and the values of the hyperparameters [a, b, w1, w2, w3, w4] were found to be sufficiently robust on the dataset used in this work without any fine-tuning. It does not provide information on the optimization method used to find these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
