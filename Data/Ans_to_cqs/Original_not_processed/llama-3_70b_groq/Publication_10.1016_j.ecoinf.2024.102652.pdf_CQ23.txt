Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, network architecture, and experimental design, but it does not discuss the dataset characteristics, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

It is possible that the authors may have used a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the available information.
