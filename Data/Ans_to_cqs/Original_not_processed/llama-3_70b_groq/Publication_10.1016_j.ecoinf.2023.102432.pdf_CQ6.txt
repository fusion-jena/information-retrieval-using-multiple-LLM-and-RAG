Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily discusses the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches in handling imperfect data and introduces MTMI-SMF as a solution that can work with imperfect data. It highlights the advantages of MTMI-SMF, including its ability to group pixels surrounding a training location and its computational efficiency.

The context does not provide information on preprocessing steps, which are typically essential in preparing data for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
