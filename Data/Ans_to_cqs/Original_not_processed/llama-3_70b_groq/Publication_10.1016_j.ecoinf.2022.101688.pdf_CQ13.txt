Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context discusses the pre-processing hyperparameters for each dataset, such as low pass filter cut off, downsampling rate, Nyquist rate, segment duration, and number of testing files. It also mentions the use of pre-trained CNN feature extractors, such as ResNet50, and the addition of softmax output layers. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
