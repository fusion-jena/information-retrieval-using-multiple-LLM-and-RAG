Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various fields, including ecology, image processing, and deep learning, but it does not provide a direct answer to this specific question.

However, in general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as:

1. Fixing the random seed: This ensures reproducibility of results by setting the random seed to a fixed value.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness to random variations.
3. Ensemble methods: Averaging the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds can help reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Carefully tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, can help mitigate the effects of randomness.

These strategies are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
