Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the limitations of building datasets from scratch, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation to overcome these limitations, and references various research papers on object detection and image processing. 

However, it is worth noting that data augmentation is mentioned as a technique to increase the volume of the training dataset artificially, which involves applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. These transformations can be considered as a form of preprocessing, but the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps.

In general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature extraction, and data transformation, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
