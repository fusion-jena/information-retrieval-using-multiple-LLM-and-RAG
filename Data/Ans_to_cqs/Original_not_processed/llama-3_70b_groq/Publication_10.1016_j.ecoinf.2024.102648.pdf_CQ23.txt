Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well as different testing and training data sets. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or data splitting may have been used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "multiyear multilocation data", which could imply that the dataset is diverse and covers different locations and years, which can help improve the model's generalizability. However, without more specific information, it is unclear what exact measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
