Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers and tools related to deep learning, machine learning, and event-stream processing. There is no mention of a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
