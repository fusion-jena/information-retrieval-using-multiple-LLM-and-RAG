Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the performance of different deep learning models for bird object detection, the dataset used, and the potential benefits of using deep learning-based approaches for wildlife monitoring. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
