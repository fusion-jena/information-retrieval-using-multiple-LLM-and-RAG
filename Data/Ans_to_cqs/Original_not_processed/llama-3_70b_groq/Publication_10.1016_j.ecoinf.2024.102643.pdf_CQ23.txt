Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The context mentions the use of 10 different algorithms, including Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and others, but it does not specifically mention a deep learning model. 

However, the context does mention that the ensemble model was constructed by weight averaging the predictions from the 10 different algorithms, and that the predictions were averaged across three replicated runs for each model. This suggests that some form of model averaging or ensemble method was used to improve the generalizability of the model. 

Additionally, the context does not mention the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model. It only mentions that the ensemble model was constructed by combining the predictions from multiple models, which can help to improve the robustness of the results.
