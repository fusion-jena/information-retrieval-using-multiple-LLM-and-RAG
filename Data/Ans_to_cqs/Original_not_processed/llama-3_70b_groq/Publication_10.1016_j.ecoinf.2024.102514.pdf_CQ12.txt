Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model being used in a pipeline. The context appears to be discussing various machine learning models and techniques, including cross-validation, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model being used. The table provided shows a ranking of models based on various statistical measures, but it does not specify the type of models being referred to. The models listed, such as EN, GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB, are not deep learning models, but rather traditional machine learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
