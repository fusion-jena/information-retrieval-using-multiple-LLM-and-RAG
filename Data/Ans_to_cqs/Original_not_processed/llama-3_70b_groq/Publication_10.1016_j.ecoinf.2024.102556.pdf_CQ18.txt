Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, its components, and the comparison of different models (YOLOv7, SORT, and Deep SORT) for object tracking and detection. It discusses the advantages of using YOLOv7 and the benefits of integrating FENs with Deep SORT. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
