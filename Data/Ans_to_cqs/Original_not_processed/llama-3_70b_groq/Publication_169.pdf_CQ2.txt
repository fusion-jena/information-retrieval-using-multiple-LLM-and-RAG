Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically leaf images. This is evident from the mention of image recognition applications, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the use of data augmentation to extract deep features from the images. The context also mentions the classification of plant species images into 100 categories, further supporting the use of image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
