Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the CNN model requires equally sized input images, and a time-frequency input window size of 2 s was chosen for preprocessing the training data. This suggests that some form of resizing or cropping of the input data may have been performed, but the exact details are not provided.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset. This implies that the model may have been designed to work with certain types of input data, but the specific preprocessing steps used for the target call type data are not described.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
