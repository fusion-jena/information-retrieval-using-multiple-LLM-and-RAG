Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is maintaining consistent ratios across groups in the sampling process. This is mentioned in Table 3, which suggests that different samples are present across groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

It can be inferred that the authors have taken care to ensure that the sampling process is unbiased, but the exact technique used is not specified. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that any of the mentioned techniques (stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection) are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
