Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and soil moisture estimation, using PlanetScope satellite imagery and topographic indices. There is a mention of potentially using machine learning or deep neural networks in the future to improve the accuracy of soil moisture prediction, but no specific datasets are mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
