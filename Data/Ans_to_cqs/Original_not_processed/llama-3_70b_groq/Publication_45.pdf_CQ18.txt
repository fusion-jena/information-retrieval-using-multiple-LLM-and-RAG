Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to split the available data into a training data set and a test data set. The model is trained on the training data set, and its performance is evaluated on the test data set. The training of the individual candidate networks is stopped when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset does not increase further. This approach allows for gauging the accuracy of predictions for new input data (i.e., data not used during training) and prevents overfitting.
