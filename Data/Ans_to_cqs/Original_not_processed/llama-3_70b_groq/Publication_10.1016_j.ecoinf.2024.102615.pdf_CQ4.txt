Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the neural network, including the input layer, hidden layer, batch normalization layer, and dropout layer, as well as the application of machine learning algorithms to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers. It also references various studies and papers related to neural networks, remote sensing, and deep learning techniques, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
