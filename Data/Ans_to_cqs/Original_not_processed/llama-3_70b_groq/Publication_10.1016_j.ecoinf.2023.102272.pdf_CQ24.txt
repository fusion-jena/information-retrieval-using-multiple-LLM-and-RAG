Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different deep learning models, model selection procedures, and their applications.

However, it is worth noting that the model selection procedure involves randomly generating 5 models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types, which might introduce some randomness in the pipeline. Additionally, the training process involves training each model with a small subset of the training data for 4 epochs, which could also introduce some randomness.

Despite this, there is no explicit mention of strategies to handle randomness, such as setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques like dropout or batch normalization, or employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
