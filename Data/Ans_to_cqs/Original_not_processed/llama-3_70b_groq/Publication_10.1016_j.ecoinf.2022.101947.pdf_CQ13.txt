Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers and leopards, and it discusses classification models and algorithms, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
