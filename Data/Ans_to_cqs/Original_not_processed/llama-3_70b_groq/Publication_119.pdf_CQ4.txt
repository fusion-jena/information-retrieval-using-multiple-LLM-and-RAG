Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of different machine learning models, including U-Net, SVM, and DNN, and their hyperparameter tuning for image classification tasks. It discusses the importance of pretraining, batch normalization, and dropout layers in improving model performance but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
