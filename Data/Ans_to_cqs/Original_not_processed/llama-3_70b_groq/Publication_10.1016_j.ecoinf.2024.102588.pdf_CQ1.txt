Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and autoencoders, to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. It discusses the potential of deep learning techniques in processing multidimensional data and their successful applications in various fields, including water quality, streamflow, and algae estimation.

However, it does mention the use of ecological monitoring data for calculating the TDI, BMI, and FAI indices, but it does not provide information on how this data was collected. It also references various studies that have applied deep learning algorithms to different datasets, but it does not elaborate on the data collection methods used in those studies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
