Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model, hyperparameters, learning rate, or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing fire severity, combustion efficiency, and dataset validation, with units of measurement in tons per hectare and Tg (tera grams). There is no mention of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
