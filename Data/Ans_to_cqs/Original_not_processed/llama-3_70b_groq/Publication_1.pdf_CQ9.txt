Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions a conference paper and provides a DOI, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Additionally, it mentions a link to a ResearchGate publication, but it does not provide information about a data repository either. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
