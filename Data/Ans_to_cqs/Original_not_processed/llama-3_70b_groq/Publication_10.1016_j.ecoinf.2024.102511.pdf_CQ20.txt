Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text discusses the application of deep learning methods to bioacoustic classification, the potential of neural networks for large datasets, and the need for significant sample sizes for all classes. It also mentions the development of more user-friendly tools for applying and testing neural network classification methods. However, it does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training these models.
