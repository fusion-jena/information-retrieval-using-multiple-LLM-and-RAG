Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be focused on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in various fields such as bioinformatics, ecology, and environmental engineering, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a specific model on a cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
