Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline involves the use of remote sensing datasets, specifically satellite or aerial imagery. The context mentions "Spectral bands (B)", "Vegetation Indices (VI)", "Soil Indices (SI)", and "Water Indices (WI)", which are typical features extracted from remote sensing data. Additionally, the presence of "Dataset 1" to "Dataset 31" suggests that multiple datasets are being used.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors as data collection methods. It is also unclear whether public datasets are being used, although the presence of multiple datasets suggests that they might be.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on the data collection method, and the answer is inferred based on the features and datasets mentioned.
