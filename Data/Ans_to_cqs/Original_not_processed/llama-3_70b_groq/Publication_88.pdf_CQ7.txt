Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon and Cerrado databases.

From Table 1, we can see that the training set for the Amazon database consists of tiles 1, 7, 9, and 13, with a total of 78,431 samples. The validation set consists of tiles 5 and 12, with a total of 39,697 samples. The test set consists of tiles 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15, with a total of 1,675,608 samples.

Similarly, Table 2 provides the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Cerrado database. However, the criteria used to split the data into these sets are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
