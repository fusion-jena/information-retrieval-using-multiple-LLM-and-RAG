Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text focuses on the calibration of the TensorFlow model for Mexican and Brazilian species, the adjustment of parameters such as validation percentage and number of training steps, and the evaluation of the model's performance based on correct identification rate and processing time. However, it does not provide information on whether a diverse dataset was used, cross-validation was performed, or stratified splitting was employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
