Answer:::
The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods specifically used to prevent overfitting in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses species distribution models (SDMs) and regularization techniques used in GLM, GAM, and RF algorithms to prevent overfitting. 

The regularization methods mentioned in the context are:

* Elastic net regularization (used in GLM)
* Null-space penalization (used in GAM)
* Guided regularization (used in RF)

These regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting in the SDM context, but they are not specifically related to deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not addressed in the provided context.
