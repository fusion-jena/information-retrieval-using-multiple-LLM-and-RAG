Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that 70% of the samples were used for training and 30% for testing, which suggests that the authors used a train-test split to evaluate the model's performance. 

Additionally, the context mentions that an additional accuracy assessment using validation points was conducted, which implies that the authors used some form of validation or cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, the exact details of the validation strategy are not provided.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
