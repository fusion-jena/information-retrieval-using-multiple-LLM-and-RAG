Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is segmentation. Specifically, it is used for land cover classification, particularly for mapping wetland classes as defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System. The deep learning model used is a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of segmentation CNN originally developed for biomedical image segmentation. The model takes in various inputs, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data, and outputs a classified map of wetland classes.
