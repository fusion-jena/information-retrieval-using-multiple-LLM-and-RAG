Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any hyperparameters associated with it. The text discusses the development of a spatial modeling approach for estimating VWC on reclaimed spoil heap using remote sensing data and topographic indices, and the evaluation of the model's accuracy using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks being used in the model. The text does suggest that testing machine learning or deep neural networks could be a worthwhile approach for future research, but it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in such a model.
