Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It appears to discuss a Random Forest (RF) model. Therefore, I will answer the query based on the RF model.

To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, the following measures were taken:

1. **Random splitting of data**: The training samples were randomly divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

2. **Five-fold cross-validation**: A grid search method (GridSearchCV) was used with five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the model. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.

3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: The hyperparameters of the RF model, such as the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features), were tuned using a grid search method. This helps to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that generalize well to new data.

However, it is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
