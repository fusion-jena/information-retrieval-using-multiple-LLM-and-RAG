Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned as a deep learning model in the provided context. However, a random forest (RF) binary classification model is mentioned, which is used to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation. The model is used to perform a per-pixel analysis of all NAIP scenes from 2020 over this region. Therefore, the purpose of the RF model is classification, specifically binary classification to identify iceplant.
