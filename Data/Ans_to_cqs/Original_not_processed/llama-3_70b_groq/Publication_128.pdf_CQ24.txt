Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, model training, and evaluation of deep learning approaches for plant image classification. It discusses the input data resolution, batch normalization, batch size, activation functions, learning rate, dropout rate, and training epochs, but does not address randomness or random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
