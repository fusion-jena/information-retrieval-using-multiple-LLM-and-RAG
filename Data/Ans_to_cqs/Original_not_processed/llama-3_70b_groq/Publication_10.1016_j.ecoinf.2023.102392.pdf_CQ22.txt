Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1, overall accuracy (OA), and Kappa. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the land use/land cover classification accuracy and the accuracy of forest types in the study site using XGBoost. 

Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Overall accuracy (OA) is the ratio of correctly classified points to the total number of points examined. Kappa is a measure of inter-rater agreement or accuracy, which takes into account the possibility of the correct classification occurring by chance.
