Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context only discusses the configuration of the Random Forest (RF) model and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, including the parameters used for training. It does not provide information on what happens after the models are trained, such as calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, or generating saliency maps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
