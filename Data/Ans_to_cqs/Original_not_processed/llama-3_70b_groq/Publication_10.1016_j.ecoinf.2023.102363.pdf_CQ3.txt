Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the use of EfficientNet B0 network for image classification, transfer learning, and fine-tuning the fully connected layers for classifying PAM data frames into sound source classes. It also mentions the use of spectrograms as image input, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
