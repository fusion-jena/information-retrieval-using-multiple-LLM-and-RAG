Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of a multiple-instance learning algorithm to detect an invasive plant species using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery, and compares the results with a random forest approach. It also provides references to various studies and papers related to machine learning and remote sensing, but does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
