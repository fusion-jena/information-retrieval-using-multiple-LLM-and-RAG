Answer: 

According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models are accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss. The accuracy metric is used to measure the proportion of correctly classified instances, and the binary cross-entropy loss metric is used to measure the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a formula to calculate accuracy, which is A = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, respectively. 

However, it does not mention the use of precision and recall metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.
