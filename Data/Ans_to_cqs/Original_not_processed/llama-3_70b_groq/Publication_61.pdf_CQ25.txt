Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is primarily for image classification, specifically for plant recognition and identification. The models are trained to classify images of plants into different species, such as legume species (white bean, red bean, and soybean) or cactus recognition in aerial images. Additionally, the models are also used for object detection, such as facial key-point detection, and image captioning. Furthermore, the models are used for disease detection in plants, which can be considered as a form of anomaly detection.
