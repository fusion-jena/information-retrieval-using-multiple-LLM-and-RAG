Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data, but it does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
