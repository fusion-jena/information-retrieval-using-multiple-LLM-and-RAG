Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors performed a sensitivity study by training models using different proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total hand-annotations) and reran the experiment five times to account for the random subsampling of annotations. This suggests that the authors monitored the model performance by evaluating the model's accuracy or other performance metrics at different stages of training with varying amounts of training data. The results of this study are presented in Figure 7, which shows the ablation curves of the proportion of hand-annotation training data for each site.
