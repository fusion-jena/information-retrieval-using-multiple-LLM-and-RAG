Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, modeling approach, evaluation metrics, and the inferencing pipeline. It discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library, but it does not provide information on how data bias is handled.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors may have addressed data bias in their study, but this information is not included in the provided sections.
