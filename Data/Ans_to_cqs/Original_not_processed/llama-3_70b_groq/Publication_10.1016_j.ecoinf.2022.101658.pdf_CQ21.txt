Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of collecting field measurements, manual classification of fuel types, and the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
