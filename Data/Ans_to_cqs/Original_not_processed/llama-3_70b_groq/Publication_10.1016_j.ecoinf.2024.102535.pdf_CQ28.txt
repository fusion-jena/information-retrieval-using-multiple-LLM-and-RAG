Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation of deep learning architectures for deep-sea substratum characterization, the architecture details of the classifiers, and the experimental results. There is no mention of the deployment platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
