Answer:::
The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including CNN and attention mechanisms. Specifically, the baseline model is based on the Xception network, which is a type of CNN architecture. Additionally, the model incorporates a positional attention mechanism, which is commonly used in transformer models. However, it does not appear to use a traditional transformer architecture. The model also does not use RNNs, such as LSTMs, which are typically used for sequential data. Instead, the attention mechanism is used to focus on specific parts of the input data.
