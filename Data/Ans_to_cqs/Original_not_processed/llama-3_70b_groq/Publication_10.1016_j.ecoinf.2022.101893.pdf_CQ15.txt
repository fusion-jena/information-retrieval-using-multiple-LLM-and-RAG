Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, feature extraction, and classification results. It discusses the use of convolution kernel pooling layers, fully connected layers, dropout layers, and dense layers, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
