Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to bat calls detection and classification, statistical computing, and geographic information systems, but it does not provide information on deep learning regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
