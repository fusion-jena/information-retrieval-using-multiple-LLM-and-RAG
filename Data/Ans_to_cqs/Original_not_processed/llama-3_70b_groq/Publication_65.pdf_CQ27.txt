Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the implementation, evaluation, and comparison of different deep learning-based models for a specific task, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

The context mentions the use of TensorFlow as the Python framework for implementing the deep learning models, and it provides details on the experimental setup, including the hardware and software used. However, it does not discuss model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspects of model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
