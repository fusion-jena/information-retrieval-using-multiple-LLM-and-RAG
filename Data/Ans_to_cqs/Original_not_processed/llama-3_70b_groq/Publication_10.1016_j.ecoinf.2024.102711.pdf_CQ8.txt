Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline, including AutoGluon. It only provides information about the functionality and features of AutoGluon, its approach to machine learning, and its comparison with other AutoML models like TabPFN. There is no mention of a specific code repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
