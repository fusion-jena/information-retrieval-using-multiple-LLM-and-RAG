Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that future studies could evaluate the feasibility of using more sophisticated methods for automated cattle detection, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or deep learning. However, it does not specify which type of model is currently being used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
