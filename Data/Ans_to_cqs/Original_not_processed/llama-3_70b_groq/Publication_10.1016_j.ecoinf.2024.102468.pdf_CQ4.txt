Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing the performance of a WT-HMM (Wavelet-Transform Hidden Markov Model) technique with varying dataset sizes and its comparison with other studies. It also references some papers on feature extraction, bird diversity monitoring, and complex systems, but none of these mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
