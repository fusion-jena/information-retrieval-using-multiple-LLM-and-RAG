Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it is mentioned that "Data augmentation: x12" is used, which suggests that the dataset is augmented 12 times to increase its size and diversity. This technique can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness to different types of data.

However, it does not appear that other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are explicitly mentioned in the context. Additionally, there is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, the answer is that data augmentation is used to address data bias, but it is not clear if other techniques are used as well.
