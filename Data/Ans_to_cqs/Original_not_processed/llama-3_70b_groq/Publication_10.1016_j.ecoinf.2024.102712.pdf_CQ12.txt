Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) being used in a pipeline. The context appears to be related to forestry, remote sensing, and geospatial data, with references to various research papers, reports, and datasets. However, it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
