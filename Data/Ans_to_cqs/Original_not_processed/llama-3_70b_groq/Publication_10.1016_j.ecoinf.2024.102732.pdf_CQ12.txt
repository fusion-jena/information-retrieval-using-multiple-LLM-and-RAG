Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context mentions machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest (RF), and Linear Regression, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
