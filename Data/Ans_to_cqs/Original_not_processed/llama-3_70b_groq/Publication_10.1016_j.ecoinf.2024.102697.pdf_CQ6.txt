Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on machine learning methods, specifically random forest, and discusses hyperparameter optimization, model development, and model complexity. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically associated with deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
