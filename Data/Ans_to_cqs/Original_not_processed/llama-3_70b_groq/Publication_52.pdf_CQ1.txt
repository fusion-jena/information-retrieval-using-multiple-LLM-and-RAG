Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of extreme deep learning in biosecurity, specifically for marine species identification, and discusses the use of machine hearing and extreme learning machines (ELMs) for analyzing big data. It does not provide information on the data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
