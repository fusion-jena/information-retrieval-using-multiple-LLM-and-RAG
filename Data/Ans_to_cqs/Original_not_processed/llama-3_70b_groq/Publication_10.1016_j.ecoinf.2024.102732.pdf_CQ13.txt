Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context discusses XGBoost, SVR, and Random Forest models, but not deep learning models. It mentions hyperparameters such as "nrounds", "max depth", "min child weight", "gamma", and "subsample" for XGBoost, and "ntree" and "mtry" for Random Forest, but not hyperparameters specific to deep learning models like learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
