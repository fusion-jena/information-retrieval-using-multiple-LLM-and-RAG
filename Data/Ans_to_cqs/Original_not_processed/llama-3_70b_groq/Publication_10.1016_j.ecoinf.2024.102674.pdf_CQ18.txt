Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model performance, as mentioned in Fig. A.10, which shows the seasonal patterns in KGE scores, pbias, MAE, and RMSE obtained in the cross-validations. This suggests that the model performance was monitored during training using cross-validation, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance are not clearly stated.
