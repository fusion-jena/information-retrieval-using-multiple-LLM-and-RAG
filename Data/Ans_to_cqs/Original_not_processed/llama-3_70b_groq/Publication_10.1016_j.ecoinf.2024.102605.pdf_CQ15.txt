Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of a 1D-CNN (one-dimensional convolutional neural network) algorithm for pest damage identification and the analysis of spectral vegetation indices. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train the CNN model.
