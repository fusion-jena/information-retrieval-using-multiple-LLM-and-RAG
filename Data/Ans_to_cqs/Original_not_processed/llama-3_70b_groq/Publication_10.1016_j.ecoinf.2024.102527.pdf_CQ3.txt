Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that each image in the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated, but it does not specify the type of annotation. It does not provide any information about the annotation techniques used for the Snapshot Serengeti (SS) and Lasha Mountain (LSM) datasets. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
