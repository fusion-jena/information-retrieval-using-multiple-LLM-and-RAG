Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation (DA) as a technique to quantitatively increase and diversify training data, which can help mitigate data bias. DA involves creating modified copies of a dataset using the existing data, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the network. 

The context also mentions the use of a designed set of data augmentations instead of simple random transformations during data training, which can further improve the generalization ability of the network. Additionally, the proposed FAA-based approach involves dividing the data into five equal folds and applying augmentation policies to each fold without repetition, which can help reduce data bias.

However, the context does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in the context.
