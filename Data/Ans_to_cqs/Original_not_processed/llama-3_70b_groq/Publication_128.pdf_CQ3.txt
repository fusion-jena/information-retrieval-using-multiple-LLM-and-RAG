Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of various deep learning models, including AlexNet and ResNet, and their applications in plant image classification. It discusses the model's layers, activation functions, and training parameters, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
