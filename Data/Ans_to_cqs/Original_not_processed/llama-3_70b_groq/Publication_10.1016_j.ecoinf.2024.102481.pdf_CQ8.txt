Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a scientific article discussing the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forests, to classify maturity in Chilean hake. It provides references to other studies and mentions data availability, but the data is stated to be confidential. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so it is not possible to determine where the code is available.
