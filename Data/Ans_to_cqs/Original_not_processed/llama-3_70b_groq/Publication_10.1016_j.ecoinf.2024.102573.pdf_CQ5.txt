Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses bird species recognition and related tasks, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing the models. It mentions the use of EfficientNet-B0, a pre-trained model, but it does not specify the dataset used for pre-training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
