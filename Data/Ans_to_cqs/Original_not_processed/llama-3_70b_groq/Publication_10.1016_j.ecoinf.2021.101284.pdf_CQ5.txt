Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on COVID-19, air pollution, and geographic conditions, and it mentions the use of deep learning algorithms for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
