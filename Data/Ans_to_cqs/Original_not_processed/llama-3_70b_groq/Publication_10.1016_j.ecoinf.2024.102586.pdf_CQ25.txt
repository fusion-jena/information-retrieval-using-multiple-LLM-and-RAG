Answer:::
The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather a random forest (RF) model. The RF model is used to examine the relative importance of selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance separately. The model is employed to identify the drivers of invasive species diversity, which has implications for guiding invasion management and mitigation measures.
