Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which is a type of machine learning model, but not a deep learning model specifically. The hyperparameters mentioned for the ANN are:

* Size: the number of units in the hidden layer, which was passed as an array of 1-20.
* Decay: the regularization parameter to avoid overfitting, which was passed as an array of 0.025-1.

There is no mention of the learning rate or optimizer in the context. It only mentions that the weights were randomly initialized using the Nguyen-Widrow method.
