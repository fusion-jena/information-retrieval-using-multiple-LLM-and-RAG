Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and techniques used to assess the model's performance.

In the context of the classification problem (Q1), it is mentioned that a cumulative evaluation was performed to measure the model's performance across all transects. This involved calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions.

There is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other postprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps were not performed or were not considered relevant to the specific research question being addressed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
