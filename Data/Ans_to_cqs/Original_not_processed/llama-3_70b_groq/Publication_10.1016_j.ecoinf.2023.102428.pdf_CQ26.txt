Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the research workflow, MLP parameters, and performance, as well as LULC classification and accuracy assessment. It does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "pre-processing of data" in the research workflow, but it does not elaborate on the specific techniques used to handle data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.

If you have any further information or context, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
