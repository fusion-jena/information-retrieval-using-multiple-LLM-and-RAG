Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their applications, but it does not specify the purpose of the ANN model used in this particular study. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the ANN model is used for regression tasks, as the performance metrics mentioned are coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), which are commonly used for evaluating regression models. The study appears to be focused on predicting continuous values for CHL-a, SD, and TSS, but the exact purpose of the model is not explicitly stated.
