Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the batch size was set to 32 to "not exceed the memory limit and to make full use of computer resources", but it does not specify what type of computer resources are being referred to. It could be GPUs, TPUs, or even CPUs, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this.
