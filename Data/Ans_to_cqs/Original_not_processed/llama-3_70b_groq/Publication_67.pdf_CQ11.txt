I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions supplementary materials available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/343/s1, but it does not provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
