Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, its components, and the training process. It discusses the use of the AlexNet architecture, the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, as well as the training parameters such as kernel size, stride, dropout rate, and learning rate. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
