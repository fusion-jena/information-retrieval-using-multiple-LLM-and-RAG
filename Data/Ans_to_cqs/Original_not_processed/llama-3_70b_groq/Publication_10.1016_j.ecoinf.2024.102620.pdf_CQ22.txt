Answer: The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the PLUS model, which is a land use prediction model that employs a random forest algorithm and a cellular automata (CA) model. The context provides information on the validation metrics used to evaluate the performance of the PLUS model, which include the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), RMSE, and MAPE. These metrics are used to assess the credibility and accuracy of the predicted values. However, it does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
