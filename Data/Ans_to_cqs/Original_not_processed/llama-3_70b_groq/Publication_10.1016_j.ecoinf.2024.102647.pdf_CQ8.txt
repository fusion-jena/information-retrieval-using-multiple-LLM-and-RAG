Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide any information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a list of references and some data related to land use and soil salinity, but it does not include any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
