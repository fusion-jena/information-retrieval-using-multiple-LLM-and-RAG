Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the development of various models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models, for generating synthetic data and coral cover models. It also mentions the use of these models for facilitating decision support tool testing and demonstrations. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, including model serialization and platform selection.
