Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil salinity distribution mapping and mentions various variables such as slope, curvature, climate type, land use, and others, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
