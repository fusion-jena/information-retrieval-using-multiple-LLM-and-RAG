Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used for training the model. 

The context mentions the use of satellite images and spectral signatures, but it does not mention popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in image classification tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
