Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors took measures such as preparing a larger dataset and fine-tuning the model for specific data. The model was partially trained to learn the data first, and then it was used to annotate new data before training it further. This approach allowed for the preparation of a large dataset within a day. Additionally, a small dataset containing only images from Kenya was used to fine-tune the model for the Kenyan data, which had lower image quality compared to the other two locations. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other common techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or ensemble methods. The authors do not explicitly mention the diversity of the dataset, but it can be inferred that the dataset is diverse since it includes images from three different locations: Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya.
