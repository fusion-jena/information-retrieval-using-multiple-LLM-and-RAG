Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the Elastic Net is used to solve the overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. This suggests that the authors have taken steps to address overfitting, which is a common issue that can affect the generalizability of a model. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors have used a deep learning model to extract useful features and classify fish from different families, which implies that they have considered the issue of high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not provide further details on how they ensured the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
