Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on deep noise reduction techniques, bioacoustics applications, and the challenges of generating training data for fine-tuning.

However, it can be inferred that the randomness in the deep learning pipeline might be handled through the random sampling of noise from a dataset containing 963 five-second noise samples collated from field recordings. This random sampling is used to generate the noisy input data for training the models.

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is unclear what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness, such as setting random seed values, using techniques like dropout, or other methods.

In summary, while the context touches on random sampling of noise for generating training data, it does not provide explicit information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
