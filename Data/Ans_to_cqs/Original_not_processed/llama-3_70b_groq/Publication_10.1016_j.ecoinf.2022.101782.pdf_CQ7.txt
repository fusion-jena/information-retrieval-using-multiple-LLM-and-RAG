Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions that the model was trained on a dataset, and an independent test set of 2060 images was used to evaluate the model's performance. It does not provide information on how the data was split into training, validation, and testing sets.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets using techniques such as random sampling or stratified sampling to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on representative and independent datasets. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this specific case.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context.
