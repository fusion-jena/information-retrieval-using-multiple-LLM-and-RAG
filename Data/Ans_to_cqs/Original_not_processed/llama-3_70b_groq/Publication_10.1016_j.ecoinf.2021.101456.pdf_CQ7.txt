Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and its application to semi-supervised clustering. It discusses the optimization objective, network architecture, and training details, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information about the dataset and experiment design, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
