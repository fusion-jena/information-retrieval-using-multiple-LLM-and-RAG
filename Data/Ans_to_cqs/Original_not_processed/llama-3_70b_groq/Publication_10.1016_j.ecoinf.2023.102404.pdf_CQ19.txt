Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context discusses the optimization of parameters for a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest (RF) model, and cites various research papers related to remote sensing and machine learning. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
