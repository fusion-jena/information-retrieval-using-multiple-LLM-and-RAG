Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil surveys, soil profile information, and node-based programming, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or data bias mitigation techniques.

The mentioned research papers and articles focus on topics such as soil profile horizon delineation, soil investigation accidents, landscape and soil profile evolution, data exchange schemas, and machine learning techniques for digital soil mapping. However, they do not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
