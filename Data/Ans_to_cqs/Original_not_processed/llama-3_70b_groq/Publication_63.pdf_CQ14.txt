Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the hyperparameters used for the training process, such as the batch size, optimizer, learning rate, and learning rate decay. It does not provide information on whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
