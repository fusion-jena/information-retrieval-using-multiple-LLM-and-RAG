Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data compilation, machine learning ensemble, and model assessment. It discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, model diagnostics, and partial dependence plots, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
