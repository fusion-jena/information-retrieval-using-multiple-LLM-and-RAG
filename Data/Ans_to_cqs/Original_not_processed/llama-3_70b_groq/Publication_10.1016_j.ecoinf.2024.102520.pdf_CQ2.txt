Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and its processing, including geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. It also mentions the use of Digital Number (DN) and Surface Reflectance (SR) images. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
