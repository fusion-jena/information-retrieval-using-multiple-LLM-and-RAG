Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to nighttime light images and geographic data. There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats. However, the context mentions nighttime light images, which suggests that image data formats might be used. Additionally, the context mentions geographic data, such as population simulation, spatial distribution of population, and vegetation continuous field products, which implies that CSV or other tabular data formats might be used to store and process geographic data. 

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and the answer is inferred based on the mentioned data types and applications. If more information about the specific deep learning pipeline is provided, a more accurate answer could be given.
