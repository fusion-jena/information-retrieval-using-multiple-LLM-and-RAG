Answer::: 
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the DeepLabV3+ algorithm, is semantic segmentation. This is stated in the context as "DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation". Semantic segmentation is a task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image, allowing for the identification of objects and their boundaries at the pixel level. In this case, the model is used for land cover classification, where the model predicts the class label for each pixel in the remote sensing images.
