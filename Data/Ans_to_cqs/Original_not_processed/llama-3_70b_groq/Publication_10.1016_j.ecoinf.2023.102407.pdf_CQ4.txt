Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that the teacher model is re-trained using augmented DT (presumably, Decision Trees) and generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, but it does not provide details on the augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
