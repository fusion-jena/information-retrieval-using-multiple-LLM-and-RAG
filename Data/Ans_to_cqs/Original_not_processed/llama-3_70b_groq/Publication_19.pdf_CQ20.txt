Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of Raspberry Pi (RPi) as an edge device for deploying the trained models. It also mentions the use of Keras, a high-level neural networks API, for implementing the models, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
