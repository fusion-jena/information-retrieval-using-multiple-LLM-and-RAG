Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context discusses a supervised learning workflow, but it does not provide information on the specific model used or its evaluation. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors used a stratified approach to ensure the representativeness of their sampling plots. They used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots, which helped to ensure that their training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. 

Additionally, the authors calculated the size of the sampling plots by dividing 5% of the total area covered by the boundary by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary. This approach helped to ensure that the sampling plots were representative of the different vegetation types present in the area.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, diverse datasets, or other measures typically used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
