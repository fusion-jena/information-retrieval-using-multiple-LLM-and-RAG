Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The R package "kohonen" is mentioned as the tool used to implement the SOFM algorithm, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
