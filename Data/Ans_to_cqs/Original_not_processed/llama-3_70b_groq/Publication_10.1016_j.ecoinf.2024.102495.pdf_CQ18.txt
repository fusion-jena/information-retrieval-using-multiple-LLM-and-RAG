Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of running folds. This is evident from Fig. 10, which shows the performance of Model 1 in each running fold of the model training for binary classification. Additionally, Fig. 11 displays a scatterplot of the Model 1's performance on each running fold for binary classification. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated and monitored at each iteration of the training process, allowing for the identification of the most optimal model.

Furthermore, the context also mentions the use of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models and identify the most optimal one. The use of these metrics and the running folds strategy suggests that the model's performance is being closely monitored and evaluated during the training process.
