Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training of the model using different training sets, incremental training mode, and zero-start training mode on a GPU server and a desktop PC. It also discusses the architecture of the DCNN model, which is based on the AlexNet model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
