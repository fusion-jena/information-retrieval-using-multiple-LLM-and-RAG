Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is a mention of "optimizer approach for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters" in the context, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
