Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The engines supported by ibis.iSDM are mentioned, which include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. These are machine learning approaches, but they are not deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
