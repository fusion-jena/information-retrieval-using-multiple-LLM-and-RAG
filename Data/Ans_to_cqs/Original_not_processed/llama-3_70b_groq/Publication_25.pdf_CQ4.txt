Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the lack of large training datasets and the need for innovative approaches to address this limitation. It mentions semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and unsupervised methods to generate training data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
