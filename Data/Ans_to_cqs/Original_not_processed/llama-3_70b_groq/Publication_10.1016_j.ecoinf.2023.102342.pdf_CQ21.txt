Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes steps like identification of the aim, pre-selection of data, analytical determinations, optimization and elaboration of results, mapping and interpretation, display of results, and decision-making.

However, it does mention "optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through statistics" and "mapping and interpretation of the results" as part of the KDD sequence. These steps might involve some form of postprocessing, but the specific techniques mentioned in the query (Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix) are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training.
