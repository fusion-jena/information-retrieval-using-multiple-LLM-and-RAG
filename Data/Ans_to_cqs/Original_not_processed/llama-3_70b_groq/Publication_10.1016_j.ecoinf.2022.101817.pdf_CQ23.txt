Answer::: 

The context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the "cross-validation phase of the designed CNN models" and the generation of "confusion matrices during the cross-validation phase". This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the model and ensure its generalizability. 

Additionally, the context presents the average of confusion matrices of five CNN models, which implies that multiple models were trained and evaluated, possibly with different hyperparameters or architectures. This could be an indication of some form of model ensemble or hyperparameter tuning, which can also contribute to the generalizability of the model.

However, there is no mention of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it can be concluded that cross-validation was used, but the extent of other measures taken to ensure generalizability is unknown.
