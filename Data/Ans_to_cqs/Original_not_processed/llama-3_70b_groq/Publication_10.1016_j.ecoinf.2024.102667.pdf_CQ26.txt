Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research article about vegetation change, climate change, and human activities in China, and it does not mention deep learning pipelines or data preprocessing techniques. The context includes mathematical equations, references to research papers, and keywords related to environmental science, but it does not provide any information about addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context. If you have any further questions or provide more relevant context, I'll be happy to help.
