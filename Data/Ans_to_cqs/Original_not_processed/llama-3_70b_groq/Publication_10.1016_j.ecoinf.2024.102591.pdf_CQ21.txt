Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to wildfire events, vegetation recovery, and remote sensing models (PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL), but it does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved in model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
