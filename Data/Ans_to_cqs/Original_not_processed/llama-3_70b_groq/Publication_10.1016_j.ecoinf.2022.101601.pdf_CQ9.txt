Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The context appears to be related to research papers and articles on topics such as permafrost, soil science, and environmental monitoring, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
