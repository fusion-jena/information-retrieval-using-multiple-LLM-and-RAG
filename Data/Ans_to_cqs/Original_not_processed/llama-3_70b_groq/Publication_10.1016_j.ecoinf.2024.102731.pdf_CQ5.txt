Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to landscape dynamics and habitat suitability analysis, and the datasets mentioned are related to climate data, digital elevation models, roads, lithostratigraphic maps, hunting areas, and landscape metrics. These datasets are used to analyze landscape dynamics and derive a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI). 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
