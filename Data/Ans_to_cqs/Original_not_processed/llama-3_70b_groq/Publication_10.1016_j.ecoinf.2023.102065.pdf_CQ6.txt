Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of mel-spectrograms as input data for the CNN models. Mel-spectrograms are a type of audio representation that has already undergone some preprocessing steps, such as converting audio waveforms into a 2D representation of frequency and time.

In a related study by Knight et al. (2020 May 3), it is mentioned that preprocessing spectrogram parameters can improve the accuracy of bioacoustic classification using convolutional neural networks. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this specific study.
