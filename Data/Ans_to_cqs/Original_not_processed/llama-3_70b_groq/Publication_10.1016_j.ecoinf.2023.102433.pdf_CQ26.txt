Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a web service API for accessing NASA data, discussing data formats, API methods, and references to various research papers. There is no mention of deep learning, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
