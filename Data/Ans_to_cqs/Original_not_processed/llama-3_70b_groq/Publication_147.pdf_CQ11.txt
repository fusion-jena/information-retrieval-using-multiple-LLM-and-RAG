Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are academic papers and publications, but they do not include a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
