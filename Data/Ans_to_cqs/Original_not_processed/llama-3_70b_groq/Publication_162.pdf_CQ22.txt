Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the D-Mask R-CNN architecture, are the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75. These metrics are defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset. AP50 and AP75 denote the average precision at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 50% and 75%, respectively. AP denotes the average precision over IoU thresholds from 50% to 95% in 5% increments. These metrics are used to quantify the results of the D-Mask R-CNN model for bounding box detection and segmentation.
