Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention some postprocessing techniques used to control the duration of detected events, which include:

* Deleting/merging very short events
* Peak picking and thresholding
* Peak picking, median filtering
* CRNN event filter
* Split-merge-filter; delete very long/short events
* Thresholding, merge/filter small events

These techniques are used to refine the model's predictions and improve the accuracy of event detection. However, the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps that may be involved after model training.
