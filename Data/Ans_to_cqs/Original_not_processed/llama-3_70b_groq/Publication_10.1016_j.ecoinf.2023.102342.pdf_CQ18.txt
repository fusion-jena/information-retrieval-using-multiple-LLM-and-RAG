Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which involves identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset to make important decisions. The steps mentioned in the KDD sequence include identification of the aim, pre-selection of data, analytical determinations, optimization and elaboration of results, mapping and interpretation of results, display of results, and decision making. However, there is no mention of training a model or monitoring its performance during training.
