Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is a taxon label classification task, where the model is trained to predict the class (family label) of images from a dataset. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained with a set of images and their corresponding taxon labels, and then used to predict the labels of new, unseen images. The model is evaluated based on its prediction accuracy, and the effect of the number of training images and dataset quality on the accuracy is also investigated.
