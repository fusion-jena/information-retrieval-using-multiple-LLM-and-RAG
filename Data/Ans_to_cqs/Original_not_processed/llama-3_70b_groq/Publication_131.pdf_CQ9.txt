Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. It discusses the structure of the CNN, the training process, and the cyber-physical system used for anuran call classification, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
