Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses various research papers and studies related to image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and fish species classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
