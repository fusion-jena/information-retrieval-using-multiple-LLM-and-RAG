Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of transfer learning, active learning, and different embedding models for audio classification tasks. It discusses the evaluation of embeddings at different layers within the CNNs and the use of pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet152-V2, VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet. 

However, it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
