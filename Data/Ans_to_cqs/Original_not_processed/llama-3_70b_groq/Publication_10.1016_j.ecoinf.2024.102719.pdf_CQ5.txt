Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to river health predictions, ecological informatics, and machine learning models, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
