Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on environmental pollution, water quality management, and applications of machine learning and remote sensing in these areas. It discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) modeling, which is a type of ensemble learning method, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
