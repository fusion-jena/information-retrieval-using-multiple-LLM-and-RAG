Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored using the validation dataset, which consisted of 15% of the total images (19,614 images). The model was trained on the training dataset, and its performance was evaluated on the validation dataset to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This is a common practice in machine learning, where the model's performance is evaluated on a separate dataset during training to monitor its performance and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly.
