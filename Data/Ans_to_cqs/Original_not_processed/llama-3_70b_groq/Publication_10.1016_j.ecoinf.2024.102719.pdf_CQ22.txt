Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for river quality assessment, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions bias-variance decomposition, which is a technique used to evaluate the generalizability of machine learning models. This suggests that the authors may be interested in evaluating the model's performance in terms of its ability to generalize to unseen data, but the specific metrics used for this evaluation are not mentioned.

In general, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared, among others. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which metrics were used in this particular study.
