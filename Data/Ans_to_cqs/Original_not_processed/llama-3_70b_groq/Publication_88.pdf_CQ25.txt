Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically deforestation detection. This is evident from the text, which mentions that the model has a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes. Additionally, the loss function used is binary cross-entropy, which is commonly used for binary classification problems. The model is trained to classify images into one of these two classes, indicating whether deforestation is present or not.
