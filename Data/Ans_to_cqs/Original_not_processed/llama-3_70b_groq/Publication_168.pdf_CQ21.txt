Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experiment setup, model architecture, and results discussion. It does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or validation is performed, as the authors mention the classification performance and provide a classification map in Fig. 6. They also compare the performance of their model (SSPCNN) with other models (SVM, 1-D-CNN, and 2-D-CNN). 

But, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved.
