Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a MaxEnt model used for species distribution modeling, and it discusses the input variables, permutation importance, and percent contribution of different environmental and territorial variables. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
