Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references related to various topics such as grassland net primary productivity, cropland suitability, vegetation dynamics, flood susceptibility mapping, and dry-wet variations, but it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
