Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the FishInTurbidWater dataset was "quickly and weakly labeled" to contribute to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters. It does not provide further details on the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
