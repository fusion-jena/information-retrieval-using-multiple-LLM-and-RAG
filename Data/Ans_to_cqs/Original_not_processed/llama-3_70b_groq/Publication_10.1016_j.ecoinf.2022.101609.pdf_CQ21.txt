Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the MLOps layer, data preprocessing, model training, and validation set creation. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
