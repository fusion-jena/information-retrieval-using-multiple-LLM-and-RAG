Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions that the model was trained using a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
