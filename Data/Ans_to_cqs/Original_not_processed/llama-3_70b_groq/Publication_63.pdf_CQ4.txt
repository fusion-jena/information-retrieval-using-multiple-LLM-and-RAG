Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Horizontal and vertical flipping
* Adjusting the contrast, saturation, and brightness of the images (between factors of 0.9 and 1.1 each)

These techniques are mentioned in the context as part of the image augmentation procedure to inflate the amount of training data and assist the CNN in learning spatial features independent of the data acquisition. There is no mention of rotating or scaling in the provided context.
