Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10−4). This suggests that the initial learning rate was 10−3, but the exact value is not specified. Additionally, the optimizer used is not mentioned at all. Therefore, I don't know the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
