Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are related to the performance of the model on a validation set. Specifically, the context mentions "cross-validation to optimize the parameters" and "error of 1% and a standard deviation of 1.1e-11" in the context of predicting the total EF of Beijing. This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the model achieves a certain level of accuracy or error threshold on the validation set.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of R2 values to evaluate the performance of the model, with a maximum R2 value of 0.94 indicating the best answer for the independent and dependent variables. This suggests that the training process may be considered complete when the model achieves a certain level of R2 value or explanatory power.

However, there is no explicit mention of a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau. Therefore, it is unclear whether this specific criterion is used to determine when training is complete.
