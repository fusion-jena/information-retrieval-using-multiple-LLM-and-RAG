Answer:::
Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. 

These metrics are calculated based on true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 

The performance metrics of the five CNN models are shown in Table 4, which includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. The best CNN model is selected based on the accuracy metric.
