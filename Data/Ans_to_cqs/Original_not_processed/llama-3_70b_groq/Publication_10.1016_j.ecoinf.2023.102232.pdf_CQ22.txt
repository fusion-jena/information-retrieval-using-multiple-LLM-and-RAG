Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance. The text discusses a hybrid approach combining least squares methods with genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate model parameters, but it does not involve deep learning. The evaluation of the algorithm's performance is not explicitly mentioned in terms of specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
