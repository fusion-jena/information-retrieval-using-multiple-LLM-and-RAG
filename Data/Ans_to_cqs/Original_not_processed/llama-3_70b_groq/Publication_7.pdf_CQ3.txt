Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The paper focuses on the use of deep learning for automatic annotation of coral reefs, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used for the training data.

However, it is mentioned that the Benthoz15 dataset [23] is used, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This suggests that the dataset is annotated by experts, but the specific annotation techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
