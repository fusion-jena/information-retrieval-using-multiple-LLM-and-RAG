Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models, such as SegFormer, HRNet, and PSPNet, and provides metrics like IOU and PA for each category. It also explains the architecture of the SegFormer model, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
