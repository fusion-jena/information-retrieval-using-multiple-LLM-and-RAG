Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that "all augmentation techniques were applied" to increase training sample diversity, but it does not provide a list of specific techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. Therefore, I don't know the exact techniques used.
