Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used in this study. It is also mentioned that general image-based CNN architectures may not be appropriate for the data, and other approaches such as one-dimensional CNN, recurrent neural networks, or graph convolutional networks could be interesting topics. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model is a type of neural network, but the specific type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified.
