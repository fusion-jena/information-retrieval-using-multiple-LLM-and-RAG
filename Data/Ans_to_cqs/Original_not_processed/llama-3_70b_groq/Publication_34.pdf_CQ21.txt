Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, such as mean loss, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is involved, as the context mentions that "several model performance metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which is used for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities." This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed, but the specific details are not provided.

As for saliency maps and confusion matrix, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether these postprocessing steps are involved or not.

In summary, while metrics calculation is likely involved, the context does not provide explicit information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps and confusion matrix.
