Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing the use of DeepLabV3+ for vegetation detection, but it does not provide information about the data repository link. The tables and figures provided are related to the training parameters and results of the model, but they do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
