Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context only discusses the model's architecture, performance, and comparison with other models, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
