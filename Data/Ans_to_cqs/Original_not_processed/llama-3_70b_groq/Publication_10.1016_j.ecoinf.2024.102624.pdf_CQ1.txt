Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and hyperspectral image classification, discussing topics such as data augmentation, post-classification, and feature selection. It also references various studies and papers related to ecological informatics and remote sensing.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data might be collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery, which provide hyperspectral data. This is suggested by the mention of "Planetscope spectral data" and various spectral indices (e.g., NDVI, NDRE, vNDVI) used in the context.

It is also possible that the raw data might be collected through sensors, such as those used in wetland ecosystems, as mentioned in one of the referenced papers. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that remote sensing technologies and possibly sensors might be used for collecting raw data. However, the exact methods used for data collection are not specified.
