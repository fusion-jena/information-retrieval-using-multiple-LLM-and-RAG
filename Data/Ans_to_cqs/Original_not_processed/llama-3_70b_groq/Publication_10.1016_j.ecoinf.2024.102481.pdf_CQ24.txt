Answer: 

The provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of Random Forest machine learning techniques in fisheries biology, specifically for classifying the reproductive condition of Chilean hake. It discusses the advantages of using Random Forest over traditional methods like macroscopy and histology, and cites various studies that have successfully applied machine learning techniques in fisheries biology.

There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given information.
