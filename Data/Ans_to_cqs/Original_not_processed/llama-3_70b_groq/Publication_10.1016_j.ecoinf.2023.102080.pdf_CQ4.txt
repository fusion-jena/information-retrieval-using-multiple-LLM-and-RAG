Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a package called "covsel" and its functions for covariate selection, specifically for species distribution modeling. It discusses steps for filtering and embedding covariates, but does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques.
