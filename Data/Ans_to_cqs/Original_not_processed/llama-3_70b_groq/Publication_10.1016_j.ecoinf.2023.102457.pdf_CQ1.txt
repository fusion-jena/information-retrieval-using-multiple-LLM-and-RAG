Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in bioacoustics, feature extraction, and classification, as well as the use of pre-trained models like VGGish and BirdNET for extracting embeddings. It does not provide information on how the raw data is collected.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data might be in the form of audio recordings or sound files, as the context mentions the use of Mel-spectrograms and waveforms as input to the deep learning models. Additionally, the mention of YouTube-8M dataset in the context suggests that public datasets might be used as a source of raw data. However, this is speculative, and the exact methods of data collection are not explicitly stated.

In summary, the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and it is unclear what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
