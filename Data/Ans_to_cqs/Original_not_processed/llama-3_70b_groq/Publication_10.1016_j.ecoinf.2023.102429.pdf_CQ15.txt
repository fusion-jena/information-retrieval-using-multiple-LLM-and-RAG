Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to soil nutrient concentration analysis and discusses various machine learning models such as PLSR, RF, CWT, LASSO, CNN, SPA, WAPLSR, and MARS, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
