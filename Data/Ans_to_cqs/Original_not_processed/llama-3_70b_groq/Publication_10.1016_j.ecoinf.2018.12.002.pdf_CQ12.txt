Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text discusses machine learning algorithms like random forests, support vector machines, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, and neural networks, but it does not specify the use of any deep learning models in a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
