Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the architecture and hyperparameter tuning of various models, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and U-Net, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using metrics such as testing accuracy and kappa, as mentioned in the context. Additionally, the context mentions the use of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, which suggests that the model performance was evaluated using a cross-validation approach. Nevertheless, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated.
