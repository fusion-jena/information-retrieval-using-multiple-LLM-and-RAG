Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation has been performed, as the results of various evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE are presented in the tables. Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of variable importance, which might be related to feature importance or saliency maps. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices.

It is also worth noting that the context focuses on the performance evaluation of different machine learning models for predicting forest canopy cover, and the results are presented in terms of various evaluation metrics. There is no mention of any specific postprocessing steps beyond the calculation of these metrics.
