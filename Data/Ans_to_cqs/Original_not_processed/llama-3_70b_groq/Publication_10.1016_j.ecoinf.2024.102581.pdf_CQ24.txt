Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation techniques are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the following techniques are mentioned: random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques are applied during the learning phase of the CNN using Kera's flow_from_directory method. This approach ensures that the model is trained on a diverse set of images, covering all possible cases that might occur in the real world.

However, there is no mention of using a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors may have used a random seed value, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
