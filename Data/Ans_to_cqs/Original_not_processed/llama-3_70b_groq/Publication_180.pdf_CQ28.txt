Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform, was used for deep learning research and applications, and that it was adapted and configured for application and use in the project via Python. It does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
