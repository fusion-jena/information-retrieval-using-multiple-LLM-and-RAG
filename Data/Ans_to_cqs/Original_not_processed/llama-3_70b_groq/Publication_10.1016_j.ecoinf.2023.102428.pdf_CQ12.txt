Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This is mentioned in section 2.5.1, which describes the MLPnn-MC modelling approach that integrates the MLP algorithm with Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
