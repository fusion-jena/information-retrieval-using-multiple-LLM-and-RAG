Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to ecological zoning, conservation planning, and spatial analysis, but it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. The equations and formulas provided seem to be related to spatial autocorrelation and clustering analysis, but they do not provide insight into model performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
