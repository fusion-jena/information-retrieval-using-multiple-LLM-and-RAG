Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Light-trapping lamps: As mentioned in reference 5, a new LED lamp is used for the collection of nocturnal Lepidoptera.

2. Internet images: According to reference 6, fine-grained datasets are augmented with selected internet images.

3. RGB-D dataset: The context mentions the use of an RGB-D dataset, which suggests that data is collected using RGB (red, green, blue) and depth sensors.

4. Public datasets: The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset (reference 33) is a public dataset that is used for species classification and detection tasks.

5. Surveys: Although not explicitly mentioned, reference 7, "Distance Sampling: Methods and Applications", suggests that surveys might be used for collecting data, especially in the context of ecology and species occurrence data.

It is important to note that the provided context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Other methods might be used depending on the specific application and task.
