Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the hardware resource used for image processing is the NVIDIA Volta GPU with 512 CUDA cores, which is part of the Jetson AGX Xavier-embedded computing system. This system also includes an 8-core ARMv8.2 CPU. However, it is not explicitly stated that this hardware is used for training the deep learning model. It is possible that the model was trained on a different system or hardware configuration. Therefore, I cannot confirm the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
