Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the model architecture, training process, and evaluation results, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The context only mentions that the Google Image Search dataset is created by automatically retrieving the top 10 images for each label, which might result in some minor mislabeled or corrupt examples. However, it does not provide any information about how the data is annotated.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
