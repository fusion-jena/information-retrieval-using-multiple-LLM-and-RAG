Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text describes the network setup, including the use of a ResNet50, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and AdamW optimizer, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It is possible that the authors used a specific method, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
