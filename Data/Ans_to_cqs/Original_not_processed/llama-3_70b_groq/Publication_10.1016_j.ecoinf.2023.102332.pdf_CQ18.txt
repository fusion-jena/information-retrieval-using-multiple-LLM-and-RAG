The provided context does not mention anything about model training or performance monitoring. The text appears to be discussing a study on hiking trails, where data is collected from Wikiloc and processed using natural language processing techniques to extract information about landscape features, outdoor activities, and hikers' perceptions. There is no mention of a model being trained or its performance being monitored.
