Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to audio signal processing and acoustic monitoring, discussing topics such as recording devices, sampling frequencies, and gain levels. There is a mention of machine learning and deep learning in the context of broader comparative analyses, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
