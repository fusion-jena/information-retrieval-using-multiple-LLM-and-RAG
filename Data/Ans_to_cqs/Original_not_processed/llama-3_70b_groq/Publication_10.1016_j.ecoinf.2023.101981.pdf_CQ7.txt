Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses statistical analyses, acoustic data analyses, and the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting ungulate vocalizations, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
