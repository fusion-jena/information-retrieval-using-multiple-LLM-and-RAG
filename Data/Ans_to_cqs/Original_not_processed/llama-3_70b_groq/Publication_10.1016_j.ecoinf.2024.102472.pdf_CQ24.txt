Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the description of machine learning models, including gradient boosting and artificial neural networks, and their applications in predicting carbon stocks and biomass. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of arbitrary connection weights during the training phase of the artificial neural network, which implies some level of randomness. Additionally, the context mentions the use of iterative error back-propagation to adjust connection weights until reaching a target minimal error, which could be related to handling randomness. 

Despite this, the context does not provide explicit information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
