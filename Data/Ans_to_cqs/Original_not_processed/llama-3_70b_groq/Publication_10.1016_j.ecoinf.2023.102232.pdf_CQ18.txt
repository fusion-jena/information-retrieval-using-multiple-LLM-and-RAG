Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters from field data. It discusses the workflow of the algorithm, including the use of genetic algorithms to explore the space of parameters, least squares method to preliminary optimize the parameter values, and MCMC algorithm to tune the parameter estimation and provide the statistical distribution and uncertainty associated with each parameter. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
