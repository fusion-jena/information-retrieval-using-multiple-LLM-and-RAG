Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are related to fisheries acoustics techniques. These techniques facilitate the collection of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales without causing any disturbance.

Specifically, the context mentions the use of scientific echosounders in the West African water to acquire a multifrequency acoustics dataset. Additionally, it mentions the use of a towed multiparameter system to represent environmental conditions at a fine scale.

It also references other studies that utilized different methods for collecting data, such as electronic recorders deployed on marine predators, remote sensing data, and nets for collecting zooplanktonic communities.

However, it does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these methods are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are primarily related to fisheries acoustics techniques, including the use of scientific echosounders and towed multiparameter systems.
