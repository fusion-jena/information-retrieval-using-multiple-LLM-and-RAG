Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions the experimental training parameter settings, including the number of epochs (150), but it does not specify how to determine when to stop training. 

However, Fig. 11 shows the convergence of P, R, and mAP50 during training and the loss of cls_loss during validation for the four experimental models. This suggests that the authors might be monitoring the convergence of these metrics to determine when training is complete. 

But, without further information, it is unclear what specific criteria are used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or a certain level of convergence of the metrics.
