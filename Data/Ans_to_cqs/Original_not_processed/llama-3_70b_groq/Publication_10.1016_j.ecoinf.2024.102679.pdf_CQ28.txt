Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning for wildlife population estimation, aerial surveys, and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The references cited are research papers and articles, but they do not mention the deployment platform either. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
