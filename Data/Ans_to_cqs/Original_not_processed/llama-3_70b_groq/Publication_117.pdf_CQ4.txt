Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the images were "tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages" and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. There is no mention of flipping, rotating, scaling, or any other data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
