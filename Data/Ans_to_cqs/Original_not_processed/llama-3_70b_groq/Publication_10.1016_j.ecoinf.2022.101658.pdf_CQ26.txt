Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. Specifically, the authors employed three data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size fourfold: horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction. The contrast reduction strategy was motivated by the expectation of shadows occluding vegetation types in the images, which helps to simulate areas of low lighting in the dataset. There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in this context.
