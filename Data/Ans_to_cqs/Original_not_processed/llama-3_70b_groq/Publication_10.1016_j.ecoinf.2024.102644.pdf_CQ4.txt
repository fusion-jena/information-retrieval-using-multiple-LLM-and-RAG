Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, data quality, and policy-making, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques or deep learning. The references cited are also related to species distribution modeling, data quality, and computational biology, but they do not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
