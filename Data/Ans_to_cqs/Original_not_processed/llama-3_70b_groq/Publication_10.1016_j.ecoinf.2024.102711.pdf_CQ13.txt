Answer: The context provided does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models, which are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. The hyperparameters tuned for these models are:

* Maximum depth of the tree
* Number of trees in the ensemble model (n_estimators)
* Learning rate

These hyperparameters are tuned using a 5-fold cross-validation process and grid search to evaluate the model's performance using each combination of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best hyperparameters.

There is no mention of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters, such as optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
