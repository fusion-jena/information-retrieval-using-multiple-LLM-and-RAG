Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and ResNet, which are types of neural network architectures, but it does not specify the framework used to implement them. 

Frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras could be used to build and train these models, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which one was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
