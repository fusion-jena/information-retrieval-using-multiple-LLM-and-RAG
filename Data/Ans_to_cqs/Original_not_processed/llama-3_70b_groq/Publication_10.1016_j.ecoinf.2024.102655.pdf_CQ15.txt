Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses various machine learning models, including ANFIS, ANN, SVM, LSTM, and RNN, and their performance in predicting water quality data. It also mentions techniques such as Artificial Bee Colony, Back Propagation Neural Network, and variational mode decomposition, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
