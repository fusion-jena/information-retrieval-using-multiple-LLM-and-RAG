Answer::: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is for the automatic annotation of marine images, which involves classifying images into different categories such as coral and non-coral. The model is trained on a dataset of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas, and it uses feature representations extracted from a deep neural network to perform the classification task.
