Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the potential of a hierarchical classification model for medicinal plant species classification and its practical deployment as a smartphone-based application. However, it does not provide information on how a deep learning model was deployed. The context mentions the use of deep learning models in other studies, but it does not elaborate on the deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
