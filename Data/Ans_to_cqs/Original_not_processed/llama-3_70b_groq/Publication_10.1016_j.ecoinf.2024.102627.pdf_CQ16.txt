Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the training stops at the best epoch previously determined on the validation set (epoch 69). This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored, and training is stopped when the model's performance reaches a certain level or plateaus.
