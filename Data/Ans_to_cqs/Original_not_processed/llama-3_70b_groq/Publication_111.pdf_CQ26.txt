Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture of the Stacked GRU-DNN model, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. It discusses overfitting and underfitting issues and proposes solutions such as early stopping and dropout. However, it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
