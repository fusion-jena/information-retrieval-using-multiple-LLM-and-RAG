Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables, and references several studies and papers, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
