Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the architecture adjustments required for accommodating four-channel input images. It also mentions the use of a pre-trained model and fine-tuning the weights, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
