Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or platform where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The text mentions "open access data" and "open source code" in the context of research practices, but it does not provide a specific link or reference to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
