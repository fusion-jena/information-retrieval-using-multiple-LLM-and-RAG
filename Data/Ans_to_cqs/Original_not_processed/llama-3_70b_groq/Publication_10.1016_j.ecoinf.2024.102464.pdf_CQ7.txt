Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution, and it discusses the performance of different models, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). It also mentions the variables used in the species distribution model, including land cover, vegetation, terrain, and distance. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for model training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
