Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing carbon sinks, ecological risk reduction, and ecosystem services, with references to various studies and formulas. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
