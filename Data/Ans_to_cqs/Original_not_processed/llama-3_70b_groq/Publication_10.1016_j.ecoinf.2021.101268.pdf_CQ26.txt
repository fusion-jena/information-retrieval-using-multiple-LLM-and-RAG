Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context only mentions that the pre-processing stage reduces noises and standardizes inputs, which enhances metrics. However, it does not provide specific details on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
