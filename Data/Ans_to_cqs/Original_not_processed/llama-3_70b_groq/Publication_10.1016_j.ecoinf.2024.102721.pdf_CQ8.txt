Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of deep learning methods for forecasting ecological water demand, but it does not provide any information about the code used in the research. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
