Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, and their applications in agriculture. It discusses the advantages of Bayesian neural networks in handling uncertainty, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
