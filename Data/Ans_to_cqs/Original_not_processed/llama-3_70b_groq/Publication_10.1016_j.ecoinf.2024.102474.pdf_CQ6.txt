Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only discusses the model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and training procedure, but does not provide information about preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
