Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, Scaling, etc. 

However, I can suggest that you refer to the paper "A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning" by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) which is part of the provided context. This paper might provide a comprehensive overview of various data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.
