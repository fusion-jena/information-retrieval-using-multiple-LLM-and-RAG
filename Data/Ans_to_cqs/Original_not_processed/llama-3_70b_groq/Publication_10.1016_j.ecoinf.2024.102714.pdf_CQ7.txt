Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is to split the polygons rather than pixels, which minimizes the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies. This is mentioned in the context as "Splitting polygons rather than pixels minimises the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies (Karasiak et al., 2022)". Additionally, it is mentioned that ~30% of pixels for each VT (vegetation type) were reserved for independent model validation.
