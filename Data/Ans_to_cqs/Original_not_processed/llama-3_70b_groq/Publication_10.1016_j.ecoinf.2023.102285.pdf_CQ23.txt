Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors took some steps to ensure the model's generalizability. 

In Phase III, the authors prepared a dataset to evaluate the eligibility of the methodology, which consisted of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images with no ISMMMOs. This dataset was not included in the dataset used for establishing the methodology, indicating that the authors attempted to test the model on an independent dataset. 

Furthermore, in Phase IV, the authors validated the model by field experts using the most recent surveys, which suggests that they used a new, independent dataset to evaluate the model's performance. 

Although the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset, the authors' approach of testing the model on independent datasets in Phases III and IV suggests that they attempted to ensure the model's generalizability. However, more information is needed to determine the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
