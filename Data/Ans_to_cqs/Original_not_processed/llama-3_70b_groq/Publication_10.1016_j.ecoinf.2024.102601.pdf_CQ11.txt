Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the optimization of data structures for machine learning classification, specifically in the context of satellite imagery, and the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
