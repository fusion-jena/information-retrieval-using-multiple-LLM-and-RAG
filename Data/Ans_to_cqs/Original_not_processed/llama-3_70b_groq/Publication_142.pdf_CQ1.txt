Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Social media imagery: Images collected from social media platforms such as Flickr and Instagram.
2. Camera traps: Images collected from camera traps used for wildlife recording.
3. CCTV: Images collected from closed-circuit television cameras.
4. Imagery collected along linear infrastructure: Images collected from sources such as Google StreetView.
5. Citizen science: Data collected through citizen science initiatives, where citizens contribute data for scientific research.

It is also mentioned that traditional approaches such as classical statistical analyses and classification by citizen scientists are used to process these data into useful information.

However, it is important to note that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data, and it is likely that other methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets may also be used in certain applications.
