Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on Hyperband, a method for efficient hyperparameter tuning, and its application to a specific problem. It does not discuss randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that Hyperband does employ an initial random search to explore the hyperparameter space. This random search is used to identify promising configurations, which are then further trained and evaluated using the successive halving strategy. But this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seed values, using reproducible random number generators, or employing ensemble methods to average out random variations. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
