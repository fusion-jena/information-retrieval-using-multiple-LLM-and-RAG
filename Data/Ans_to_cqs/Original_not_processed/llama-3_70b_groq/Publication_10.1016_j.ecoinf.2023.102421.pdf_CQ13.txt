Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Bayesian optimization and Swarm-based algorithms, and their application to XGBoost and LightGBM models. It discusses the use of different optimizers, such as BO, BOHB, and TDO, to tune the hyperparameters of these models, but it does not provide the specific values or ranges of the hyperparameters themselves.

Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the given context.
