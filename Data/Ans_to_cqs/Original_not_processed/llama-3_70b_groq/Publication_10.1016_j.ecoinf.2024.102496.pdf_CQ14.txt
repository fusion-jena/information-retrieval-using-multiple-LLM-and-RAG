Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be describing a tool or platform that provides information about environmental justice metrics, pollutant loads, and best management practices (BMPs) for watersheds and census tracts. It includes figures and tables that illustrate the tool's features and data, but it does not provide any information about machine learning models or their optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
