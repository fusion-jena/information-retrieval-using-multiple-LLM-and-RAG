Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a ecological model, specifically a Floodplain Ecosystem Response Model (FERM), and does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses parameters and equations related to ecological health, flooding, and dry spells, but does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
