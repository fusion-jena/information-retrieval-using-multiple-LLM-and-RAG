Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The text only describes the architecture and training procedure of the model in general terms, without providing details about the implementation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
