Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the limitations of the model as a classification model, modifications to improve the model, and mathematical derivations related to the Von Neumann model. There is no mention of postprocessing steps or evaluation metrics commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
