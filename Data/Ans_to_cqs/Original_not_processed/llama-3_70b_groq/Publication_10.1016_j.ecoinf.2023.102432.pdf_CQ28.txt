Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of remote sensing imagery from various sources (NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat) and the application of a multiple-instance learning algorithm to detect Brazilian peppertree, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
