Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call. This suggests that the authors have taken steps to ensure that the test set is representative of the overall data distribution, which can help mitigate the effects of randomness.

Additionally, the context mentions that 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20% as tests, which is a common strategy to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of a machine learning model. This could also help reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline, such as setting a random seed value or using techniques like dropout or batch normalization. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
