Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the experiments were run on a machine with "an Intel i7 processor, 32Gb of RAM, and a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU." However, it is not explicitly stated whether the GPU was used for training the deep learning model. It is only mentioned that the BatDetect CNNFULL used a GPU at test time, but it does not provide information about the training process. Therefore, I don't know if the GPU was used for training the model.
