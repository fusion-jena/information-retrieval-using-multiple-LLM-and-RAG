Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. It discusses the importance of training data, data drift, domain adaptation, and the training process of deep learning models, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning. However, it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
