Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep learning models, the input features, and the performance of the models on the bird sound classification task. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
