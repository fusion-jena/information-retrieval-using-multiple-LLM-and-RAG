Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the TrunkNet model are optimized. However, it does provide some information about the hyperparameters used for training the model. According to the text, the model is trained with the Adam optimizer with default hyperparameters: betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1.0 × 10^(-8), and weight_decay = 0. The initial learning rate is set to 1.0 × 10^(-3). 

There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. It seems that the authors have used the default hyperparameters of the Adam optimizer without performing any hyperparameter tuning.
