Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically CNN architectures, for predicting and comparing water quality across different water bodies. It discusses the use of CNN models, LSTM combined approaches, and remote sensing for water quality monitoring, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
