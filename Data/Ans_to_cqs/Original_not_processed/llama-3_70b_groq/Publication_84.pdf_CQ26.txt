Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), for Landsat image classification and the integration of phenological knowledge to improve performance. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
