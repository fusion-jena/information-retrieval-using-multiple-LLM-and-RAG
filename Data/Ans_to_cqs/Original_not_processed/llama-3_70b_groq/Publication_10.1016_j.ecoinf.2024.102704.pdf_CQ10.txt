Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the performance of various object detection models, including LigObNet, and their applications in fish detection. It provides references to other research papers and publications, but does not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
