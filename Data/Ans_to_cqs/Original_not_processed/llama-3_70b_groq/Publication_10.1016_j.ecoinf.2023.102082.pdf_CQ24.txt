Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches in remote sensing and ecology, specifically in creating high-resolution CHMs and assessing biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems. It does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline implementation or handling randomness. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
