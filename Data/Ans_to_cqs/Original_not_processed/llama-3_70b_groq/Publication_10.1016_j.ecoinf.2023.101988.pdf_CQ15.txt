Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of unmanned aircraft systems, acoustic monitoring, and deep learning in wildlife research and biodiversity monitoring. It provides references to various studies and papers but does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
