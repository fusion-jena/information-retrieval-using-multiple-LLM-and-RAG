Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that generating training and test data by sampling designs such as random sampling or allocating samples in proportion to expected class areas would result in a highly unbalanced dataset. This suggests that the authors were aware of the potential issue of data bias.

The context also mentions that the authors were able to create a reasonably balanced final training dataset having 38% iceplant points and 62% other vegetation points without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points. This implies that they might have used some technique to balance the dataset, but the specific technique is not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
