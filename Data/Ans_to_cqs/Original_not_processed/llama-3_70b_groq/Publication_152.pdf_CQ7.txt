Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the methodology and results of a specific deep learning model (U-Net) for identifying an invasive vegetation species (Hedychium Coronarium) using UAV-captured images. It discusses data gathering, pre-processing, and training the model, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
