Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental research, with mentions of Google Earth Engine, satellite imagery, and land use/land cover classification. While it does mention deep learning and convolutional neural networks in the context of detecting artisanal small-scale mining, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in these pipelines.
