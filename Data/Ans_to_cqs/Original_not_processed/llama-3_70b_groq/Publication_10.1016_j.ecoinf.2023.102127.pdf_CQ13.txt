Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses species distribution models, Bayesian models, and machine learning approaches, but it does not provide specific information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
