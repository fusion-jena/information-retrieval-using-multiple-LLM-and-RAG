Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the importance of resampling techniques, specifically bootstrapping, in improving the precision of species distribution models (SDMs). It discusses how bootstrapping can reduce stochastic errors in estimation by providing a combination of models. 

The context does not provide information on postprocessing steps, which are typically used to evaluate and interpret the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
