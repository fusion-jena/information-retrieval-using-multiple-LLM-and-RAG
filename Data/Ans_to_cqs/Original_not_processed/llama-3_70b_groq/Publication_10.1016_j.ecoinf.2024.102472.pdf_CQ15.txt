Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the training process of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs), and mentions the use of backpropagation for error computation and weight adjustment. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to update the model parameters.

In the context of MLPNN training, the learning rate is mentioned as 0.01, which is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of each update in the optimization process. However, the optimization algorithm itself is not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
