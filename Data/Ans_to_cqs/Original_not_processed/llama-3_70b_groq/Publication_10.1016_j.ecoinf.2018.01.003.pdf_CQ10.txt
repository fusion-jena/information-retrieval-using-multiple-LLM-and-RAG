Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various machine learning models, including BPNN and SVM, as well as their applications in different fields. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the provided context.
