Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are resizing and padding. The original weed images, which were mostly with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 800 Ã— 800 pixels, which is compatible with model architectures and training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the original image aspect ratio.

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context. However, it is common in deep learning to perform these steps as part of data preprocessing, but it is not explicitly mentioned in this specific context.

It is worth noting that data augmentation techniques such as jitter, mosaic, random crop, and scale augmentation were used during training, but these are not typically considered preprocessing steps.
