Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "data preprocessing pipeline" and "missing value imputation" as part of the approach to handle imperfect footprints. This suggests that the authors are using some form of data preprocessing, but the specific steps are not detailed.

It can be inferred that the authors are using missing value imputation as a preprocessing step to handle incomplete prints, but other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, it is unclear what other preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning model.

In summary, the only preprocessing step mentioned in the context is missing value imputation, but other preprocessing steps are not specified.
