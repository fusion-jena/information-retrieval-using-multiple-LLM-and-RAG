Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image acquisition, processing, and pre-processing of remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands and Google Earth Engine (GEE). It discusses various aspects of image pre-processing, such as de-clouding, mosaicking, cropping, geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, but does not mention data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
