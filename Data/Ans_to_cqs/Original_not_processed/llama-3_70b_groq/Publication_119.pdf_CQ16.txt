Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the architecture and hyperparameter tuning of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, as well as the performance of other classification models such as U-Net, SVM, and RF. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, or a maximum number of epochs is reached. Other criteria might include convergence of the model's weights, or a target level of accuracy or loss is achieved. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
