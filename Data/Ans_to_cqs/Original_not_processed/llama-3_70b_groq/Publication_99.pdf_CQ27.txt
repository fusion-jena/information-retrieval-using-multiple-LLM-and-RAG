Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architectures, and hyperparameters used for different types of networks (PConv, Pix2Pix, and classification networks). It discusses the preprocessing of input images, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, loss functions, and epochs used for training each model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
