Answer: 

The provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches in R, and it discusses the use of different models, model performance evaluation, and climate scenarios. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
