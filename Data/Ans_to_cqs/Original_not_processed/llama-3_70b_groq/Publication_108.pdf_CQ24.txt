Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter fine-tuning results, encoding path, and advantages/disadvantages of deep learning. It also references various papers and studies related to deep learning, optimization methods, and forest damage assessment.

However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Randomness can be introduced through various means, such as random initialization of weights, random shuffling of data, or random selection of hyperparameters. To handle randomness, strategies like setting a fixed random seed, using reproducible random number generators, or employing techniques like dropout and batch normalization can be employed. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the context does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, and therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
