Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on model development, variable importance, and model evaluation using techniques such as stratified sampling, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

However, it is worth noting that stratified sampling is mentioned as a technique used to split the data into training and validation datasets, which can help mitigate some bias issues. But this is not explicitly mentioned as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
