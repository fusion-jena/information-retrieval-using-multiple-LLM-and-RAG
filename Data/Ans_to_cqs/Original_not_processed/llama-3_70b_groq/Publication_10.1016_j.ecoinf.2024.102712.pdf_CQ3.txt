Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forestry, discussing data sources such as Sentinel-2, GEDI, and field data, as well as spatial and temporal resolutions. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
