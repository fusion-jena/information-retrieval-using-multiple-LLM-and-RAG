Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil nutrient concentration analysis, spectral reflectance, and partial least squares regression (PLSR). It includes tables, equations, and references to various studies, but it does not provide information about deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
