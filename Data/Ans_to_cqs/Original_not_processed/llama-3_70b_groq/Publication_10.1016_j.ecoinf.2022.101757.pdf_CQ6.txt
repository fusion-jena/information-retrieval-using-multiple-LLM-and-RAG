Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model with the COCO dataset, and the application of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the delineation of the skyline in landscape photos. 

It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were performed on the COCO dataset or the landscape photos before training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
