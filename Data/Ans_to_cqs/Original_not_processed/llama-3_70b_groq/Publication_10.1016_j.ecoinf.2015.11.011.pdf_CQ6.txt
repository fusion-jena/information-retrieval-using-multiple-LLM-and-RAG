Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, machine learning techniques, and the use of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) for analysis. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "pre-processing of imagery" in section 2.3, but it does not elaborate on the specific steps involved in this process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
