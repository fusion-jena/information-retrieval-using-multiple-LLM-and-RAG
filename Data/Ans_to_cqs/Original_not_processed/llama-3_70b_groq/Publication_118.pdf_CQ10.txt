Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in "Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch" by github user "eelxpeng" (eelxpeng, 2018), but it does not provide a direct link to the repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
