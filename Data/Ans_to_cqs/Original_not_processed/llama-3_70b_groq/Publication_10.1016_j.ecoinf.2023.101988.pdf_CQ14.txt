Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model hyperparameters or their optimization. The text appears to be discussing a study on species detection and survey methods, and it presents results from linear mixed modeling. However, it does not provide information on how the model's hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
