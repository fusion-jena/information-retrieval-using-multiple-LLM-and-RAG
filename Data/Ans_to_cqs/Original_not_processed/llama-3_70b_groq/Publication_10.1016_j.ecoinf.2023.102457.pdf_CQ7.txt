Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It discusses the potential of deep learning models in feature extraction and classification for animal population monitoring, and describes a specific approach to extract embeddings from a pre-trained BirdNET model. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.
