Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, machine learning techniques, and the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for analysis. It does not provide information on post-processing steps after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
