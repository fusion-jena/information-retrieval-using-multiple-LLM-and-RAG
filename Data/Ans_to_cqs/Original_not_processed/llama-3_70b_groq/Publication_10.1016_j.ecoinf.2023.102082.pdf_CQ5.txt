Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 images, GEDI data, and Landsat 8 OLI imagery, but it does not mention traditional deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context is focused on using deep learning approaches for forest ecosystem monitoring and vegetation structure analysis, and the datasets used are specific to this domain.
