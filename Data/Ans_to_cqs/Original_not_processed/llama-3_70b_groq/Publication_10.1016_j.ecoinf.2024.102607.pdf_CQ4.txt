Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses sampling techniques for addressing unbalanced training data, including undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both. It also mentions a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and image presegmentation, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
