Answer::: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80:10:10, which is a common practice to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

Secondly, the training set was augmented in various ways, including flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. This augmentation helps the model to learn robust features that are invariant to these transformations, thereby improving its generalizability.

Additionally, the large size of the dataset, with 426,876 images, also contributes to the model's generalizability. This is evident from the fact that the model was able to classify five out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen grains with an accuracy higher than 90%.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
