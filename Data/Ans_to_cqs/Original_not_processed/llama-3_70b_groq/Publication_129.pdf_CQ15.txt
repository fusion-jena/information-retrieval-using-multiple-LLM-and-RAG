Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the Faster R-CNN approach, including the Region Proposal Network (RPN), feature extractor network, Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, and classifier and regressor branches. It also discusses the loss function L used for training the CNN detection network, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to minimize this loss function. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
