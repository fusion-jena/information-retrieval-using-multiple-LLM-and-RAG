Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the architecture and design of the multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) and its components, including Res2Net modules, group convolution, and various convolutional layers. It discusses the challenges of feature extraction and the improvements made to the Deep SORT algorithm, but it does not provide information on optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
