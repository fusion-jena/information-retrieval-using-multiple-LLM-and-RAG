Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

* Horizontal flip
* Image cropping
* Grayscale
* Image blur (up to 10px)
* Image noise (up to 10% of pixels)

These techniques are applied randomly to each image before input into the model, which helps to extend the amount of information and acts as a regularizer to reduce overfitting.
