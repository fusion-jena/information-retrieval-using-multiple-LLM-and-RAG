Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model, but it does discuss the performance of various models (Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes) in terms of their mean accuracies and standard deviations. Therefore, it can be inferred that the metric used to evaluate the performance of these models is accuracy. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score.
