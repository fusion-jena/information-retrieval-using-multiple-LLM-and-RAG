Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (ANN) are:

* Number of nodes in the input layer (units): 90
* Number of nodes in the middle layers (units): 60
* Activation function: ReLU
* Optimizer: Adam

These hyperparameters were optimized using Optuna, and the specific values were determined to be the best for the model. The learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
