Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geospatial data, discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data and atmospheric correction methods. It does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
