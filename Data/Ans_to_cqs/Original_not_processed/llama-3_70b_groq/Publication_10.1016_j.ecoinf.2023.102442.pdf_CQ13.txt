Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context provides information about various research papers and studies related to remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental monitoring, but it does not provide details about the deep learning model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
