Answer: According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics, including:

* Accuracy: measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images.
* Precision: not explicitly defined in the context, but it is mentioned as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models.
* Recall: not explicitly defined in the context, but it is mentioned as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models.
* F1 Score: not explicitly defined in the context, but it is mentioned as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models.
* Confusion Matrix: tabulates the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning models in image classification tasks.
