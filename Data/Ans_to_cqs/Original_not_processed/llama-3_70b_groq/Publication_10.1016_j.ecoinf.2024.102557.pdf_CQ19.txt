Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the application of deep learning in ecology, conservation biology, and environmental science, but it does not provide information about the implementation details of the models. The papers cited in the context focus on the use of machine learning and deep learning in ecology, but they do not specify the frameworks used to build the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
