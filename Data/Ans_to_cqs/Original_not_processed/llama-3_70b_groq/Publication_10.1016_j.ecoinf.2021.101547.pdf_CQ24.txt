Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the mini-batch size, image cropping, and training image manipulations and augmentations. It does mention random selection and cropping of photos, but this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it can be inferred that the authors are using randomization techniques to some extent, such as randomly selecting and cropping photos, and randomly selecting background validation images. This suggests that the authors are attempting to introduce randomness into the training process to improve the model's generalizability.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value or using other techniques to control randomness. Therefore, I don't know the exact strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
