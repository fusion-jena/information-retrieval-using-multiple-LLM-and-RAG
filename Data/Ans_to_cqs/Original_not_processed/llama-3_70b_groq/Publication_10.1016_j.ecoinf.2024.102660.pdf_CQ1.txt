Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development and evaluation of the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. It discusses the network architecture, training, and testing processes, as well as the performance metrics achieved on the WSGD dataset.

However, it can be inferred that the WSGD dataset is used for training and testing the Res_AUNet network. The context mentions that the dataset consists of image pairs, which were cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. The origin and collection method of these image pairs are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
