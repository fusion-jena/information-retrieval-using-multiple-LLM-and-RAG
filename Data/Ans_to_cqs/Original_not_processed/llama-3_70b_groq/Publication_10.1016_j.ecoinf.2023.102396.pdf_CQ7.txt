Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a research article on ecological informatics, specifically on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series. It discusses topics such as Gompertz population models, natural log transformations, and variance, but does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
