Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are F1 scores, precision, and recall. The F1 score is specifically mentioned as a commonly used metric that balances both missing predictions (FN) and not predicting too many instances (FP). Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is also evaluated using mean average precision (mAP) in the supplement, but it is not considered informative for the current study. There is no mention of accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance.
