Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. It mentions machine learning algorithms in general and mentions other types of models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning, but it does not specify a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
