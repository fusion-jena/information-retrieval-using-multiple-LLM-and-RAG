Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that batch normalization is performed on the input data as a preprocessing step before training a deep learning model. Specifically, the mean of each channel in the current batch is calculated, and then, the variance of each channel in the current batch is calculated. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation to obtain the normalized output. This normalized output is then multiplied by a scale parameter γ and added to a shift parameter β to obtain the final output.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or feature normalization are performed. However, it is clear that batch normalization is an essential step in the preprocessing pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information about other preprocessing steps that might be involved, such as handling missing values, data augmentation, or feature engineering. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
