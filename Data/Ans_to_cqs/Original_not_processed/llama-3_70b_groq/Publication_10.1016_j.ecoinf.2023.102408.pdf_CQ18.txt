Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE (as indicated in Eqs. 8, 9, and 10). Additionally, a stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations, where 70% of the samples were allocated to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated on the validation dataset during training.
