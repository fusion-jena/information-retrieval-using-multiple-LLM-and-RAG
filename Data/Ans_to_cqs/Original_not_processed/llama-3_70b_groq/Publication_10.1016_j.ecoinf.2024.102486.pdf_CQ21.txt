Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to particle filters, Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and simulation-based inference, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
