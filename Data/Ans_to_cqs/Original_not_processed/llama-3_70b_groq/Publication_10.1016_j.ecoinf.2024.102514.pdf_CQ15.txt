Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms and their performance evaluation in water quality prediction tasks, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
