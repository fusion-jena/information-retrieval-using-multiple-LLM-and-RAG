Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to acoustic data and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information about the annotation techniques used. The tables and descriptions seem to be related to manual validations of song recordings and the number of recordings in different sets, but they do not mention annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
