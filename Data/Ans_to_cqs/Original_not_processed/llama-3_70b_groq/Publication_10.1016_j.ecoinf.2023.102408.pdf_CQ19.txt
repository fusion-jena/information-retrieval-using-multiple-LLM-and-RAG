Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and its parameters, such as the learning rate, weight, and activation function, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
