Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in ecological informatics, particularly in marine animal recognition. It discusses the performance of CNNs in classification tasks, one-shot learning, and siamese networks, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
