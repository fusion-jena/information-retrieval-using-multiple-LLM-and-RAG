Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context provides information about the model architecture, dataset, and training procedure, as well as the final test set performances at epoch 69. However, it does not provide details on how the model performance was monitored during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
