Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, results, and analysis of the classification task, but it does not provide information about the training process or the stopping criteria.

The figures mentioned in the context, such as Figures S2 and S3, report the loss and accuracy development during training, but they do not provide insight into the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
