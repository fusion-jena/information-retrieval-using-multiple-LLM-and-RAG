Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning models were used to classify three sympatric otter species, but it does not specify the type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
