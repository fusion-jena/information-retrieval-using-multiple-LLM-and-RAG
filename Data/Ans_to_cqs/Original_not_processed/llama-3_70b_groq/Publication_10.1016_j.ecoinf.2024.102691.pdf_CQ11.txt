Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of YOLOv5 with depth attention for object detection, but it does not provide information about a data repository link. The references cited in the context are academic papers and do not seem to be related to a data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
