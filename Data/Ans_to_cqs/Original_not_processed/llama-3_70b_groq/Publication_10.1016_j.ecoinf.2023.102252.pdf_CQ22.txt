Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any metrics to evaluate its performance, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to be discussing a model called FERM, which is used to calculate condition scores, and the parameters and equations used in this model. The performance of FERM is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score, but this is not in the context of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
