Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The text only discusses the pipeline's functionality, evaluation, and potential applications, but it does not provide information about the code's availability or hosting platform. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is located.
