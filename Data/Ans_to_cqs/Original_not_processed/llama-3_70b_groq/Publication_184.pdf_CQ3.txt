Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is mentioned in the first paragraph, which states that "it is important to provide not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as correct answer." Additionally, it is mentioned that the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the fish in the annotation of the image's dataset were parsed. This suggests that the bounding box annotation technique was used to label the objects (fish) in the images. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques in the provided context.
