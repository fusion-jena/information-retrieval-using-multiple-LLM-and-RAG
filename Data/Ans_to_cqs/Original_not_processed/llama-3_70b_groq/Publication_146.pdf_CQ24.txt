Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, hyperparameter settings, and the choice of optimizer (Adam) for the YoloV3 model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of data augmentation, which can help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness to random variations in the data. Additionally, the choice of the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate algorithm, can also help mitigate the effects of randomness in the optimization process.

Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this question.
