Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing dimensionality reduction methods, specifically UMAP, and its application to species distribution modeling. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks in another study, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
