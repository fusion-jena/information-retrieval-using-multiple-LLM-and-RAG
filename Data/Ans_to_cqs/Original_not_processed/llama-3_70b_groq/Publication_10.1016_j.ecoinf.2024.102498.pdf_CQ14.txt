Answer: The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the validation data were employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model, but it does not specify the optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
