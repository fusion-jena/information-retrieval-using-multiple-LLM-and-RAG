Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation, specifically for forest damage identification. It discusses the architecture of the CNN, the training process, and the use of batch normalization and dropout techniques. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

In semantic segmentation, common data annotation techniques include pixel-wise annotation, where each pixel in the image is labeled with a class, and instance segmentation, where individual objects or instances within a class are annotated. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which specific annotation technique was used in this particular pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline.
