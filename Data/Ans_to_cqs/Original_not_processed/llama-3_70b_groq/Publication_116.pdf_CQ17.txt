Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are Batch Normalization and LRN (Local Response Normalization). There is no mention of dropout or L2 regularization in the context. Batch Normalization is used after all pooling layers, and LRN is used in some of the inception modules. These methods help to reduce overfitting by normalizing the input data and reducing the internal covariate shift.
