Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training parameters of the classification network and object detection models, as well as their performance comparison. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is involved, as the context mentions "Evaluation metrics" in Table 6, which compares the performance of different models. Additionally, the context discusses the use of focal loss, which is a loss function that can help in class imbalance problems, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
