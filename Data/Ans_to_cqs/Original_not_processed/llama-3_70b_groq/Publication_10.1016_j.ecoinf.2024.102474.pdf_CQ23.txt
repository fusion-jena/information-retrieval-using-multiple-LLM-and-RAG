Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the generalizability of the deep learning model was measured using the Ensemble Score (ENS) calculated on four separate test sets. These test sets measure different aspects of model generalizability, but the specific details of how these test sets were created or selected are not provided.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. However, the fact that the data consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe suggests that the dataset may be diverse in terms of geographical location.

It is also worth noting that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, which may have helped to improve the model's generalizability by finding optimal hyperparameters that work well across different scenarios.

Overall, while some measures were taken to evaluate and improve the model's generalizability, the specific details of these measures are not fully described in the provided context.
