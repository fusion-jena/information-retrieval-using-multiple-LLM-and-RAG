Answer:::
The context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that "going forward, the analysis of aerial images of KNP taken about every two years deep learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or more specifically woody cover." However, it does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the study, which is a cloud-based platform for remote sensing and geospatial analysis. It is possible that GEE might be used for deploying the deep learning model, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I don't know the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
