Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It only discusses the use of the Random Forest (RF) model for predicting the drivers of invasive species diversity and mentions its advantages, such as allowing quantification of variable importance for each potential predictor. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
