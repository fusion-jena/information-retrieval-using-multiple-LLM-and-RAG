Answer:::
Answer: The hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). This is evident from the context, which mentions "GPU acceleration" in section 4.3, indicating that the experiments were performed using GPU acceleration to expedite computations. Additionally, section 5.1.5 mentions CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA that allows computing on the GPU. This further supports the use of GPUs for training the deep learning model. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in the provided context.
