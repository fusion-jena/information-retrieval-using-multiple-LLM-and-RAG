Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. The text appears to describe a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, which is a type of unsupervised neural network, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. The context focuses on the SOM algorithm, its components, and its application, but it does not provide information about the programming framework or library used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
