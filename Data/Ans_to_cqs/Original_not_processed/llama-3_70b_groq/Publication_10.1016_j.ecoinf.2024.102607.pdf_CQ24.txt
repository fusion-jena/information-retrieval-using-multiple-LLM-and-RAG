Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on land use/land cover (LULC) mapping using remote sensing and machine learning techniques, specifically a novel space-spectrum array tile probability random-forest model on Google Earth Engine.

The context mentions various techniques, such as multiple probabilistic classification, ensemble techniques, and random forest, but it does not discuss handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
