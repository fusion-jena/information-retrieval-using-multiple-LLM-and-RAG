Answer:::

The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is splitting the merged .wav training file for each species in half and then adding these two halves sample-wise. This augmented .wav file was similarly split into 2-s increments and mel-spectrograms were computed. This technique is used to regularize models and provide more robust features.

It is worth noting that the common data augmentation techniques mentioned in the context of image classification, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, are not applicable in this specific pipeline as it deals with audio data. The technique used here is specific to audio data augmentation and is designed to increase the size of the training dataset.
