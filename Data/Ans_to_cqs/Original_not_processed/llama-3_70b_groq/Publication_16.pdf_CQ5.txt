Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses a bird classification system using visual and acoustic data, but it does not specify the exact datasets used for training and testing the model. It only mentions that the approach outlined in the paper will be compared with more advanced network architectures such as 1D CNN's in future work, and that the current study uses a limited range of species. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
