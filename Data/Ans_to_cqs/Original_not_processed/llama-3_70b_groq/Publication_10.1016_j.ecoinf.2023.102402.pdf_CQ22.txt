Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of a species distribution model using metrics such as the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). 

The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. The TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of â‰¤0 denote no better than random performance.

There is no mention of metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
