Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on data-driven models, hyperparameter tuning, and automated machine learning (AutoML) approaches. It discusses the importance of optimal hyperparameter selection, k-fold cross-validation, and the issue of overfitting in ML modeling, but it does not specify regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
