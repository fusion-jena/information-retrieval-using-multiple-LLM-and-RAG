Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a K-fold cross-validation technique was implemented, specifically a four-fold cross-validation. This involved dividing the dataset into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. Each fold served as the validation set, while the remaining three folds constituted the training set for model training. This process iterated four times with distinct validation sets. 

Additionally, to address imbalances in the dataset, random under sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set remained unchanged. This helped to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Furthermore, the study employed a K-fold cross-validation technique to overcome data limitations and enhance the robustness of the model training process. This method maximized the utilization of both on-site and RS datasets, integrating them comprehensively into both training and validation phases.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, the integration of both on-site and RS datasets suggests that the model was trained on a diverse range of data. However, it is not clear if the dataset was diverse in terms of other factors such as geographical location, time period, etc.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include K-fold cross-validation, stratified sampling, and random under sampling, as well as the integration of diverse datasets.
