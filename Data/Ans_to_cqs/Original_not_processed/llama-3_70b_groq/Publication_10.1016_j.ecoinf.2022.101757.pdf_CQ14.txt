Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the results of the model, including the R2 values, sample variance, and average absolute deviation, but it does not provide information on the optimization process. It is possible that the optimization method is not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
