Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various deep learning architectures and techniques, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and DeepLab, and their performance on specific tasks. It also mentions the training protocol used, including stochastic gradient descent with a momentum of 0.9 and a learning rate schedule.

Although the context does not explicitly mention regularization methods, it is likely that some form of regularization was used, as overfitting is a common problem in deep learning. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific regularization methods used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
