Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model's ability to learn from data, data analysis, and auditing procedures.

However, it can be inferred that the model outputs the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class, and analysts can sort the data accordingly. The context also highlights the auditing process, where analysts are presented with ranked pages containing visualizations of individual data samples. These visualizations include image cropping, contrast enhancement, and consecutive frame differences for images, and 2D spectrograms for audio data.

While the context does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps asked in the query, it implies that the model's output is used for further analysis and auditing. It is possible that metrics calculation and confusion matrix may be involved in the auditing process, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query directly, and it is unclear what specific postprocessing steps are involved after model training.
