Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses data sources and characteristics, as well as the results of an algorithm for identifying ecological source areas (ESAs). There is no mention of deep learning, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
