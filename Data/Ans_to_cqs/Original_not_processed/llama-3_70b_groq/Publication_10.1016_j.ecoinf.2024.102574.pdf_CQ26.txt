Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, forest conservation, and biomass estimation, with mentions of machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion, and neural networks. However, it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques specifically.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
