Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link. The context appears to be related to a research article on ecological informatics, specifically on pine wilt disease, and mentions various machine learning methods and R packages used in the study. However, it does not provide information on a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
