Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The text only mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. It does not provide any information about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
