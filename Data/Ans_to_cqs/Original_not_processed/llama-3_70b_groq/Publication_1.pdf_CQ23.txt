Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context focuses on the application of deep learning for large-scale biodiversity monitoring, highlighting the benefits of using deep learning algorithms and the availability of large amounts of labeled data. It does not provide details on the specific methods or techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
