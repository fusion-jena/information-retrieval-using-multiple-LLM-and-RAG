Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models, such as Cascade RCNN, on a wild bird recognition task, and mentions various challenges and limitations of the task, such as dataset noise and environmental clutter. It also presents benchmarking results during the training stage, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
