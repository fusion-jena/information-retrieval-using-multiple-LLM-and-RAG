Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks. However, it does not specify how the model determines when to stop training, such as through a validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
