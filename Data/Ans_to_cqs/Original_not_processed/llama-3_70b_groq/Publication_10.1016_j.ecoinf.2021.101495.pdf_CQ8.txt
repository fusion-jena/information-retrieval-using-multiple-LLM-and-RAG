Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the computing infrastructure, search strategy, and training duration of the neural networks, as well as the hyperparameters used for training. It also provides information about the dataset, data augmentation, and model architecture. However, it does not provide any information about where the code repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
