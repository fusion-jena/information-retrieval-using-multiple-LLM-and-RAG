Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses the use of EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, transfer learning, and weak supervision, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
