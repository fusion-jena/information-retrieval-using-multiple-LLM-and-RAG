Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on explaining the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method, its formulation, and its applications, as well as providing references to various studies that utilize SVR and other machine learning techniques. 

It does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
