Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, discussing the analysis of flux tower measurements in a pine-dominated ecosystem using a Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach. It does not provide any information about deep learning or randomness handling strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
