Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of research studies, including a study on acoustic monitoring of wildlife in the Brazilian Pantanal. The text mentions the use of R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
