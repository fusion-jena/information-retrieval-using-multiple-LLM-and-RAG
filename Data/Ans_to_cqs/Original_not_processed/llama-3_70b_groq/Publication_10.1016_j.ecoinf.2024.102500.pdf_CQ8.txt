Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models for water quality prediction, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
