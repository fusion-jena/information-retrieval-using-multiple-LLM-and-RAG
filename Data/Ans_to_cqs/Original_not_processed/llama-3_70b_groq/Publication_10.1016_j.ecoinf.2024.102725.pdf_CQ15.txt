Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and image processing, discussing topics like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) profiles, image synthesis, and accuracy evaluation metrics. There is no mention of deep learning optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
