Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset is annotated using semantic segmentation, where each image contains the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes. This is mentioned in section 4.2.1, where it is stated that "a semantic segmentation is conducted using our previous works [51-53]. The four classes—namely, urban, bare soil, vegetation and road—are extracted from the satellite images..."

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data annotation technique used is semantic segmentation.
