Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning models to predict diving behavior in seabirds using GPS data, and it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
