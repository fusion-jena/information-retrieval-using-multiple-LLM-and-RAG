Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The section 3.4 discusses the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping, but it only mentions that the training ratio started from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%, without providing the criteria for splitting the data. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
