Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be discussing Bayesian networks (BNs) and their application to permafrost modeling, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
