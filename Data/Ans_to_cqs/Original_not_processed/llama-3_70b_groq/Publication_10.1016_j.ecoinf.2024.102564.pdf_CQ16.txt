Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the configuration of the Random Forest (RF) model, the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, and the k-fold cross-validation method used to assess the model's performance. However, it does not mention any specific criteria, such as validation loss plateau, to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
