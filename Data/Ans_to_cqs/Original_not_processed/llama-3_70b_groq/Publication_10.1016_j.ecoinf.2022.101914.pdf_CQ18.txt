Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a common approach to split the data into evaluation and training datasets prior to training the models, and set aside the evaluation dataset to evaluate individual averaged modeling approaches and the final ensemble models. 

Additionally, it is mentioned that the authors calculated the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) for each model using the external evaluation datasets set aside prior to training models. This suggests that the authors used these metrics to evaluate the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on how they monitored the model performance during training.
