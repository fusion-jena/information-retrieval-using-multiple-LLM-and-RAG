Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of hyperparameters in deep learning models, the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, and its application in fine-tuning LSTM models. It also includes references to various research papers and articles, but none of them provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
