Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially specified in the provided context. According to Section 2.2.6, the optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned. Additionally, other hyper-parameter settings for model training are mentioned to be shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information, but this table is not provided in the given context. Therefore, we cannot determine the learning rate and other hyperparameters from the given information.
