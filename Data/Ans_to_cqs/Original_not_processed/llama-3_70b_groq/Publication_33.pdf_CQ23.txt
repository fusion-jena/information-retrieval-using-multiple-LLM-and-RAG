Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is trained on a database T0 (Fig. 2a) and then tuned on a second and independent database T1 (Fig. 2b). This suggests that the authors may have used a form of data splitting, where the model is trained on one dataset and evaluated or fine-tuned on another dataset. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability.

However, it is not clear if the datasets T0 and T1 are diverse, stratified, or if cross-validation was used. The context does not provide enough information to determine the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
