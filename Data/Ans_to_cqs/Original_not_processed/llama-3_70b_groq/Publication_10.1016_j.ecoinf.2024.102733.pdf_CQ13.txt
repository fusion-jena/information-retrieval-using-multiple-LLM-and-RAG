Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include:

* Learning rate: Various values were explored, including 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1.
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer was used, along with a scheduler that adjusts the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau.
* Batch size: Different batch sizes were tested, including 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 8192.
* Weight decay: Values ranged from 0 to 0.59, with specific values including 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.001.
* Dropout: Values ranged from 0.05 to 0.25.
* Focal loss parameters: α was defined as the inverse of class frequency, or set to 0.25 or 0.5, while γ was set to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, or 2.
* Latent dimension: Values included 128, 256, 512, and 2048.

Note that these hyperparameters were explored and evaluated in different combinations to assess the model's performance.
