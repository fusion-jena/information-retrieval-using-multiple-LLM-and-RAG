Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, acoustic data, and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
