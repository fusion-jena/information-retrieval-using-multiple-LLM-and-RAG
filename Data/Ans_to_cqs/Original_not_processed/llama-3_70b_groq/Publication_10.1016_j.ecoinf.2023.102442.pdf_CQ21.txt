The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model parameters, the process of selecting training sites, and the reclassification method, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
