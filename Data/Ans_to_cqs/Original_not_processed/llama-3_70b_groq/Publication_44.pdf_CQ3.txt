Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the input images were resized to a 512 Ã— 512 resolution along with their annotation, but it does not specify the type of annotation used. 

However, based on the fact that the DeepLabv3+ model was used for semantic segmentation, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used might be pixel-level annotation, where each pixel in the image is labeled as either "leaf" or "background". This is because semantic segmentation tasks typically involve assigning a class label to each pixel in an image.

But, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether other annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used.
