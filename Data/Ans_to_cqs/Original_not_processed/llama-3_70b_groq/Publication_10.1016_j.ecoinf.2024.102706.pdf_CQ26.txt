Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the differences between Random Forest and gradient boosting models, specifically LightGBM and XGBoost, and their tree growth strategies.

However, it does mention that LightGBM employs a unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling (GBOSS), which excludes data with small gradients while utilizing the remainder for estimating information gain and facilitating tree growth. This method might be related to addressing data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

The context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
