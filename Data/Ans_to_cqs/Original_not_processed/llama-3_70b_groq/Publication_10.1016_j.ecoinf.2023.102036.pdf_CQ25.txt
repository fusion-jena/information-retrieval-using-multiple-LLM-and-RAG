Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. It mentions that deep learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on a learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the architectural characteristics of the brain, and that it consists of processing units that specialize in detecting certain hidden characteristics in the data. It also mentions that computer vision is being applied in the field of fisheries, but it does not specify the exact purpose of the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
