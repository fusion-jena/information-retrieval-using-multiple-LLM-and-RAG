Answer: 

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The machine learning algorithms mentioned are RF (Random Forest), ANN (Artificial Neural Network), and GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree). The ANN model is described as having no intermediate layers, with the input layer followed by the output layer. This suggests a simple feedforward neural network, but not a specific type of deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
