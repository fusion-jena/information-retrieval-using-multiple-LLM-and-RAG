Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and climate data, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

The context mentions BIOCLIM variables, which are a set of climate variables used in species distribution modeling. These variables are likely derived from climate data, but the context does not specify how the climate data was collected. It is possible that the climate data was obtained from public datasets, sensors, or other sources, but this information is not provided.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
