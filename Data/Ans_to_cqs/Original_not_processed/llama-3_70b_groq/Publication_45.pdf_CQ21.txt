Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the integration of deep learning-based submodels into process-based modeling frameworks for advancing ecological understanding and provides a brief overview of deep neural networks, including the training phase and network architecture.

However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning applications to perform postprocessing steps after model training, such as:

* Calculating metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate the model's performance
* Generating saliency maps to visualize the importance of input features
* Creating a confusion matrix to assess the model's classification performance
* Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
* Model interpretation and explainability techniques to understand the model's decision-making process

These steps are essential to ensure the model's reliability, interpretability, and generalizability. However, since the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps, I cannot provide more specific information on the postprocessing steps involved in this particular context.
