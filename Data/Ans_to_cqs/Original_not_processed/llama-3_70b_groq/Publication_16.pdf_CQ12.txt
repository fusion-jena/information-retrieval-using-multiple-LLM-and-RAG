Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is mentioned in the context where it is stated that "CNN approaches require a large corpus of high-quality annotated data that can be used to train the network." This implies that the authors are using a CNN-based approach for species classification.
