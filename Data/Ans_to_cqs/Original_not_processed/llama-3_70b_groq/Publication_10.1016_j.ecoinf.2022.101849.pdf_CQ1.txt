Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various terms used to describe weakly supervised learning tasks, such as weak labels, partial labels, and distribution learning. The context also mentions a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, but it does not provide information on the methods used to collect raw data for this task.

The references cited in the context are related to machine learning, vegetation modeling, and image segmentation, but they do not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
