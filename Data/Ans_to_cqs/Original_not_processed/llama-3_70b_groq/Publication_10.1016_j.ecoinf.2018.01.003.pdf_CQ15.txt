Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the history and applications of neural networks, as well as some specific neural network models and their variations.

However, it does mention an "improved BCO approach" in the context of weights optimization of neural networks (Zhang and Wu, 2008), but it does not provide further details about this approach or its relation to deep learning optimization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
