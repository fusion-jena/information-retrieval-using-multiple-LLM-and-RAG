Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and the MLPnn-MC model used for LULC classification and simulation. It discusses the model's architecture, parameters, and performance but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
