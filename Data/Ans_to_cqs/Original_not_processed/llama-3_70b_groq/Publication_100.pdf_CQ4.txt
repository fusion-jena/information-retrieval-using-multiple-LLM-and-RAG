Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only describes the model architecture, implementation details, and the process of sampling reference data patches for training. It does not provide information on any data augmentation techniques used to increase the diversity of the training data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
