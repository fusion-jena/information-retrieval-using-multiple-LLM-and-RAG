Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the dataset and its composition. 

The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set having 541, 802, 825, 769, and 880 points for scenes S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively. The test set has 222, 344, 353, 324, and 382 points for the same scenes. The complete dataset has 463, 707, 728, 679, and 784 points for the respective scenes.

Although the context does not provide the specific criteria used for splitting the data, it can be inferred that the split is based on the scenes (S1 to S5) and the number of points in each scene. However, the exact method or ratio used for splitting the data into training and test sets is not specified.
