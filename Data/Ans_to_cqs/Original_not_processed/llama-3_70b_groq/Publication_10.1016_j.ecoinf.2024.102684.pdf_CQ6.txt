Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The text focuses on the architecture of the fully connected network, hyperparameter search, and data augmentation techniques applied to the training data. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors might have performed some preprocessing steps, as they mention applying modifications to the original images, such as rotation, horizontal flip, vertical flip, width shift range, height shift range, shear range, zoom range, and brightness range, as part of their data augmentation techniques. 

But, the context does not provide specific information about any preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, that might have been performed on the data before training the model.
