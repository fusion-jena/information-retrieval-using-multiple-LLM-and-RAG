Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on active learning, dimensionality reduction, and the application of deep neural networks to large datasets. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention that deep neural networks are frequently used for dimensionality reduction, and the input to a deep network often has many values, but layers typically get smaller throughout the network. This implies that some form of preprocessing or feature engineering might be necessary to prepare the data for training a deep learning model. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common practices in machine learning and deep learning. These steps help to prepare the data for training by reducing the effect of feature scaling, handling missing values, and removing noise or outliers. However, without explicit information in the context, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
