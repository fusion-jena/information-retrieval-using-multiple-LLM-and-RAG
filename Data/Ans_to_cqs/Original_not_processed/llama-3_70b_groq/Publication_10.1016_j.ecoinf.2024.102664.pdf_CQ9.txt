Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of hybrid deep learning models for algal blooms forecasting from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery. The article provides information on the methodology, results, and discussion, but it does not mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
