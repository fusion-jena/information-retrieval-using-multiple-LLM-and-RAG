Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, but it does not specify the framework used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
