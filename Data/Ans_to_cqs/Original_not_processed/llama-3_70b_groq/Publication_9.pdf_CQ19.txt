Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs, ImageNet, and stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation, but it does not specify a particular framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
