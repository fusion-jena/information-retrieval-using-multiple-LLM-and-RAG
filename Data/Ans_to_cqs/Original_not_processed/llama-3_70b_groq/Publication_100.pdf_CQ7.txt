Answer::: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on geographical division. The ALS project is divided into horizontal stripes of width 900 pixels (9.0 km). Within each stripe, the northernmost 5.4 km is assigned to the training set, the next 1.8 km is assigned to the validation set, and the southernmost 1.8 km is assigned to the test set. This ensures that the different regions and modalities in each ALS area are evenly distributed between the three sets, following the '60-20-20' ratio often used in machine learning studies.
