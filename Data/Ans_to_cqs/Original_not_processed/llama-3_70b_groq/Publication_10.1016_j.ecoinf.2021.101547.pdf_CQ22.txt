Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text explains the process of training a CNN, including the use of mini-batches, the estimation of class probabilities, and the computation of a 'loss' score. However, it does not specify the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
