Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forest models, but not deep learning models. Therefore, it does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the GLMs and Random Forest models. These metrics include:

* Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
* Percent Correctly Classified (PCC)
* Sensitivity
* Specificity
* True Skill Statistic (TSS)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting the presence or absence of felids at different scales.
