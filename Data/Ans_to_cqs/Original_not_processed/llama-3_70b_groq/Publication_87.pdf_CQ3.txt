Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that the deep learning model is trained on a dataset of labelled images and makes predictions on a new dataset of unlabelled images. It does not provide details on how the images were labelled or annotated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
