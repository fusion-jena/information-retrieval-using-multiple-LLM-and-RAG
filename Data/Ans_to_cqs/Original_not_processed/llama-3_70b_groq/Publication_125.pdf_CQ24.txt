Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on privacy-preserving deep learning for satellite image classification, discussing techniques like homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and secure multi-party computation. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
