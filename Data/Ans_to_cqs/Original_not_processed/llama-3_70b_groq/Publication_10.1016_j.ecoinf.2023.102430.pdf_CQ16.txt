Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the maximum number of epochs for the AN algorithm was set to 15 after preliminary tests. This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau. 

It's possible that the authors used a different criterion, but it's not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
