Answer::: 
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is trained to identify red kite images from a dataset of social media images. The model is evaluated based on its performance on an independent test set of 2060 images, with 950 of them being true positive red kite images. The model's performance is measured by its training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. The model is used to identify further relevant sightings in a social media dataset using both textual metadata and image content.
