Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of a Random Forest model and a Deep Neural Network model for a specific task, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques such as dropout and batch normalization in the Deep Neural Network model, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities. These techniques can indirectly help mitigate the effects of randomness in the model, but they are not specifically designed to handle randomness in the pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as data augmentation, and implementing regularization methods. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
