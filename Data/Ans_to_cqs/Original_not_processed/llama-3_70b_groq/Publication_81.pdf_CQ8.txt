Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the application of a novel deep learning method, ESK model, for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. The paper presents the methodology, results, and discussion, but it does not provide information about the code repository or where the implementation of the ESK model can be found.
