Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, class creation, and classification pipeline, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated based on the regression scores obtained from the SVM classifier. The context mentions that "over 85% of backgrounds thumbnails have a regression score lesser than 0.5, and 85% of fishes thumbnails have a regression score greater than 0.5", which suggests that the model performance is being evaluated based on these scores. But the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned.
