Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The section "3.3 Towards deploying the model in the field" does not provide any information about the deployment process. It only mentions the hardware specifications of the system used for training, but it does not discuss the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as the necessary information is not provided in the given context.
