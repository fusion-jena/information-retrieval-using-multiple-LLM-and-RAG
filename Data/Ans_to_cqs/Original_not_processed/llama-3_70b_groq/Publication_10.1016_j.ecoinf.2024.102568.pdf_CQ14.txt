Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides references to various papers and conferences related to optimization, spatial interpolation, and machine learning, but it does not specify the optimization method used for the model's hyperparameters.

The context does mention "parameters optimization" in the title of a conference paper, but it does not provide further details on the optimization method used. It also mentions Adam, a stochastic optimization method, but it is not clear if this method is used for hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
