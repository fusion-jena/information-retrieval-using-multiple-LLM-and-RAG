Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing forest fires, machine learning, and cellular automata, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The text mentions various references and citations, but none of them point to a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
