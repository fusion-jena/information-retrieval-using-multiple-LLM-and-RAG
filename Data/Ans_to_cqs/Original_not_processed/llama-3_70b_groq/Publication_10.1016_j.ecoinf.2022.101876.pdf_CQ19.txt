Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of Faster R-CNN, which is a type of object detection algorithm, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Faster R-CNN can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which one was used in this particular case.
