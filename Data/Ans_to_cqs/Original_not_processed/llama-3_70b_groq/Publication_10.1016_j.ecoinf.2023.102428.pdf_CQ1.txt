Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from public datasets and remote sensing sources. Specifically, the context mentions EarthExplorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/21.84/82.79) as sources of data. These platforms provide access to satellite imagery and other geospatial data that can be used for land use/land cover (LULC) classification, which is the focus of the study.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. The context suggests that the study relies on existing datasets and remote sensing sources to gather the necessary data for the deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used to collect raw data. However, based on the mention of EarthExplorer and OpenStreetMap, it can be inferred that remote sensing and public datasets are the primary sources of data for the study.
