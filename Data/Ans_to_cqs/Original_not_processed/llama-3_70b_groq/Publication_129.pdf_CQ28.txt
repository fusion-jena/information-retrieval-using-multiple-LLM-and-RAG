Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the study uses a cloud computing system, but it does not specify which cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) was used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the available information.
