Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ. The RTMSPE is used to remove the impact of heterogeneous observations.

It can be inferred that the training process might be considered complete when the RTMSPE converges or reaches a minimum value, indicating that the model has found the optimal values for the tuning parameters. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of cross-validation, which is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and determine when training is complete. However, it does not specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of cross-validation.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and it is unclear what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
