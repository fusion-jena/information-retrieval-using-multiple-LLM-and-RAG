Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the learning algorithm is usually stochastic gradient descent, which implies that the training process involves optimization of a loss function.

In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include convergence of the loss function, validation loss plateau, or reaching a desired level of accuracy on a validation set. However, these specific criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
