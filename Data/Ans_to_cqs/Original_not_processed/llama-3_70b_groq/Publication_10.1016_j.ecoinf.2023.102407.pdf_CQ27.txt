Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on species distribution prediction, invasive species, and the proposal of a novel scheme called SDP-EPL, which is based on an ensemble teacher model to incrementally generate pseudo-labels. It discusses the training process of the SDP-EPL model but does not provide information on how to deploy the trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
