Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning ensemble predictions to model the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls, and it discusses the importance of predictors, model diagnostics, and partial dependence plots. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

It is possible that the authors of the article may have discussed these measures in other sections of the paper, but based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
