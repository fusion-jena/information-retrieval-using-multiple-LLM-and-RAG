Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation (DA) as a technique to overcome the overfitting problem. Data augmentation is a method to artificially increase and diversify the training data by creating modified copies of the existing dataset. This can help prevent overfitting by providing more diverse training data.

The context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
