Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to permafrost and soil properties, with variables such as thaw depth, soil density, and vegetation height. There is no mention of data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
