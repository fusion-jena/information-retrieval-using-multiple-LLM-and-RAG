Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that "the weights in the output layer of the CNN were randomly initialised" during the execution of the experiments. This suggests that randomness was introduced in the model's initialization, but it is not clear if any measures were taken to control or reproduce this randomness.

Additionally, the context mentions that the datasets were split into training and testing sets by randomly selecting entire audio files, but it does not provide information on how this randomness was handled or if any efforts were made to ensure reproducibility.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as setting a random seed value, using fixed shuffling of data, or using reproducible random number generators to handle randomness and ensure reproducibility of results. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
