Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are Sensitivity and Specificity. These metrics are presented in Table 1, which shows the performance metrics obtained using the test data. The table lists the Sensitivity and Specificity values for each species, with the best performing class being the Eurasian Collared Dove and the worst performing class being the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. 

Additionally, the context also mentions accuracy as a performance metric, which is reported as 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
