Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are GPS devices and Time-Depth Recorder (TDR) devices. These devices are used to collect data on the behavior of seabirds, specifically shags, guillemots, and razorbills. The GPS devices collect location data, while the TDR devices record dive profiles, including the maximum depths reached by the birds. The combination of these two data sources is used to train deep neural networks to predict the diving behavior of the seabirds.
