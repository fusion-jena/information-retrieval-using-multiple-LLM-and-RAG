Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the validation loss. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored through the validation loss, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly to avoid overfitting and improve convergence.
