Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be discussing the use of convolutional neural networks for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs, as well as the limitations of image-based methods and the importance of representing spatial attributes in 3D models for landscape planning. However, it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline.
