Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the deep learning approaches require initial ground-truth datasets consisting of annotated images, which are used to train a model.

It is mentioned that creating accurate annotated imagery for training can be time-consuming, and new tools are being developed to assist in the annotation of ground-truth images, such as v7 labs and AnyLabeling. These tools utilize artificial intelligence to aid in the annotation process, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
