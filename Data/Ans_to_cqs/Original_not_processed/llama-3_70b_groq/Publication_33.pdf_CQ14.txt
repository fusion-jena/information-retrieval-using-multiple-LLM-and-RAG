Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context primarily focuses on the calibration of the Deep Learning model using a single parameter for all classes and the tuning of risk thresholds specific to each class. It also discusses the classification model's performance with and without post-processing. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
