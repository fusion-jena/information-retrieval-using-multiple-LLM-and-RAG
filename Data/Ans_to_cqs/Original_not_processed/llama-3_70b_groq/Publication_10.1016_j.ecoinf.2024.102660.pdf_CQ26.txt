Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. 

However, it is mentioned that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 1232:176:356 image pairs, respectively. This suggests that the data is split in a way that maintains a similar distribution of classes in each set, which could help mitigate data bias to some extent. 

But, there is no explicit mention of techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were used in this specific study.
