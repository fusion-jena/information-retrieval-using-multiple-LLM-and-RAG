Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing remote sensing image data, specifically a GF-1 remote sensing image with 8-m multi-spectral bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared). The data underwent various processing steps, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, image registration, image fusion, and mosaic cropping. However, it does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
