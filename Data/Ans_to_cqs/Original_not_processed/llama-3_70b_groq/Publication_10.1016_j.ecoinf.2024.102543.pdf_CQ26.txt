Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that augmentation played a crucial role in further diversifying the dataset, which could help mitigate data bias to some extent. Specifically, random saturation adjustments were introduced to each training example, increasing the number of outputs per example to two and contributing to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset.

While this augmentation strategy can help increase the diversity of the dataset, it is not a direct technique used to address data bias. The context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection that are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
