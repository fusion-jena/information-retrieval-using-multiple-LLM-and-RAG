Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context only discusses the configuration of random forest (RF) training parameters, such as the number of trees, division variables, and node size, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
