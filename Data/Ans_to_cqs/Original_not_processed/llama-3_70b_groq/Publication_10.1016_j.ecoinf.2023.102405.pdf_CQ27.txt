Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process of the AODEGRU model, including the initialization of the model, defining the loss function and optimizer, and the training loop. It also provides some background information on the research topic of water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture using deep learning-based AODEGRU. However, it does not provide any information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
