Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to forest fires, machine learning, and model evaluation, but it does not provide information on training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
