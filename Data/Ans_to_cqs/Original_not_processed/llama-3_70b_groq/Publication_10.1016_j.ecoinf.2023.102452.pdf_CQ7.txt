Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be focused on various topics such as entropy maximization, neural networks, genetic programming, and signal analysis, but it does not provide specific information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
