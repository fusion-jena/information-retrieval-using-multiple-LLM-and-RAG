Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research article about forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods. It provides information about the authors, affiliations, and references, but does not discuss the data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
