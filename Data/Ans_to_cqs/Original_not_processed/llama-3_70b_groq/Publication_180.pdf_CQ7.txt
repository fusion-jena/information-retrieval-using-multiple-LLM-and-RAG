Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the default setting for validation percentage was 10%, which was increased to 16% due to the limited number of images available for some species. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria for this split are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions a leave-one-out cross-validation approach for evaluation, where one image from each species in a country is left out to evaluate the model. This implies that the data was split into training and testing sets, but again, the exact criteria for this split are not provided.

In summary, while the context provides some information about data splitting, it does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
