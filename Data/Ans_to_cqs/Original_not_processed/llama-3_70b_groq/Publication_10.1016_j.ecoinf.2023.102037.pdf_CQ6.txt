Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the images were sliced into smaller tiles of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) to maintain their original pixel dimensions, which is especially important for detecting small insects. This step can be considered as a form of data preprocessing, but it does not provide information about other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, apart from the image tiling step mentioned.
