Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to land cover classification using different machine learning algorithms (MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF) and evaluating their performance using metrics such as overall accuracy and kappa index. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
