Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to be discussing a different topic, possibly related to information theory and network analysis. It mentions concepts like transfer entropy, mutual information, and lagged information, but does not provide any information about deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
