Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing applications, atmospheric corrections, and land use/land cover classifications, but it does not provide specific information about the deep learning model's generalizability measures.

However, it can be inferred that the use of multi-sensor satellite data and fused data sources might contribute to the diversity of the dataset. Additionally, the consideration of varying pixel sizes of water bodies at different resolutions might help in making the model more adaptable to different scenarios. Nevertheless, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
