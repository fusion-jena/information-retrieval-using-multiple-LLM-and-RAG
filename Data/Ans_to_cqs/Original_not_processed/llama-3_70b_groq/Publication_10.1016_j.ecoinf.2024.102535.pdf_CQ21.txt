Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process, including the batch size, early stopping procedure, data augmentation, and network architectures. It also presents the performance metrics of the models, but it does not elaborate on how these metrics were calculated or what other postprocessing steps were involved.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as whether saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices were used.
