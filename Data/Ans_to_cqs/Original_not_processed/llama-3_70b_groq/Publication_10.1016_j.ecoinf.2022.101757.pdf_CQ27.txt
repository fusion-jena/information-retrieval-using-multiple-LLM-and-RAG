Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset, and that the model was used for inference without training it directly on the landscape photos. There is no information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.
