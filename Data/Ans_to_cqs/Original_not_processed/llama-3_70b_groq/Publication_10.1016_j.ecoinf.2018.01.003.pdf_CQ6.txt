Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the history and development of neural networks, deep learning, and various applications of artificial neural networks in different fields. It does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include data cleaning, feature scaling, normalization, handling missing values, and data transformation, among others. The specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In the absence of explicit information in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
