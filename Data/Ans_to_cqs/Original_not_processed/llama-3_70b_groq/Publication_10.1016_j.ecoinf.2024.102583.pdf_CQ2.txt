Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The context seems to focus on landslide susceptibility mapping and mentions various machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), but does not specify the data formats used.

However, it can be inferred that the data might be in a tabular format, such as CSV, given the mention of features like distance to stream, land cover, lithology, and distance to road, which are typical attributes used in geographic information systems (GIS). Additionally, the context mentions "pending data availability," which suggests that the data might be in a format that can be easily processed and analyzed.

It is also possible that the data might be in a spatial format, such as shapefiles or GeoTIFF, given the focus on landslide susceptibility mapping and the mention of geographic features like streams and roads. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
