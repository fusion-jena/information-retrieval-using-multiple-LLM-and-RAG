Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the annotation process, inter-annotator variability, and aggregation methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the evaluation of their performance on different annotation sets, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
