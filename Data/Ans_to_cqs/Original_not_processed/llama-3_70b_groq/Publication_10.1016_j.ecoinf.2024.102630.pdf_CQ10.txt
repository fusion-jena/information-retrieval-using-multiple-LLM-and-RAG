Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the use of remote sensing data and various NDVI datasets. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
