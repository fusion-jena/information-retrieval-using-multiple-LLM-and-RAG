Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various deep learning models and techniques, including U2-Net and TrunkNet, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not seem to be related to a specific data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
