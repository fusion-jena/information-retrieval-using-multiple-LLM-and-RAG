Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in wildlife surveys, camera trap images, and the use of AlexNet model. It discusses the model architecture, activation functions, and pooling methods, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
