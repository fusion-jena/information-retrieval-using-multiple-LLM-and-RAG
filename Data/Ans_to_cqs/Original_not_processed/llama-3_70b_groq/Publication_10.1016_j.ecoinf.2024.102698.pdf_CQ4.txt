Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the use of deep learning methods, specifically Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to generate synthetic data for coral cover and connectivity. It discusses the architecture and training process of these models, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
