Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The context discusses the architecture of the CNN model, the different layers used, and the techniques employed, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the model. It could be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this.
