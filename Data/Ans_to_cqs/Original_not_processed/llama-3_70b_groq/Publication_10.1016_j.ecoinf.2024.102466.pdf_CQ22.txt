Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are Average Precision (AP) and mean Average Precision (mAP). 

AP is divided into three distinct ranges: APs, APm, and APl, which correspond to varying pixel sizes of the bird instance and denote average precision for small, medium, and large size targets. 

The results indicate that the Cascade RCNN model outperformed other models at each training stage, and the mAP scores were used to compare the performance of different models. 

However, it does not mention other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
