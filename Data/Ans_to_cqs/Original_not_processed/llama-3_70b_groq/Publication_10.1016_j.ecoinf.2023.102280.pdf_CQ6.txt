Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that clean data is collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input data and a "denoised" ground truth. This suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing is involved, but the specific steps are not detailed.

Additionally, the context mentions that spectral subtraction is used to remove noise from the signal and then superimpose randomly sampled noise onto the ground-truth to generate the noisy input. This could be considered a preprocessing step, but it is specific to generating the training data and not a general preprocessing step for deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
