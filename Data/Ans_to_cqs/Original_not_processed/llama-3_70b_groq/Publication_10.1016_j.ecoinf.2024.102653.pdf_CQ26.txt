Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is stratified splitting. This is evident from the statement "Individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between these subsets, guaranteeing a balanced representation of each class." This suggests that the data was split into training and testing subsets in a way that maintained the same class balance in both subsets, which is a characteristic of stratified splitting.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of cross-validation for imbalanced datasets, which is a related concept, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique used in this specific pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, stratified splitting is the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
