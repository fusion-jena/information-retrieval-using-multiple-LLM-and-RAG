Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. This is mentioned in the introduction section, where it is stated that "more recent methods, such as 'Faster R-CNN' (Ren et al., 2015), and YOLO (Redmon et al., 2016) consider both problems at the same time." Additionally, the context provides a link to the YOLOv5 repository on GitHub, which further supports the conclusion that a YOLO model is used.
