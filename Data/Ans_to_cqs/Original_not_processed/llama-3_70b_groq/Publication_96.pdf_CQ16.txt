Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the parameters defined for the training phase, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of interactions, as well as the input data and spectral bands used for classification. It also discusses the results of the algorithm, including the accuracy and errors, but does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, in this particular case.
