Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from images of plants. The context mentions two datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200, which are used to train and evaluate deep learning models for plant species identification. 

However, the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting these images. It is possible that the images were collected online, as mentioned in one of the references [20], but this is not explicitly stated for the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting the raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
