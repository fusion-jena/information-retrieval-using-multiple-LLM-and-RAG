Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through citizen science surveys using acoustic devices. Specifically, the data was collected as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) between 2005-2011, where citizen scientists recorded full-spectrum time-expanded (TE) ultrasonic acoustic data along road-transects using devices such as the Tranquility Transect (Courtplan Design Ltd, UK). These devices were set to record using a TE factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and sensitivity set on maximum, resulting in a continuous sequence of 'snapshots' consisting of 320ms of silence and 3.2s of TE audio. This method allowed for the collection of a large quantity of raw audio data, including instances of low-amplitude and faint bat calls, as well as other night-time background noises.
