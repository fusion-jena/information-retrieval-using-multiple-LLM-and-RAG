Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or number of epochs. The context focuses on the overall methodology of using deep learning models for land-cover classification, the importance of labeling data, and the application of the U-Net model for image classification. It also discusses the preparation of training and validation data, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
