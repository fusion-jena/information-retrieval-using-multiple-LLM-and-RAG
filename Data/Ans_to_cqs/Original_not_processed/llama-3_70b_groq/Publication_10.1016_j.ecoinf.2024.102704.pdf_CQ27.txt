Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the importance of reducing memory access to improve model performance, a specific experiment conducted on a Windows 10-based mobile laptop with a GeForce RTX3080 GPU, and the results of the experiment. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
