Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the implementation details of the model, including the architecture, hyperparameters, and training process. It does not provide information on the dataset used for training and testing, or any techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
