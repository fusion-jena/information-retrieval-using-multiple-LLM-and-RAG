Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics are mentioned in the provided context as the evaluation metrics for the forecasting models. Specifically, the context states that the TPEBO-LSTM model achieved a 70.56% decrease in MAE and a 64.50% reduction in RMSE compared to the ARIMA model.
