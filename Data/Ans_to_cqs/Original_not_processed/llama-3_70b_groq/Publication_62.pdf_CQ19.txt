Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the code used to define and train the CNNs can be found in Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4). This suggests that Mathematica is used to build and train the deep learning models, rather than popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
