Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study on earth system science, and it discusses various models, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
