Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution, and environmental factors, with references to papers on topics such as drought tolerance, bioclimatic datasets, and Neolithic transitions. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
