Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different CNN architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of transfer learning to improve the model's performance.

However, it can be inferred that the authors are aware of the importance of having a sufficient amount of training data to avoid overfitting, as mentioned in the context. This suggests that they might have considered techniques to address data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this particular context.
