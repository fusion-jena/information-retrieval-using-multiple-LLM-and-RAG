Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is inferred from the mention of "Deep semantic segmentation of natural and medical images" in the Taghanaki et al. (2021) paper, which suggests the use of CNNs for image segmentation tasks. Additionally, the mention of "Geo-localization based on CNN" in the Tang et al. (2022a) paper further supports this conclusion.

Furthermore, the context mentions "Deeplabv3+" which is a specific architecture of CNNs, commonly used for semantic image segmentation tasks. This is mentioned in the EcologicalInformatics70(2022)1017573 paper, which describes the use of Deeplabv3+ with COCO classes for image segmentation.

While the context does not explicitly mention other types of deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers, the repeated mentions of CNNs and specific CNN architectures like Deeplabv3+ suggest that CNNs are the primary deep learning model used in the pipeline.
