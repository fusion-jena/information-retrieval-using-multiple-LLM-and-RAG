Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and text related to species distribution models, machine learning, and ecological informatics. There is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
