Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the importance of resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, in producing accurate species distribution models (SDMs) and the advantages of using random forest algorithms. It does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention resampling techniques, which can be used to address data bias. Bootstrapping, for instance, can help reduce stochastic errors in estimation, which may be related to data bias. Nevertheless, the context does not explicitly discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
