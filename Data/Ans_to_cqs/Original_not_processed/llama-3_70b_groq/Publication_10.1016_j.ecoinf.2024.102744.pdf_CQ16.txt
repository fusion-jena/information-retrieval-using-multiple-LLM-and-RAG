Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various object detection and classification models, including YOLOv5, Faster RCNN, and custom classification networks. It discusses the use of focal loss, overlap samplers, and other techniques to improve model performance, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
