Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks)" which is used to create a high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images.
