Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically RGB images of 224x224x3 as inputs, which are actually color spectrograms of two-second durations. This is mentioned in the text where it says "The implemented architecture received RGB images of 224×224×3 as inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations..." 

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention audio-related tasks, such as bird species identification in soundscapes, and the use of datasets like Audio Set and VGG-Sound, which suggests that audio data might be used in some capacity. But in the specific pipeline described, image data formats are used.
