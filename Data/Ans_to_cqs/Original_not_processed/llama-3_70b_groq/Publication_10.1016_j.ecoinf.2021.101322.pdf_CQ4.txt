Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Rotations between 0 and 360 degrees
* Reflection by the vertical axis
* Vertical shifting by +/- 5 pixels

These augmentation techniques were applied to the entire training dataset. Additionally, standard image normalization for CNNs was applied, mapping the 8-bit pixel values to floating-point values between 0 and 1.
