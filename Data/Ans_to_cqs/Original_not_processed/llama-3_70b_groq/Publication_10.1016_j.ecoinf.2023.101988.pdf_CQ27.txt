Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the use of drones and acoustic monitoring for biodiversity research, particularly in bird species identification. While it mentions the use of deep learning in one of the references (Chalmers et al., 2021), it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
