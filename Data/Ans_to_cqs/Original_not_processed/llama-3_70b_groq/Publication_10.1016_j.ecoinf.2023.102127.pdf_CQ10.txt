Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be related to species distribution models and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository.
