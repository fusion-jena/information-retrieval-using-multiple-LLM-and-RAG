Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and a discussion about the use of GPU computing in ecology, with a focus on machine learning applications. While it mentions machine learning applications, such as image and audio classification, it does not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
