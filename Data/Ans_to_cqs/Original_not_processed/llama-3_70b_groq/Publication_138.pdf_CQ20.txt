Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the architecture and performance of various deep learning models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, and ResNet, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
