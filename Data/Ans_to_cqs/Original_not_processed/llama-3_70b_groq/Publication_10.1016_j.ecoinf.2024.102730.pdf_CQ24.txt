Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on vegetation studies, plant species identification, and the application of machine learning techniques in ecology and earth science. It discusses various machine learning models, including support vector machines, boosted tree ensembles, and artificial neural networks, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
