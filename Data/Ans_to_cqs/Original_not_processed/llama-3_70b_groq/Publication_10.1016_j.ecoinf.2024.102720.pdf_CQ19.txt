Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological research, with references to papers on topics such as ecosystem service value, food supply and demand, and environmental challenges. There is a mention of "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm" in the first line, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
