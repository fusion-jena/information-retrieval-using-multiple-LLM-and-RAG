Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on active learning, semi-supervised learning, and the performance of different classification models (ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT) on a dataset of possum vocalisations and noise sources. It discusses the use of fine-tuning, 2-shot, 2-way test accuracy, and the evaluation of model performance on the test set. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
