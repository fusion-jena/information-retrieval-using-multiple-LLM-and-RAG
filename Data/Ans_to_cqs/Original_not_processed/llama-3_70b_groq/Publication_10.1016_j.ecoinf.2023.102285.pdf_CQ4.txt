Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to various research papers and studies in different fields such as underwater object detection, bird surveys, human activity detection, and aerial survey count data. However, it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
