Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is for classification, specifically for the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora species in remote sensing images. The study aims to evaluate the hypothesis that applying phenological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. The experiment involves a comparison between a deep learning model (SAE) and a traditional machine learning model (SVM) with six different types of Landsat images. The goal is to determine which model performs better in classifying and detecting the invasive species.
