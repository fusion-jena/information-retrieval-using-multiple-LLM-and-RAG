Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the classification process, image representations, and the dataset used for training. It provides details on the pre-processing step, the architecture of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, and the dataset statistics. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
