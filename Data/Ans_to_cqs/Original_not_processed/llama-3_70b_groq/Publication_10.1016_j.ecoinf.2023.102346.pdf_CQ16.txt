Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the evaluation of model performance using various metrics (AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR) and the use of techniques like k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping to assess model accuracy. It also discusses the comparison of different machine learning algorithms and the use of ensemble modeling approaches. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
