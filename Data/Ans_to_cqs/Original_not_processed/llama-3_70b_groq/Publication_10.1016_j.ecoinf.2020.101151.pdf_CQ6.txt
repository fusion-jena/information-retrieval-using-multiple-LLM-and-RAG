Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be related to a different topic, discussing the nine-cell approach for predicting fire weather indices (FWI) and fine fuel moisture code (FFMC) with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km. It also mentions vegetation and human impact, but does not provide any information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
