Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of off-the-shelf components like Raspberry Pi, PiCamera, routers, switches, PCs, and graphics cards to build the system. While graphics cards can be used for deep learning model training, it is not explicitly stated in the context. Therefore, I don't know the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
