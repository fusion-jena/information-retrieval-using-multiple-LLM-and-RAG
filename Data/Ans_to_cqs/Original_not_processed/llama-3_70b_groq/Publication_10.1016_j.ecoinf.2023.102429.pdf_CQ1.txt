Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline are related to soil organic carbon quantification and total nitrogen (TN) estimation. 

From the references provided, it can be inferred that spectral data from spectrometers are used as the raw data. For instance, in the study by Bai et al. (2022), Vis-NIR spectral data were used to estimate soil organic carbon. Similarly, in the study by Bartholomeus et al. (2008), spectral reflectance-based indices were used for soil organic carbon quantification.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of ViewSpecPro and the Unscrambler for data pre-processing, which suggests that the raw data is collected using spectrometers. The spectral bars saved for each sample were 15, and the average value was taken as the spectral reflectance of the soil samples.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that sensors, specifically spectrometers, are the primary method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for soil organic carbon quantification and TN estimation.
