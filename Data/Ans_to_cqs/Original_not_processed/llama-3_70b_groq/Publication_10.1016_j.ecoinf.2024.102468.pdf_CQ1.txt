Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on whale vocalizations, feature extraction methods, and machine learning detectors, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data in this context likely consists of whale sound recordings, which may be collected using underwater sensors or audio recorders. Additionally, the mention of "whale sound recordings" and "ambient noise from geophonic and anthropogenic sources" suggests that the data may be collected from field recordings or surveys.

But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
