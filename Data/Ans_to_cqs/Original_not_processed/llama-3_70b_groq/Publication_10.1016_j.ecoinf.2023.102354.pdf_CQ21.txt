Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing drought characteristics, drought indices, and equations for calculating the percentage of regions experiencing drought, drought severity, and duration. It also mentions the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps involved after model training.
