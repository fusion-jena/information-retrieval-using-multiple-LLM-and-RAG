Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being used to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it is mentioned that the model was tested on 20 random iterations for each of the five feature types as a function of distance, which might provide some insight into the model's performance under different conditions. Additionally, the use of pre-trained models such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec2 might imply that the models were trained on large datasets, but the context does not provide further information on the datasets used.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
