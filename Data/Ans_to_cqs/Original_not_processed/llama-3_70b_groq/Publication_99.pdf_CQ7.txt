Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures for PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. It does mention the use of a validation set for model evaluation and saving the best model based on validation loss, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
