Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training and validation performance of the environmental condition model, including the classification pipeline, confusion matrix, and model architecture. 

However, it can be inferred that the calculation of performance metrics, such as the validation performance of the CNN model with respect to each of the six environmental conditions, is one of the postprocessing steps involved. The context also mentions the creation of a confusion matrix (Fig. 7 (b)), which is another common postprocessing step in machine learning model evaluation.

There is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps are involved in the model's postprocessing pipeline.
