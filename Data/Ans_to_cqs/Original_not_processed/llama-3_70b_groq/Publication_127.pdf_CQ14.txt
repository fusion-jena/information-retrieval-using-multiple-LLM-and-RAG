Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions that more details about the architectures, training methods, preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameters are in SI Appendix, Preprocessing and Training, but it does not provide the specific information about hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
