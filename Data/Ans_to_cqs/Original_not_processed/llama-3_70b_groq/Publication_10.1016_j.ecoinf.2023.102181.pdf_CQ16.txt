Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses different validation approaches, including out-of-bag validation, spatial leave-one-out cross-validation, and others, as well as their application to bagging and covariance-weighted bagging. It also presents results from simulations and comparisons of different validation methods. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
