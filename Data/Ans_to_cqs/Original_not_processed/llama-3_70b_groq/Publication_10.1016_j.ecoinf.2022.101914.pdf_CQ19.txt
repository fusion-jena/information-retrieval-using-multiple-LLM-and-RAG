Answer: The context does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it mentions that the models were built using the biomod2 package in R. The machine learning models mentioned are Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt), but it does not specify the framework used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
