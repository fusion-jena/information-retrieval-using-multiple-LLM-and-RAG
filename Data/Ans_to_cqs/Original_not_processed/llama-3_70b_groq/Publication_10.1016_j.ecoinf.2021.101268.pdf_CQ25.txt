Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is trained to classify images of leaves into one of the ten species of leaves in the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. The model takes an image of a leaf as input and outputs the species of the leaf. The authors of the paper fine-tune pre-trained models such as AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 on the dataset and evaluate their performance on classifying the leaf images. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify the species of a leaf from an image, which can be useful in forestry and conservation applications.
