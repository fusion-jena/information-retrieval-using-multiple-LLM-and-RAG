Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the model selection procedure, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the data was randomly partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets, which could help reduce bias to some extent. But it does not provide any information on whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
