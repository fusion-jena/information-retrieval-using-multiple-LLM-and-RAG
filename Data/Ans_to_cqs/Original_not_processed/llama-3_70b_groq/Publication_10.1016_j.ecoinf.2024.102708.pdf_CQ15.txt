Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text focuses on comparing object detection models (YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN) and their variants for detecting Pacific oysters, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
