Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the workflow of the study, the use of deep learning models for vegetation mapping, and the availability of the scripts and data. It does not provide information on how data bias was handled during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
