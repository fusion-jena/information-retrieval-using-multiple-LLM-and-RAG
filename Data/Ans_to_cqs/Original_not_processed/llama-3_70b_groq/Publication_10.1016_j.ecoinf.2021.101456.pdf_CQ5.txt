Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their application in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
