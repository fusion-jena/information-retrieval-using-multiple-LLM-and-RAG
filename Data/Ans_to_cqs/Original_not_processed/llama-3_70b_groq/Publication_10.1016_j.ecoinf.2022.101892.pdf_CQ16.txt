Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, loss function, and experimental results, but it does not provide information about the training process or the stopping criteria.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance on the validation set, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study.
