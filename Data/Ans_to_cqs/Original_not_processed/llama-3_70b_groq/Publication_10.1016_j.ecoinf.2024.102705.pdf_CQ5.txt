Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses the application of deep learning in image processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and computer vision, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in these applications. The references cited in the context are related to research papers and conferences, but they do not mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
