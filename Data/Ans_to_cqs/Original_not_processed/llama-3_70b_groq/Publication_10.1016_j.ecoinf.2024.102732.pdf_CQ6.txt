Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of integrating spectral bands with other variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-derived indices, to improve the prediction of above-ground biomass. This suggests that data preprocessing and feature engineering may be important steps in the machine learning workflow, but the specific steps involved are not mentioned.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
