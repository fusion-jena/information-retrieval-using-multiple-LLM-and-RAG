Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
