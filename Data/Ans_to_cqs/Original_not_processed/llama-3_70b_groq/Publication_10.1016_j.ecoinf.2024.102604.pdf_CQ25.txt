Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs) and correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces. It discusses various methods such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) for SDMs, but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of a deep learning model from the provided context.
