Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the context, the model is designed to predict whether plant species images belong to any of the 100 categories of plant species. This is evident in the sentence: "Using the reshape method, the input size of the LSTM layer becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time features, the model sorts the plant species images through a fully connected layer to predict whether they belong under any of the 100 categories of the plant species." This indicates that the model is intended for classification tasks, specifically to classify plant species images into their respective categories.
