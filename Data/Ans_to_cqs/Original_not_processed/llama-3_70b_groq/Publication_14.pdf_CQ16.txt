Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses various topics such as dropout, a novel method to reduce time investment when processing videos from camera trap studies, and a deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction. It also mentions the development of a software called DeepMeerkat and its application in ecology and evolution. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
