Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the CVIP100 dataset, which is a valuable resource for computer vision-related tasks and digital image processing, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions various references and citations, but it does not mention specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
