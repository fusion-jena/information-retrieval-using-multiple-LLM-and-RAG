Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on describing the indicators used to quantify the urban environment, such as greenness, openness, enclosure, and others, as well as the NLP model and HRNet model used for sentiment analysis and semantic segmentation, respectively. 

However, it is mentioned that a comparative analysis of the accuracy of different models (Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, LSTM, and CNN) was conducted, and the LSTM-CNN model outperformed the others in sentiment task analysis. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it is not explicitly stated. 

Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
