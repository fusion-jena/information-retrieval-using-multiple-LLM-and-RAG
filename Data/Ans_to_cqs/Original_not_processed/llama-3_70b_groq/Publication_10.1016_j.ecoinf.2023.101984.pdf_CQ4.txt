Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, discussing topics such as MaxEnt models, environmental variables, and vegetation types. There is no mention of deep learning or image processing, which are the typical domains where data augmentation techniques are applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
