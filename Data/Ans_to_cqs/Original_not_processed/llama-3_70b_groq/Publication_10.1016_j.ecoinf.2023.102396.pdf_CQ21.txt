Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and its application to time series data, including the calculation of distances and the use of dynamic programming to find the least cost path. There is no mention of model training or postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
