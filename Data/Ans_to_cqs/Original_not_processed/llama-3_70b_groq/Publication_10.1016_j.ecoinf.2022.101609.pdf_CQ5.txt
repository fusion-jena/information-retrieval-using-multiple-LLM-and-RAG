Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The study focuses on developing a deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, and it appears to use real-world data collected from the REVIS system for training and evaluation. The context mentions predicting pollutant concentration levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, but it does not specify the datasets used for this purpose. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
