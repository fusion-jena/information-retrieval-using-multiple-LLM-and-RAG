Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning models, including linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, for predicting forest canopy cover from satellite data. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of DCNN (deep convolutional neural networks) for semantic segmentation in a separate study, but it is not part of the pipeline being discussed. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
