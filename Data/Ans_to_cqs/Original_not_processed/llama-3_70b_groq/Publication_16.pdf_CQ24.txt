Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches for bird species classification using audio and visual data.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of dropout with a value of 50% in the first three layers of the MLP model to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting, which can be seen as a way to handle randomness in the model. But this is not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline through strategies like setting a random seed value.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
