Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the validation set is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization. This implies that the validation set is used as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting, but it does not specify other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
