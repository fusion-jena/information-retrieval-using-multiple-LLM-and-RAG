Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context discusses the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
