Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were constructed in R using H2O. H2O is an open-source machine learning platform that provides a range of algorithms, including deep learning. It does not rely on TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are popular deep learning frameworks. Instead, H2O has its own implementation of deep learning algorithms. Therefore, the answer is that H2O is used to build the deep learning model, but it does not use TensorFlow or PyTorch.
