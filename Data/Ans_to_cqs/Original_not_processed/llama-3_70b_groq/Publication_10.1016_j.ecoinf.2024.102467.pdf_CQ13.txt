Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and articles, but it does not provide detailed information about the hyperparameters used in a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
