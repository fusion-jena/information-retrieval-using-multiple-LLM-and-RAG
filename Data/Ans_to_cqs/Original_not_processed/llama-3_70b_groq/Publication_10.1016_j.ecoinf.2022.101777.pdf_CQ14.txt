Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. It appears to be a collection of unrelated data, including a list of seasons, dates, file names, and numerical values. There is no information about a model or its hyperparameters, let alone how they are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
