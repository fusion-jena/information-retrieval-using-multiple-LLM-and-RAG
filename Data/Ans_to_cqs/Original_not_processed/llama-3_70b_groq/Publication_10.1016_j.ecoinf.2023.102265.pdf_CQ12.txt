Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), specifically a ResNet-50 model. This is mentioned in the context as "We trialled three depths, ResNet-18, 50 and 101, and compared their training times and validation accuracies." and "The input to the network is an image of 224x224". The use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction and the input image size of 224x224 further confirms that the model is a CNN.
