Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are PlantNet, Google Search Image, and Portuguese Flora, as well as iNaturalist. The PlantNet dataset is used as the training dataset, which consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe. The Google Search Image dataset is created by automatically retrieving the top 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each of the 3680 labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset. The Portuguese Flora and iNaturalist datasets are used as external test datasets to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the model is initialized with pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale visual recognition challenge dataset.
