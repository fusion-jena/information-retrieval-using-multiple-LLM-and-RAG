Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image segmentation tasks, specifically in the context of remote sensing and ecological informatics. The input to the Unet model is a 512 Ã— 512 pixels image, and the Deeplabv3+ model also involves image processing. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. 

It is also possible that CSV files may be used for storing or processing metadata related to the images, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context. Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to be image formats, but the specific format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified.
