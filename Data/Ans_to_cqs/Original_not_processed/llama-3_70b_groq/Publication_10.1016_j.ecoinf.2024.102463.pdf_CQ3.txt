Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on explaining the architecture of a neural network, the difference between parameters and hyperparameters, and the HyperBand algorithm for optimizing hyperparameters. It also discusses specific hyperparameters for a CNN model, such as window size and number of filters. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
