Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, habitat analysis, and conservation, with references to machine learning techniques such as ensemble models, random forest, and generalized linear models. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
