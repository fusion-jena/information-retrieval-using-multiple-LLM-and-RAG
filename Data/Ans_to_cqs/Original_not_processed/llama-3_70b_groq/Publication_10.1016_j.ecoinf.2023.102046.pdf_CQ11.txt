Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models such as ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and CLIP, as well as references to research papers and publications. However, it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
