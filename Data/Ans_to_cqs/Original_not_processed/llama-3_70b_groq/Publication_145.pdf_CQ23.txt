Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the model's architecture, training process, and performance on a validation dataset, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

The context only mentions that the model was trained on a dataset and validated on a separate dataset with 1195 objects, but it does not provide details on how the datasets were constructed or split. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

In general, ensuring generalizability is crucial in deep learning, and common techniques include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and data augmentation. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which techniques were used in this specific case.
