Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text explains the K-fold cross-validation technique used for model training and validation, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for the training process. 

It is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance metrics, or a specified number of epochs to determine when training is complete. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used in this study to determine when training is complete.
