Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of validation data. As shown in Figure 9, the loss of the model is plotted against both the test and validation data during model training. This allows for the monitoring of the model's performance on unseen data (validation data) during training, which helps to identify if the model is overfitting or not. Additionally, the accuracy of the model is also plotted against both the train and validation data over 100 epochs, as shown in Figure 10. This provides a clear indication of the model's performance during training and helps to determine the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence.
