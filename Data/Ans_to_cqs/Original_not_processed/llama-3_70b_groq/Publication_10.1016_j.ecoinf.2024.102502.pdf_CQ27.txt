Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to discuss data filtering, scaling, and processing in the context of environmental data and Earth Observation Systems (EOS), but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model.
