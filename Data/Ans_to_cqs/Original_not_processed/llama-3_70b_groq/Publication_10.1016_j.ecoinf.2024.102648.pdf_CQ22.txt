Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are R2, Root Average Squared Errors (RASE), and Average Absolute Error (AAE). These metrics are mentioned in Table 4, which compares the performance of different models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, Boosted Tree, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), for predicting CLCuD. 

R2 is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the data, with higher values indicating better performance. RASE and AAE are measures of the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance. 

It's worth noting that accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model. These metrics are commonly used in classification problems, but the context suggests that the problem is a regression problem, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (CLCuD percentage).
