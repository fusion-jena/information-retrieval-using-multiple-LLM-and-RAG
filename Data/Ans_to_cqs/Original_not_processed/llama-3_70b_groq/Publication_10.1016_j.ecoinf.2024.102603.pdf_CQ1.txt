Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various instruments and satellites used for collecting data related to atmospheric monitoring and vegetation index extraction. These include:

* TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (SENTINEL-5P TROPOMI)
* SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartog-raphY (ENVISAT SCIAMACHY)
* Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2)
* Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT)
* Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)

These instruments and satellites are likely used to collect raw data in the form of images and sensor readings, which can then be used as input for deep learning models. However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used for collecting raw data.

In summary, the answer to the query is that the context mentions the use of instruments and satellites for collecting raw data, but it does not provide information on the use of surveys or public datasets.
