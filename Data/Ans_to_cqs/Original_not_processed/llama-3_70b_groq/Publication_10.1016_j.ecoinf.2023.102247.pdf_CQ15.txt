Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses an ensemble modeling approach using BIOMOD2 package in R, which involves combining four different models (regression-based, MaxEnt, RF, and SVM) to generate a final ensembled model. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
