Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). It also describes the data sources and preprocessing steps, but it does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
