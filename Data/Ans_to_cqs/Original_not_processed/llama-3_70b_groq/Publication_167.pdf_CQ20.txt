Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the input data, batch normalization, and the structure of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) used in the deep learning module, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
