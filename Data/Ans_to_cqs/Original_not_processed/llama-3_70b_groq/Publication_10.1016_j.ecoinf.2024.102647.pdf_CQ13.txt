Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions that an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm was applied for soil salinity distribution mapping, but it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
