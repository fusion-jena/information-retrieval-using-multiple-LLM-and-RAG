Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model, nor does it discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to be related to data analysis, specifically the tracking of vocalizations of different song structures, and presents a table showing the number and proportion of tracks for each song variant. There is no mention of deep learning, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other measures related to machine learning model generalizability.
