Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context focuses on the evaluation metrics, model selection, and performance of different CNN architectures, including ResNet, VGG, and Inception. It also mentions the convergence of the models during training, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
