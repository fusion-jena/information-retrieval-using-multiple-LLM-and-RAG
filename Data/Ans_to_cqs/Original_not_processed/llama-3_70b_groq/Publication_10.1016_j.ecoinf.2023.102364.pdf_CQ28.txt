Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a geographic information system (GIS) platform, but it does not specify which cloud platform was used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
