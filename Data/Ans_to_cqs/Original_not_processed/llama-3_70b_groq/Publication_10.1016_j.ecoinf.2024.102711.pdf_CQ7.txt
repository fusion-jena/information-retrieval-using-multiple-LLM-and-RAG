Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss the process of dividing the development dataset into two categories: the training dataset and the tuning dataset, specifically for hyperparameter tuning.

In the context of k-fold cross-validation, the development dataset is evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group is used as the tuning dataset, and the remaining groups are used as the training dataset. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance of the k models represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters.

While this information is related to data splitting, it does not provide specific criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
