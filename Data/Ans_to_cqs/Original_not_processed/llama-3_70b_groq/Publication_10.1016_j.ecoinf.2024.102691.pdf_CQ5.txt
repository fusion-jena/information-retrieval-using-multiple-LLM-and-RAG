Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and training of a YOLOv5 model, particularly with a depth-attention mechanism, for object detection tasks. 

However, it does mention a "prior synthetic dataset" in the context of a fitting recognition approach combining depth-attention YOLOv5. This suggests that a synthetic dataset was used, but the specific name or details of the dataset are not provided.

Additionally, the context cites several research papers related to fruit detection and yield estimation, but these papers do not seem to be directly related to the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
