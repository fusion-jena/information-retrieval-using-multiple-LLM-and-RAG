Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the challenges of collecting sufficient training data, especially for remote sensing applications, and the use of a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which is pretrained on ImageNet. However, it does not specify how the raw data was collected.

It can be inferred that the context is related to remote sensing and land cover classification, but the data collection methods are not mentioned. It is possible that the data was collected through satellite imagery, LiDAR data, or other remote sensing technologies, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
