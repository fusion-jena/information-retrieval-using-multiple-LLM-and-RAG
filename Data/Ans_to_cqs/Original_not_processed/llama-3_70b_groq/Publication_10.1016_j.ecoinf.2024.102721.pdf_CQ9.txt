Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing a method for forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods. The article provides information about the authors, their affiliations, and some references, but it does not mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
