Answer::: 

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are specified in the context as follows: 

The authors used the fastai get_transforms function with the following arguments: 
- "flip_vert = TRUE" to allow for vertical flipping of images, 
- "max_lighting = 0.02" to limit overly exposing the images, 
- "max_zoom = 1" to disable the zooming augmentation, 
- "to_fp16 = TRUE" to reduce the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU).

Therefore, the data augmentation techniques applied are vertical flipping of images and limiting overly exposing the images. There is no mention of rotating or scaling in the provided context.
