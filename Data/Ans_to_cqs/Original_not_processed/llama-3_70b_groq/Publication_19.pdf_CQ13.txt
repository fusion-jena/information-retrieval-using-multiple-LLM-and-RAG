Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are as follows:

* Batch size:
	+ Inception-V3: 48
	+ MobileNet-V2: 32
	+ ResNet-18: 32
	+ DenseNet-121: 16
* Learning rate:
	+ Inception-V3: 0.05
	+ MobileNet-V2: 0.01
	+ ResNet-18: 0.005
	+ DenseNet-121: 0.001
* Number of epochs:
	+ Inception-V3: 75
	+ MobileNet-V2: 100
	+ ResNet-18: 150
	+ DenseNet-121: 100
* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

These hyperparameters were determined using a grid search.
