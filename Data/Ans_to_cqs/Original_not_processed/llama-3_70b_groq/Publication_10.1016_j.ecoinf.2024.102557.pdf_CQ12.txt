Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It mentions the application of deep learning in ecology, but it does not provide details about the type of model used. The context cites various studies that use machine learning and deep learning techniques for tasks such as species distribution, species identification, land use change characterization, and biodiversity conservation, but it does not specify the type of model used in these studies. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
