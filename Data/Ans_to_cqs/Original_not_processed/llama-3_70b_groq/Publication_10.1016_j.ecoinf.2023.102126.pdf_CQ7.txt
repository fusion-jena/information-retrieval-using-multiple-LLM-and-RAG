Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to evaluating datasets using F-UJI, a tool for assessing the FAIRness of research data, and discusses the methodology used to collect and analyze data from various repositories. It does not provide any information about deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
