Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the history and development of neural networks, deep learning, and their applications in various fields, including ecology and economics. It discusses the basics of neural networks, deep learning algorithms, and their applications, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
