Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and data processing techniques. It discusses the KDD sequence, which includes identifying the aim, pre-selecting useful data, analytical determinations, and optimizing results. However, it does not specify the methods used for collecting raw data.

The context does mention "data acquisition" as part of the KDD process, but it does not provide details on the methods used for collecting raw data. It also mentions "big spatiotemporal data" but does not explain how this data was collected.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
