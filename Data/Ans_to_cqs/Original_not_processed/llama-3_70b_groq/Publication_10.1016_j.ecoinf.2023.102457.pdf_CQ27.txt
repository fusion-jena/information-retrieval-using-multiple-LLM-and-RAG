Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the pre-trained BirdNET model, its architecture, and its application in extracting embeddings for gibbon vocalizations. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
