Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. According to the context, early stopping is the process that stops growing additional trees/layers/split when further addition of more trees/layers/split does not improve the validation statistic. This is done to prevent the model from overfitting the predicted percent CLCuD. Additionally, the penalty method was employed within the framework of ANN models to address the inclination of neural networks to overfit data.
