Answer:::
Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including Vision Transformers (ViT) and EfficientNetV2. Specifically, the MobileViT model, which is a type of Vision Transformer, is used for image classification. Additionally, the EfficientNetV2 model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is also used in the pipeline.
