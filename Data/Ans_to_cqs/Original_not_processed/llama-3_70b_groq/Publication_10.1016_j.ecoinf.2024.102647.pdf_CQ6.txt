Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance statistics of different models in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps and mentions feature selection as a step, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
