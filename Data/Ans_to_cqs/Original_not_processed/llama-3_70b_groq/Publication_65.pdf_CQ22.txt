Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does mention that DeepLabV3+ was the best classifier method from a quantitative perspective, returning the best available results for the chosen metrics. It also mentions that all five state-of-the-art networks are capable of segmenting trees inside a Cerrado urban environment in a satisfactory way with the proposed imagery dataset.

Table 2 provides some information about the performance of the models, including the number of parameters, training time, inference time, and other metrics. However, it does not specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.
