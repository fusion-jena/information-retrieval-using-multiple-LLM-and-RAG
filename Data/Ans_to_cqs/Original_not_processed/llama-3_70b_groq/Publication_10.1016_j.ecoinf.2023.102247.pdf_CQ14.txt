Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the ensemble modeling approach used, the different models employed (including regression-based, Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines), and the cross-validation method used to test model performance. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
