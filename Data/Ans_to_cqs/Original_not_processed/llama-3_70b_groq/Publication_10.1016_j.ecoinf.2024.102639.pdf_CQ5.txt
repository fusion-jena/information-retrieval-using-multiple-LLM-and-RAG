Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to animal behavior studies, machine learning, and deep learning, but it does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The figures mentioned (Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14) seem to be related to confusion matrices for zebrafish and rat behavior, but they do not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
