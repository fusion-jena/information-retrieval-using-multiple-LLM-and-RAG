Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on image processing, annotation, and analysis in various domains like karyotyping, neuron tracing, and fungal image analysis.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Fixing the random seed: This ensures reproducibility of results by setting the random seed to a fixed value, allowing for identical initialization of model weights and biases.
2. Data shuffling: Shuffling the training data can help reduce overfitting and improve model generalization by randomizing the order of samples.
3. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the input data for each mini-batch, reducing the impact of random fluctuations.
4. Ensemble methods: Combining the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations can improve model robustness and reduce the effect of randomness.
5. Hyperparameter tuning: Systematically searching for optimal hyperparameters can help identify the best model configuration, reducing the impact of random initialization.

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are common practices in deep learning pipelines.
