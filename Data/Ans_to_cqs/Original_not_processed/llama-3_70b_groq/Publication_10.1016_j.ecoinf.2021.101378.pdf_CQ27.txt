Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning methods in ecological informatics, specifically in the context of species distribution modeling and pest/disease management. It cites various studies and references related to these topics, but does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
