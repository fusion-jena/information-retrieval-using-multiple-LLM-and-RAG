Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that "the kernel could be chosen randomly" in the context of convolution operations. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the selection of kernels, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is handled or controlled.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as fixing the random seed value, using reproducible random number generators, and averaging results over multiple runs to handle randomness. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
