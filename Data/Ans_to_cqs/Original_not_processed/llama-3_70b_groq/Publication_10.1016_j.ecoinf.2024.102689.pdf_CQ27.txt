Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers, precision aquaculture, pruning techniques for simplifying deep neural networks, and model compression via distillation and quantization. It also provides details about the experimental setup, including the programming language, GPU, and optimization techniques used. However, it does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
