Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning for tree crown detection, and it provides references to other research papers and journals, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
