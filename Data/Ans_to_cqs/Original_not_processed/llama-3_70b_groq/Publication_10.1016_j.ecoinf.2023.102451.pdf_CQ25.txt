Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the EMViT-Net, is for the classification of environmental microorganisms. This is stated in the context as "the proposed model is tested on a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganism EMDS-6 combining 21 categories of microorganisms using microscopic images" and "the end-to-end classification of EMs". This implies that the model is designed to classify different types of environmental microorganisms based on their microscopic images.
