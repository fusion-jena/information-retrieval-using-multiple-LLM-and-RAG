Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of an early stopping procedure. This procedure is used to avoid over-fitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving. The patience parameter, which controls the number of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, was set to 10. This means that if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped.
