Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on hiking trails and outdoor activities, using data from the Wikiloc platform. It discusses data collection, pre-filtering, and processing, but does not mention machine learning or training models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
