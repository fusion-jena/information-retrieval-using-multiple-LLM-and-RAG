Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the dataset was "randomly divided into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set" in a stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all parts. This suggests that some form of randomization was used in the data splitting process, but the specific strategy or technique used to handle randomness is not mentioned.

It is common in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, but this is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy employed to handle randomness in this particular deep learning pipeline.
