Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases, and the Apriori algorithm, which is a machine learning algorithm used for frequent itemset mining. The context does mention pruning as a data compression technique used in the Apriori algorithm to reduce the complexity of decision trees and improve predictive accuracy, but it does not discuss regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
