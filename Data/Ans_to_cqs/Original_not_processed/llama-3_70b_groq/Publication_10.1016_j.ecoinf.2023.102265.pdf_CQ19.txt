Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the use of ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for feature extraction. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement or train the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
