Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The text appears to be focused on analyzing complex networks in the urban acoustic environment, using techniques such as stochastic block models and Python packages. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
