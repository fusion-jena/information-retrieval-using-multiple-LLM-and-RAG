Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to perform matrix factorization, specifically to reconstruct non-observed representations in a matrix. The model is designed to capture spatial-temporal characteristics of data and improve the quality of imputations. It combines the interpretation and mathematical meaning of matrix factorization with the learning capabilities of deep neural networks. The model is used to learn the low-dimensional space for the representations of sensors and time, and to estimate missing data.
