Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables, and references several studies and papers, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
