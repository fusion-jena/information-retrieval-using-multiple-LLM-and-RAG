Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. The model is trained to identify different land use and land cover (LULC) classes and generate a spatial map of LULC, where each pixel is assigned to a specific class. The output layer of the neural network generates LULC classification predictions, and an activation function like Softmax is used to obtain probability estimates for each LULC class.
