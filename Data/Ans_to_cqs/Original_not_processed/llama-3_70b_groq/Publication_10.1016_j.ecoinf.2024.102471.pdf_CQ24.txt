Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for bird species classification based on their calls, and discusses the architecture and training process of the models. It does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
