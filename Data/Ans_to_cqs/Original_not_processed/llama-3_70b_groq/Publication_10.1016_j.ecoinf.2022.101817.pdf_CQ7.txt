Answer: 

According to the provided context, the data was split into a training and testing set with a ratio of 80/20. This means that 80% of the data (9600 frames) was used for training the deep learning model, and 20% of the data (2400 frames) was used for testing. There is no explicit mention of a separate validation set, but it is mentioned that the validation performance of CNN Model 4 is shown in the confusion matrix of Fig. 7 (b). This suggests that a validation set might have been used, but the exact criteria for splitting the data into a validation set are not specified.
