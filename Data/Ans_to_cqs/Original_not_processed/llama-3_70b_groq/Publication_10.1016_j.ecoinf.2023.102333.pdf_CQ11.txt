Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, deep learning, and land use/land cover classification, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
