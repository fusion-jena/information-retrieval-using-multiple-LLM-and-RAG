Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the comparison of training time, prediction time, and optimization time for CNN and XGB models, as well as the input variables used in these models. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
