Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This is evident from the figures (Fig. 11 and Fig. 13) which display instance maps with unique colors corresponding to each object's bounding box.
2. Instance segmentation: The mask map in the figures (Fig. 11 and Fig. 13) reveals segmentation masks for each object, highlighting the regions within the bounding boxes.
3. Label annotation: The label map in the figures (Fig. 11 and Fig. 13) categorizes objects with distinct colors that match their bounding boxes.

Additionally, the context mentions "ground-truth annotations" which suggests that the dataset is annotated with correct labels and boundaries for objects. However, it does not provide information on other annotation techniques such as keypoint annotation, semantic segmentation, or tracking annotation.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of annotation techniques used in the pipeline, and it is possible that other techniques are used as well.
