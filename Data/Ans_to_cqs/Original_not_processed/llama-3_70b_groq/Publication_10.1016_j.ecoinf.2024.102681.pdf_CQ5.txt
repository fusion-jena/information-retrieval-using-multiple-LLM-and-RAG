Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on drought propagation and prediction, with references to various studies and a description of a CNN-LSTM hybrid model. The dataset used in this study is a comprehensive dataset compiled by the authors, which encompasses various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. However, it does not mention any of the commonly used datasets in deep learning pipelines.
