Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning approaches and models used for fish detection, biomass estimation, and passage monitoring, but it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques employed.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that some form of object detection or instance segmentation might be involved, as the papers mention the use of YOLOv5s, CMFTNet, and other object detection networks. These networks typically require annotated data, such as bounding boxes or instance masks, to train and evaluate their performance.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific annotation techniques used in the pipeline. If more context or information about the datasets and annotation processes were provided, a more detailed answer could be given.
