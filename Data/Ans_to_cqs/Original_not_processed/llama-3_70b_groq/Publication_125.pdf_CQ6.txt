Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a CNN model, transfer learning, and the runtime of different CNN models. It also discusses the importance of privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) techniques for satellite image classification.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "Data Augmentation" in Section 4.2.1, which is a common preprocessing technique used in deep learning. Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping. This helps to improve the model's robustness and ability to generalize to new data.

Apart from data augmentation, other common preprocessing steps that are typically involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, it does mention data augmentation as a relevant technique.
