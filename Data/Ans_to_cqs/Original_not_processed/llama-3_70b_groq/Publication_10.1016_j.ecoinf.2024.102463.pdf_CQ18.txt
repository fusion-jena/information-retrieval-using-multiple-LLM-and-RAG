Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance metrics used to evaluate the model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score. These metrics are used to determine the best-performing configurations during the Hyperband algorithm's successive halving process. The model's performance is likely monitored and evaluated based on these metrics during the training phase.
