Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training, but it does not provide specific information on how to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
