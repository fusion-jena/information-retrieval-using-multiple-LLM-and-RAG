Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in species distribution modeling and predicting species assemblages. It discusses the use of cross-entropy loss function, softmax probabilities, and thresholding to obtain the predicted species assemblage. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
