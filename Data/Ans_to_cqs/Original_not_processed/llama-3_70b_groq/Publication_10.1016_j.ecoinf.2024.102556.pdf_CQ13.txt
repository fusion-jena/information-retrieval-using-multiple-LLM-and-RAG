Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the shortcomings of traditional feature extraction methods, the introduction of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet), and the use of YOLOv7 as a baseline model for object tracking and identification. It also explains the structure and components of the YOLOv7 model, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
