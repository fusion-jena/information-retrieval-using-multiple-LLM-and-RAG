Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that the Lang10m was derived fusing the GEDI and Sentinel-2 images through a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022), but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
