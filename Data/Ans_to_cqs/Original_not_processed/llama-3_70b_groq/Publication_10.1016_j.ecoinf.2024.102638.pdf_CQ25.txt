Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses various machine learning models such as KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP, and their hyperparameters, but it does not specify the task or problem they are trying to solve. It mentions that the dataset is divided into training and test sets, and that the models are fine-tuned using GridSearchCV with a five-fold cross-validation, but it does not provide information about the specific task or application of the models. Therefore, I don't know the purpose of the deep learning model in this context.
