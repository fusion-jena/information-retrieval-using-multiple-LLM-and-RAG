Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models are to be deployed on IoT edge devices, specifically Raspberry Pi, and that TensorFlow Lite is used. This suggests that the models may have been converted to a format compatible with TensorFlow Lite for deployment on the edge devices. 

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
