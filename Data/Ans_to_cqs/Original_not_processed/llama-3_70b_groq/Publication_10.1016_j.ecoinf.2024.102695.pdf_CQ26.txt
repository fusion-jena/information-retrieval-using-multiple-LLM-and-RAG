Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is chronological splitting of the dataset. The dataset is divided into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy is mentioned to better simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the model. 

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias. The context only mentions the chronological splitting of the dataset to prevent data snooping bias.
