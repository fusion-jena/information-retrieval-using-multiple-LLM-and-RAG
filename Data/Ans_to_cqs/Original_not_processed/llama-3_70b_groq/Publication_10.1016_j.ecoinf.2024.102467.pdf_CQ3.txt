Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and articles in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and aquaculture, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
