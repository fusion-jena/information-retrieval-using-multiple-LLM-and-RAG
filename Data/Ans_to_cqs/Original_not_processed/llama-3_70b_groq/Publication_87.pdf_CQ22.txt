Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, and precision. Specifically, accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions, recall is a measure of false negatives (FN) with recall = TP / (TP + FN) where TP is for true positives, and precision is a measure of false positives (FP) with precision = TP / (TP + FP).
