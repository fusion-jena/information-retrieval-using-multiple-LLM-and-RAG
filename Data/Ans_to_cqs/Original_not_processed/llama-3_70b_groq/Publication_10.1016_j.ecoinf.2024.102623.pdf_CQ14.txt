Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. The context only discusses the performance of different models and loss functions, and the effect of varying hyperparameters (such as Î»2) on the model's performance. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
