Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only mentions data augmentation and flattening convolution kernels as part of the data preparation process. It also mentions preparing data by extracting training samples from ground truth images, but it does not provide details on any specific preprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
