Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The dataset consists of 426,876 images, which are centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle and augmented in various ways, such as flipping, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mention of multispectral imaging flow cytometry also suggest that the data format is image-based.
