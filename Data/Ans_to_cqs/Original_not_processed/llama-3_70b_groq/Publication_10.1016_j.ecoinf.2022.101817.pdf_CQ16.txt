Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different CNN models for environmental condition classification, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and confusion matrices. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance metrics, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
