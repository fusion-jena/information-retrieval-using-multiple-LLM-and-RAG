Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the Res_AUNet network, its architecture, and its performance on the WSGD dataset, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
