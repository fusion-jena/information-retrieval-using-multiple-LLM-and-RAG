Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the comparison of the full model with self-supervised and hand-annotated data, and the improvement of the model with better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

It can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated on a withheld dataset (Figure 7), but the context does not provide details on the metrics used to monitor the performance or the frequency of evaluation during training. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
