Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only explains the architecture of the convolutional neural network and its components, such as the input layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. It does not provide information about the implementation details, including the framework used to build the model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to build the model.
