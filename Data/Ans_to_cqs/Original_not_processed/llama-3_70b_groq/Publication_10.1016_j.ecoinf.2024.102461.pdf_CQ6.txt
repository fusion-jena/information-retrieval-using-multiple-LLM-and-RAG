Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of remote sensing data, machine learning techniques, and GIS to create fire risk maps in forest ecosystems. It discusses the importance of high spatial resolution data, various modeling techniques, and the Jenks' natural break classification method. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
