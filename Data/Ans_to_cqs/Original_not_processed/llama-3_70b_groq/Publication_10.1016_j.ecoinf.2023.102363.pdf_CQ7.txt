Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does provide some information about the experimental design and model fine-tuning.

In the experimental design section (2.1.1), it is mentioned that the models are validated during training by combining the original base model validation set (Table 1) with 100 frames per class from the labelled December 3rd 2019 training set, randomly pooled per experiment. This suggests that the data is split into a training set and a validation set, but the exact criteria for this split are not specified.

Additionally, there is no mention of a test set in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear how the data is split for model evaluation.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
