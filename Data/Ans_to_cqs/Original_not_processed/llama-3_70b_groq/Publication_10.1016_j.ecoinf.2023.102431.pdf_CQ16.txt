Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on discriminant analysis of species and sex using track measurements, and it discusses the development and evaluation of models for sex identification. It provides information on sample sizes, misclassification rates, and model performance, but it does not address the specific question of when training is complete.
