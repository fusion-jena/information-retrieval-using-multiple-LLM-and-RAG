Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image and LiDAR data. The papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of remote sensing data, such as Landsat, Sentinel-1, and GEDI, which are typically in raster image formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of airborne LiDAR data, which is typically in point cloud format.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV files are mentioned in one of the papers, but it is not clear if they are used as input data for the deep learning models.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline, and it's possible that other data formats may be used in addition to image and LiDAR data. However, based on the information provided, it appears that image and LiDAR data are the primary formats used in the pipeline.
