Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning models and techniques used for estimating forest biomass, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
