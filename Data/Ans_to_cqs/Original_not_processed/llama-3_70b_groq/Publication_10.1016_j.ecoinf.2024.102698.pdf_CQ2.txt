Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic connectivity data, but it does not specify the format of the input or output data. 

However, based on the mention of spatial distributions and site areas in Figure 3, it can be inferred that the data might be related to geographic or spatial data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders, which are commonly used for image and spatial data processing. 

But, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
