The context appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research article, and it discusses the use of deep learning for image classification in the context of hydrothermal vents. It mentions various references and citations, but it does not provide information about a data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the answer to this query based on the provided context.
