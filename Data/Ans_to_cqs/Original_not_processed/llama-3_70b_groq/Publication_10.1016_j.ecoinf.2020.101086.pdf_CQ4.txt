Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and methods for correcting sampling bias in presence-background datasets, but it does not mention deep learning or image processing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
