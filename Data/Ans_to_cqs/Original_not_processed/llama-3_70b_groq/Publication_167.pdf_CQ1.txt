Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the processing and analysis of existing data, including the use of batch normalization and Markov models, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It is possible that the data was collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods, but this information is not specified in the context.
