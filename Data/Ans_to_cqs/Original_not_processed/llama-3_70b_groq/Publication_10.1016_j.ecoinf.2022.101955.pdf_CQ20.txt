Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, and provides details on the architecture and parameters of the MLP ANN model used. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
