Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "the transformations must be made on the audios, and later these transformations will be reflected in the mel-spectrogram images." This implies that the data augmentation techniques used are related to audio transformations, but the specific techniques are not specified.

It is mentioned that for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios were generated, but the exact techniques used to generate these additional audios are not described. The context does not mention common image-based data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, as these are not applicable to audio data.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques used in this pipeline, as they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
