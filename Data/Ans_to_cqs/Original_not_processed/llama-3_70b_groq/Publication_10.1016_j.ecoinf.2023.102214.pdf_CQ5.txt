Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on a snow leopard dataset, specifically the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research, which is contributed to Whiskerbook.org. It also mentions a Min-3/Max-10 data subset, which is frequently used for training machine learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information about other general-purpose datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
