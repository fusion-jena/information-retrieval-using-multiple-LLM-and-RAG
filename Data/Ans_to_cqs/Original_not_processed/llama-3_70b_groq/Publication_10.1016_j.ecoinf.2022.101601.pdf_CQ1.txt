Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on permafrost-related data. However, the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

From the context, it can be inferred that the data is related to environmental factors such as soil temperature, soil water content, solar radiation, thermal conductivity, vegetation height, and snow depth. It is likely that sensors and field measurements are used to collect this type of data. Additionally, public datasets or existing research studies may also be utilized.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Surveys are unlikely to be a primary method for collecting this type of data, as it is more focused on environmental and physical parameters rather than human opinions or perceptions.

In summary, while the context provides some insight into the type of data being used, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data. It is likely that sensors, field measurements, and public datasets are used, but more information is needed to confirm this.
