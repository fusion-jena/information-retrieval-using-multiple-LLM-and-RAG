Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study are the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS). These metrics are used to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual images.
