Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various applications of deep learning in ecology, feature extraction, and graph neural networks, but it does not provide information about optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
