Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of historical aerial images for ecological analysis, and it mentions the use of QGIS and R for image processing and analysis. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
