Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The text mentions various components that are commonly used in CNNs, such as convolutional kernels, batch normalization, and max pooling layers. Additionally, the context mentions specific modules like Res2Net, MSNet, and RepConv, which are all related to convolutional neural networks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, which suggests that the model is primarily a CNN-based architecture.
