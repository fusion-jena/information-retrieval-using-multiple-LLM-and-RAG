Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the use of deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks, to create high-resolution CHM of the Earth and to fuse GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images. It does not provide information about the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
