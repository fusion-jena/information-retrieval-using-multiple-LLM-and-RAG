Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of extracting 97 images from April 2013 to July 2021 using the Code Editor tool, and analyzing 9841 areas in the forest using NDVI data extracted from these images. Additionally, the context mentions using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to retrieve, map, and analyze images to extract information about spectral indices. However, it is not explicitly stated what data format these images are in (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.). 

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV data is not explicitly mentioned either, but it is possible that the mean NDVI scores, month date stamps, and forest vulnerability data are stored in a CSV file or a similar tabular format. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
