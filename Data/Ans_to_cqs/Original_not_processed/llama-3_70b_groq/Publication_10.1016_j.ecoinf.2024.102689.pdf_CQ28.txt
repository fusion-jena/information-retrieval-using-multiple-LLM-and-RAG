Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Anaconda3, Pytorch, and CUDA, which are related to the development and training of the model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
