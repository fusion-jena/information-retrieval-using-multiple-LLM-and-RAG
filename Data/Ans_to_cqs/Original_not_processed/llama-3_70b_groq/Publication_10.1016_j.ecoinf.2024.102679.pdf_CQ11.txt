Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references cited in the article are mostly academic papers and do not provide a direct link to a data repository. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in wildlife conservation and aerial surveys, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
