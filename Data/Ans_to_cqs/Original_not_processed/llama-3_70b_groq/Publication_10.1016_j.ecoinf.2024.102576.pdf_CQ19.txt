Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the type of model used, which is the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). It does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
