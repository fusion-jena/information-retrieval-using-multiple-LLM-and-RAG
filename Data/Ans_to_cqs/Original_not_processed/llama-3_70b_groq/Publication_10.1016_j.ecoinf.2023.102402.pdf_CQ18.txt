Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the model's accuracy and performance, but they do not provide information on the strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training.

It can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated after training, as the AUC and TSS values are calculated and used to classify the model's performance into poor, medium, and good categories. However, the context does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training based on the provided context.
