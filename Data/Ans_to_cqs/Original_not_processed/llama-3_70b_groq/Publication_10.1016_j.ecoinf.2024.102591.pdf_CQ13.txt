Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be related to wildfire events, vegetation recovery, and remote sensing models (PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL), but it does not provide information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
