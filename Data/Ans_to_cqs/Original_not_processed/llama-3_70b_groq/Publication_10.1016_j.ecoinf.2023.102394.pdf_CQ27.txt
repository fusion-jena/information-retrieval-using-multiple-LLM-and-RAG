Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning models for soil organic carbon prediction, references various studies and techniques, and lists the parameter settings of the MLP model in Table 2. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
