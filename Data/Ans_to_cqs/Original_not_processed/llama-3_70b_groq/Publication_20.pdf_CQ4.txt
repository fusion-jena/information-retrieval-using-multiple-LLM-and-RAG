Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the architecture and training parameters of the GoogLeNet model, including the use of a learning rate, exponential learning decay, dropout, and weight initialization. It also mentions the use of a large dataset of 900,000 images, but does not provide details on any data augmentation techniques used to prepare the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
