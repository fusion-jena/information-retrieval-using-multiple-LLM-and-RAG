Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training of the deep learning model, its application in land-cover classification, and the preparation of input data for model training. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
