Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the authorship contribution statement, data availability, acknowledgments, and references. It also discusses the methodology and evaluation of animal tracking using a Siamese network and few-shot learning. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
