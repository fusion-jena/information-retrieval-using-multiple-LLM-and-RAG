Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and wetland biodiversity maintenance, with equations and parameters describing ecological health and condition. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning concepts, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.
