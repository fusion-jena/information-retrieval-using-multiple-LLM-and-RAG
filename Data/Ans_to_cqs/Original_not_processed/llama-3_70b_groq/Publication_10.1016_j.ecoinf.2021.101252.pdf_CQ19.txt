Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only discusses the use of AutoML, ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN architectures, but does not provide information about the underlying frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
