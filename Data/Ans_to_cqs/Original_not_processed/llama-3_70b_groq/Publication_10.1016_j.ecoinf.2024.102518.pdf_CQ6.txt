Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological niche models, and it discusses the use of metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI, as well as the selection of optimal model parameters. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
