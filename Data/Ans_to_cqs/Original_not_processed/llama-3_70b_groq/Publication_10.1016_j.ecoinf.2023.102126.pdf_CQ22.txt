Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to be discussing the FAIR assessment of datasets using the F-UJI tool, which evaluates the datasets based on 16 metrics distributed among four principles. These metrics are not related to the performance evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
