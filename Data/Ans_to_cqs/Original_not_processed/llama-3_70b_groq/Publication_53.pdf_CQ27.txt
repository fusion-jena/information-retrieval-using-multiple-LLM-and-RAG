Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and validation of the model, as well as the statistical analyses and results. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
