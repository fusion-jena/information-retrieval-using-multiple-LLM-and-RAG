Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context provides information about the model architecture, training process, and references to various research papers, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
