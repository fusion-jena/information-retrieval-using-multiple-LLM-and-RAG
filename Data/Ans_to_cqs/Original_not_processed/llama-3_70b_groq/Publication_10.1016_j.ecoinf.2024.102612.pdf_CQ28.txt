Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the training and testing of the model, as well as its application to segment point cloud data, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
