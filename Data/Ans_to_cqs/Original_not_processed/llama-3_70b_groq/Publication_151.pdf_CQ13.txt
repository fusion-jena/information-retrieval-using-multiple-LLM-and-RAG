Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the embedding size k is set to 128 for data sets with 200 taxon and 512 for larger data sets, and that other hyperparameters are fixed to their defaults (Table S2 of the Supplementary material available on Dryad) unless otherwise specified. It also mentions that the batch size is fixed to 32 and the training loss is checked every 50 epochs, with the training stopping when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. However, it does not provide information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the model.
