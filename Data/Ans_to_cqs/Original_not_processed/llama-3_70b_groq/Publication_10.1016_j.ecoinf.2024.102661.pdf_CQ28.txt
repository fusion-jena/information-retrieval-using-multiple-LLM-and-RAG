Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the research, including the development of a deep learning approach for forecasting agricultural carbon emissions in China. It discusses the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and the Tree-structured Parzen estimator Bayesian optimization (TPEBO) method, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
