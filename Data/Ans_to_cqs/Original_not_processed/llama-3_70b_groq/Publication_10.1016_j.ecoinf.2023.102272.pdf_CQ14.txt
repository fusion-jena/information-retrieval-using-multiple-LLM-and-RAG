Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides the values of the hyperparameters used for each classical machine learning model (xgbTree, RF, NNET, and DNN) for each test year. It does not mention whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
