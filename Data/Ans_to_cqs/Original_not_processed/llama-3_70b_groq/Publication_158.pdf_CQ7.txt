Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on a systematic approach using a grid of sample blocks. The data is divided into training, validation, and test sets. 

Specifically, the data is split as follows: a column of the sample grid is randomly selected, and every fourth column from that is added. Only every second row for the selected columns is included in the test sample. This results in 39,520 (60%) training samples, 23,934 (30%) verification samples, and 6509 (10%) test samples.
