Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecology and conservation biology, with references to papers on topics like machine learning, species distribution models, and fungal productivity. While some papers mention machine learning and deep learning, they do not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
