Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing machine learning algorithms, specifically k-nearest neighbors and decision trees, and their application to a dataset for classification. It also touches on topics like variable importance and data visualization, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
