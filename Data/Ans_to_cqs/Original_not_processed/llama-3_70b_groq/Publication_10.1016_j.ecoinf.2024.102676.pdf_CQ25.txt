Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The context mentions that the model is used to classify three sympatric otter species, and it is also mentioned that the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method is used for classification. Additionally, the paper cites a study by Garcia-Laencina et al. (2010) on pattern classification with missing data, which further supports the idea that the deep learning model is used for classification.
