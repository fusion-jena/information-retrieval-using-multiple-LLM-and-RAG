Answer:::
Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are chronological allocation, where the dataset is divided into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy is used to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the model.
