Answer: 

According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: precision, recall, and F-score. 

Precision is the proportion of recognizer hits that are true detections of the target species, calculated as precision = tp/(tp + fp), where tp is the number of true positives and fp is the number of false positives. 

Recall is the proportion of target species vocalizations detected as hits by a recognizer, calculated as recall = tp/(tp + fn), where fn is the number of false negatives. 

The F-score is a combination of precision and recall, calculated as F-score = ((B^2 + 1) * precision * recall)/(B^2 * precision + recall), where β is a user-defined metric that allows prioritization of one of the two. In this case, β = 1, which means precision and recall are evenly balanced in importance. 

There is no mention of accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context.
