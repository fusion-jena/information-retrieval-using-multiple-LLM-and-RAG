Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context discusses machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and K-nearest neighbors, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
