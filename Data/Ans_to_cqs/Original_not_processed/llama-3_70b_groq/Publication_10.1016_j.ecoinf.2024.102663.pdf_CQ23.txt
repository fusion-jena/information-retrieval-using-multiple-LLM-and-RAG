Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, preprocessing methods, and results of the YOLOv8 model. It does not provide information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques used to ensure generalizability.

However, we can infer that the dataset used is diverse, as it consists of images of fish with varying biomass ranges (10-126 g) and image resolutions (1920p*1080p). The dataset size is also relatively large, with 915 images. This diversity in the dataset might contribute to the model's generalizability. Nevertheless, without explicit information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques, we cannot confirm the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
