Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using three criteria: accuracy, recall, and F1-Score, which are calculated using the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is used to measure the model's performance by dividing the sample into four situations based on the actual classification and the predicted classification. 

The accuracy, recall, and F1-Score are calculated using the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values obtained from the confusion matrix. The formulas for calculating these metrics are provided in the context. 

Although the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using these metrics, and the Elastic Net is used to improve the model's performance by solving the overfitting problem and improving the generalization ability of the ESK model.
