Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the division of training samples, parameter tuning using grid search, and feature variable selection. It also discusses the results and analysis of the model, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
