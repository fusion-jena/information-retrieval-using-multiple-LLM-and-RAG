Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated to evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that MSE is used as a performance metric, but it does not provide information on other metrics that might be used.
