Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of deep learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and their integration with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform through the Google Cloud platform. It does not provide information about the specific frameworks used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
