Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, and its application in regression tasks. 

However, it does mention the importance of randomness in the construction of random forests. Randomness is introduced by selecting a random subset of features at each candidate split during the learning process and by training each decision tree on a random subset of the data in the training set. This randomness helps to increase the diversity of the decision trees and decrease their correlation, which can improve the overall performance of the random forest model.

In the context of deep learning, strategies for handling randomness might include setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, using techniques such as dropout to introduce randomness during training, or employing ensemble methods that combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations. However, these strategies are not discussed in the provided context.
