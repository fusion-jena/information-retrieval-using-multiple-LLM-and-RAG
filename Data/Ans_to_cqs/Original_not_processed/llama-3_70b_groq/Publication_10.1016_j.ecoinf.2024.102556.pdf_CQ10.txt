Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing various techniques and methods for feature extraction and target detection, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. The references cited are academic papers and do not include links to code repositories. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
