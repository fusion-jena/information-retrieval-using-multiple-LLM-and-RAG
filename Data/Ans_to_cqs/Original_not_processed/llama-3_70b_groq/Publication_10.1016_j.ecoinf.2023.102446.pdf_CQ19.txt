Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text appears to be discussing a method for generating process networks using information theory-based transfer entropy approach, and it provides references to various studies and papers in the field of ecology and environmental science. There is no mention of deep learning or any related frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
