Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be discussing data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and data processing techniques, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
