Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the design and optimization of deep learning models, particularly the AlexNet and SIAlex models, to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy. It discusses techniques such as convolutional layers, residual connections, and structural re-parameterization to improve model performance and efficiency.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, such as bird image classification, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps performed on the input data before training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
