Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation (CV). According to the context, k is 10 in the experiments, which means the dataset is divided into 10 folds, and the model is trained and evaluated 10 times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
