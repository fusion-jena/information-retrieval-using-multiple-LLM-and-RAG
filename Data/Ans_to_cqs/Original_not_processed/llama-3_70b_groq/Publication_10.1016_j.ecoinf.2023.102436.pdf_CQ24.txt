Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or random seed values. The context appears to be related to landscape design, urban planning, and environmental performance evaluation, with a focus on the use of convolutional neural networks for image-based methods and 3D modeling. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
