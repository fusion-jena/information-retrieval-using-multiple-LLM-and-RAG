Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its training, nor does it discuss a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to wildland fires, firefighter safety, and the development of a system (IFDS) that may be used for decision support. It mentions feedback from experts on the system's performance, usability, and reliability, but this is not related to model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
