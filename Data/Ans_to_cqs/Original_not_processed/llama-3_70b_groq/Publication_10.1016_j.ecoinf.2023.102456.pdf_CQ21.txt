Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation and confusion matrix are part of the postprocessing steps.

The text mentions that the authors will "present the evaluation results through the use of figures and numerical data" and that "the use of confusion matrices will provide us with detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by our model." This suggests that the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix are part of the postprocessing steps.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps. Therefore, it cannot be determined if saliency maps are part of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
