Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on data filtering, scaling, and workflow replicability in the context of environmental time series data and Earth Observation (EO) data. It discusses the importance of data scaling for gap-filling operations and aggregating data across scales prior to modeling, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
