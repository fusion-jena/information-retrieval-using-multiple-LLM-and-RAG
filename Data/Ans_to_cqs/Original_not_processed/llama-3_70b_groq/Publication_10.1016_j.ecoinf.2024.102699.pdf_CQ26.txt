Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques used to improve the performance of deep learning models for bird audio detection. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors have used data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data, which can help mitigate data bias to some extent. The techniques used include adding noise, time and frequency masking, pitch shifting, and other methods to create new samples from the existing data. 

While these techniques can help reduce data bias, they are not explicitly mentioned as methods to address data bias. The context does not mention other common techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were used in this specific study.
