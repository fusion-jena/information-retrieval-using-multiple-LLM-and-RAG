Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models and the performance of the MG and MO models on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. It also mentions the model's hyperparameters, such as batch size, momentum, and dropout ratio, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
