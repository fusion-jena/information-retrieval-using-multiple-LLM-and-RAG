Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic data, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, which is a type of deep learning model that can be used for dimensionality reduction and generative modeling. VAEs can be regularized using techniques such as KL divergence regularization, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which regularization methods are used in the specific deep learning pipeline referred to in the query.
