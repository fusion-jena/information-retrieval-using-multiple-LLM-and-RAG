Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on wetlands in East Africa, using Sentinel-2 satellite data and spatial datasets from 2010 and 2017. It discusses the selection of wetlands based on their management categories and boundaries, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
