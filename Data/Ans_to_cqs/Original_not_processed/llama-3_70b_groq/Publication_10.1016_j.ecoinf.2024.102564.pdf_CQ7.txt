Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the configuration of Random Forest (RF) training, including the number of random regression trees, the number of division variables, and the minimum size of nodes. It also provides a comparison of the performance of different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on a dataset related to net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
