Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be an academic paper discussing the use of extreme learning machines and deep learning in biosecurity, specifically for marine species identification, but it does not include any information about the availability of the code.
