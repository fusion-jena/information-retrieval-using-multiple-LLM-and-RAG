Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using machine learning techniques, specifically mentioning Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
