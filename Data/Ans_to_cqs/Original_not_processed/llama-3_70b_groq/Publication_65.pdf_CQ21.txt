Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architecture, and computational complexity of different CNN models. It discusses the evaluation process, data augmentation techniques, and visual analysis of feature maps, but it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
