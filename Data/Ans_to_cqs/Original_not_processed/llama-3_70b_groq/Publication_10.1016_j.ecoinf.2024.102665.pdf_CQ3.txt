Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to coral reefs, fish, and benthic communities, with references to various research papers and a glossary of terms. However, it does not provide information about data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
