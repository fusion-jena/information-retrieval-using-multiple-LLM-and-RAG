Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model was trained for 10 epochs, and if the model was found to perform badly, additional pictures were manually labelled and added to the training dataset. This process was repeated until a satisfactory performance was achieved.

It can be inferred that the criteria used to determine when training is complete might be based on the model's performance, but the specific metric or threshold used to determine this is not mentioned. It is possible that the authors used a validation loss plateau or a certain level of accuracy as a stopping criterion, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
