Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. This method is mentioned in the context as having a certain randomness, which results in a slight difference in training time. However, the context does not provide further details on how this randomness is handled or what specific strategies are employed to mitigate its effects.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of random seed values, which is a common strategy used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. Random seed values can be used to ensure reproducibility of results by fixing the random initialization of model parameters and the order of data processing.

In general, other strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include using techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and ensemble methods. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, the strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, but the context does not provide further details on how this randomness is handled or what specific strategies are employed to mitigate its effects.
