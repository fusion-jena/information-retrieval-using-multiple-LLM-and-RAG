Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions that "We fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including the Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, and residual network (ResNet) CNNs, using the training dataset..." This indicates that the authors used different variants of CNNs, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet, to classify landscape types.
