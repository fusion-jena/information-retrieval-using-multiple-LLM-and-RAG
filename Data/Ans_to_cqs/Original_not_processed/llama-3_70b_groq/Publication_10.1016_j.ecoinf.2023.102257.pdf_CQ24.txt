Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be discussing the use of machine learning (ML) bounding boxes to accelerate the data labeling process for wildlife monitoring using camera traps. It discusses the experiment's objectives, materials, and methods, as well as the results, which show that ML bounding boxes can improve tagging efficiency. However, it does not provide any information about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
