Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention some post-classification steps.

According to the context, the post-classification steps involve morphological operations, specifically "opening" and "closing" operations. The "opening" operation removes small misclassified pixels or speckles by performing an erosion followed by dilation using a structural element. The "closing" operation closes the gaps and holes in the classified map by performing a dilation followed by an erosion using a structural element. These operations are performed iteratively to increase spatial coherency.

No other post-processing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, are mentioned in the provided context.
