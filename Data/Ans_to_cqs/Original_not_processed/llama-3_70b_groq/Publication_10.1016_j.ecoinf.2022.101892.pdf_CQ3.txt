Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on model architectures, training procedures, and experimental settings for image classification tasks. 

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the experiments, such as the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets, might have undergone some form of annotation or preprocessing, as the models are trained on these datasets. But the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
