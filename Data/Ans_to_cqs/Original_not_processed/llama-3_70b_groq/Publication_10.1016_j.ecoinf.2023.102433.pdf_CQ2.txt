Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, it does mention that the data can be chosen between text/csv (i.e., comma-separated values) or application/json format, following the common MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types guidelines. This suggests that CSV and JSON formats are used in the context of remote sensing data processing, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
