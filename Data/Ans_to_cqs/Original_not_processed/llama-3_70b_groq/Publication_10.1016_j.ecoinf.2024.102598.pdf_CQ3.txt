Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on forest fires, discussing ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
