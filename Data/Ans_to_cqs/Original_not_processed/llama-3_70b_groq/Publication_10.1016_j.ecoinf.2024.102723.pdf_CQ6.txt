Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and implementation details of the MCD and VBI neural networks, including the number of nodes, activation functions, dropout rates, and optimizers used. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps applied to the input data before feeding it into the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
