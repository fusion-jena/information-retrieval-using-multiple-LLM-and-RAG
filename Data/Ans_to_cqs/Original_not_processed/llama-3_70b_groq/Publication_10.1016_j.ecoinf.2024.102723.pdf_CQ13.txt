Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context focuses on the architecture of the Bayesian Neural Networks, the advantages of using probability theory to express uncertainty, and the comparison of the MCD and VBI approaches. It provides details on the neural networks settings, including the number of nodes in each layer and the use of Monte Carlo Dropout and DenseVariational layers. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
