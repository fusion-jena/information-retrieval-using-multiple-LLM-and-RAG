Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development of a GUI for hummingbird video analysis using a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for specific classes.

However, it can be inferred that some form of feature extraction is involved, as the context mentions extracting feature vectors for the frozen layers in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a fixed inception layer, which might imply some form of preprocessing or feature extraction.

But, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
