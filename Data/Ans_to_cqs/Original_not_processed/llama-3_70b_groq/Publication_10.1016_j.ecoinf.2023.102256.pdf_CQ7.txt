Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

* 70% of the downloaded recordings were randomly selected for the training dataset.
* The remaining 30% were kept for testing.
* Data augmentation was applied only to the training dataset.
* The segments obtained were randomly distributed between the training and validation sets with a ratio of 0.8/0.2.

In other words, the data was split into three sets: training (70%), testing (30%), and validation (20% of the training data). This split is a common practice in deep learning model training to ensure that the model is trained on a large dataset, validated on a smaller dataset to prevent overfitting, and tested on an unseen dataset to evaluate its performance.
