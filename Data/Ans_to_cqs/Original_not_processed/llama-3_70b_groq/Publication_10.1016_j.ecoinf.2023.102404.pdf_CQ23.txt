Answer: 

The context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a machine learning model using decision trees. To ensure the generalizability of this model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, a grid search method was employed to optimize the model's hyperparameters, which helps to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. 

Secondly, cross-validation techniques were used to evaluate the model's performance during the grid search process. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data.

Lastly, a stratified random sampling approach was used to split the data into training and testing sets. This approach ensures that the training and testing datasets accurately represent the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps, which is crucial for the model's generalizability.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset being used, but the stratified random sampling approach helps to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.
