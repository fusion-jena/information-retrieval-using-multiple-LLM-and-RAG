Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context are as follows: the first 4 years (2018-2021) were used as the training set, while the last year (2022) was used as the test set. This split is approximately 80-20%, which is a common rule in machine learning. Additionally, k-fold cross-validation was performed, where the training set was split into k fractions, each one being used iteratively as a validation set, while the remaining k-1 fractions were used as the training set. In this case, k was chosen to be 4, so that each validation fraction corresponds approximately to one year.
