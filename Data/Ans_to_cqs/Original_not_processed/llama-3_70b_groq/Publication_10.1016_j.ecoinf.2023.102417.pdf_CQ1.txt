Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through images captured by camera devices. The text mentions "different camera devices" and "different camera sensors" which suggests that camera devices are used to collect the raw data. Additionally, it is mentioned that "multispectral or hyperspectral images can be used to reduce the annotation effort" which implies that the images are captured using cameras with multispectral or hyperspectral capabilities. 

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. However, it is mentioned that the data acquisition methods and/or devices can change over time, which suggests that the raw data collection method might not be limited to a specific type of camera device or sensor.
