Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. The text mentions "classification accuracy" and provides specific accuracy values for the species, genus, and subfamily models, such as 99.47%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Additionally, it mentions "validation accuracy" and provides values such as 98.78%, 99.86%, and 99.73%. However, it does not mention other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
