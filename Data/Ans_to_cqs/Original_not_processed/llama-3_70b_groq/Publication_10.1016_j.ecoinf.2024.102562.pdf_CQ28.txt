Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the research, including the use of Mask-RCNN for image analysis and the application of microfluidics in soil chips. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
