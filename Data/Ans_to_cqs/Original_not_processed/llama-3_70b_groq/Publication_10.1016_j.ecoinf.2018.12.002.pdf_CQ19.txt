Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to machine learning and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models. The references cited in the context are related to machine learning, Bayesian inference, and movement ecology, but they do not mention deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
