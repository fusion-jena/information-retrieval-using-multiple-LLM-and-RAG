Answer::: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on the year of the data. The data of a certain year are used as the test set, and the remaining data are split into the training and validation sets using the 10-fold cross-validation method. In this method, the data are divided into ten parts, where nine parts are used as the training set and one part is used for the validation set. The percentage of the training, validation, and testing sets is 5.4:0.6:1.
