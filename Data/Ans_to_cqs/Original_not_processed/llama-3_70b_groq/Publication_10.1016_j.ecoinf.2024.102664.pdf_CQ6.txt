Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of different models, and the potential for future improvements. It does not provide information on data preprocessing, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study. It is possible that the authors assumed that the readers are familiar with common preprocessing techniques or that they did not consider it relevant to mention in the provided context.
