Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the model training is related to the calculation of ecosystem services demand and landscape connectivity index. However, the context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.

The text only discusses the calculation of various indices such as source coverage area, source coverage rate, source connectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC, but it does not mention any postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
