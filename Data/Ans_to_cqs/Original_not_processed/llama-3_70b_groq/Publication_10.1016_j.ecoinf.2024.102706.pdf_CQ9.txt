Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a specific platform where the deep learning pipeline data is stored or shared. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and results of a study that compares the performance of different machine learning models in predicting forest canopy cover. It provides details on the models used, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information about a data repository or a specific platform where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
