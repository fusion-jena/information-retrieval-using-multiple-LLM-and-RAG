Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that various transformations (flipping, brightness, and contrast modifications) were applied to the images to improve training. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was performed, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved, but I can infer that some form of data augmentation was performed.
