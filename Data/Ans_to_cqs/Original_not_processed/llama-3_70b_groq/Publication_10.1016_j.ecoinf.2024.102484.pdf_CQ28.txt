Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning in the paper by Huang et al. (2019), but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
