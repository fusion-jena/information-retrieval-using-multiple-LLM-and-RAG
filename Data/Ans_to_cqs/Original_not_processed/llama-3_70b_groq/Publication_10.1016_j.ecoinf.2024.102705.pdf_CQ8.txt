Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the concept of deep learning, its application in ecological tasks, and a proposed method for adaptive image processing. The references cited are academic papers and conferences, but there is no mention of a code repository or a specific implementation of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository.
