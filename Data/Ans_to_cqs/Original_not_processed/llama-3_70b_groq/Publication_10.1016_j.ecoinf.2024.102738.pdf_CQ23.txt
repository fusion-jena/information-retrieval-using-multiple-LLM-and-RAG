Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the sampling strategy used for the training and testing samples. According to the text, the authors relied on Chuvieco (2020) and Congalton (1991) to determine the sampling size and validation areas. They implemented an alternative strategy that involved selecting pure training areas with at least 50 pixels per thematic class, using simplified random sampling. This approach was intended to capture variability within each class and improve the model's performance.

While the context does not mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of simplified random sampling and the selection of pure training areas with a minimum of 50 pixels per class may help to ensure the generalizability of the model to some extent. However, without further information, it is unclear whether the authors used other measures to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation or ensemble methods.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information about the diversity of the dataset, such as whether it includes data from different regions, seasons, or sensors. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the generalizability of the model based on the provided information.
