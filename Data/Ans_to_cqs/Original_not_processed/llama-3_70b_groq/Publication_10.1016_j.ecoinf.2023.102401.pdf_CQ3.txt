Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on data augmentation techniques, which are used to expand the dataset and improve the model's performance. The data augmentation techniques mentioned include HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking. These techniques are used to introduce diversity into the training dataset, enabling the model to learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
