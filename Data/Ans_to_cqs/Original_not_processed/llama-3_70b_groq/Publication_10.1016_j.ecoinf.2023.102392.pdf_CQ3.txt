Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, for object recognition, categorization, and land use/land cover classification. It discusses the accuracy of the XGBoost model in classifying forest types and land use/land cover, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
