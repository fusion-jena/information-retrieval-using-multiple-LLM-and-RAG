Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, hyperparameters, learning rates, or optimizers. The text appears to be discussing metadata templates for measurement data, including installation details, measurement settings, and data file descriptions. It also mentions model parameterization in the context of earth system models, but does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
