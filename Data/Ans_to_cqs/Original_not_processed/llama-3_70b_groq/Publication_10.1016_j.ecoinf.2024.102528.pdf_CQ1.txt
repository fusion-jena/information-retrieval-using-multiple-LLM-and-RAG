Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for continuous bioacoustic monitoring of bird species, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected. It is possible that the data is collected through passive acoustic monitoring, as mentioned in the keywords, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
