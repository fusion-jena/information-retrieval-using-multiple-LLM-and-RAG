Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context provides a general overview of neural networks, deep learning, and the architecture of the GoogLeNet model used in the coral reef fish detection and recognition task. It also explains the concept of neural networks, activation functions, and the learning process. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model.
