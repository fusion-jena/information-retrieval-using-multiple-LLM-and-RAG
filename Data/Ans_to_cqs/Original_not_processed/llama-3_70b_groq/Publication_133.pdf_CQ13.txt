Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context focuses on the training process, loss function, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of the YOLOv5 model, which is a specific deep learning architecture. The YOLOv5 model is an open-source implementation available on GitHub (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0), and the hyperparameters used in the model can be found in the implementation details.

If you need to know the specific hyperparameters used in the model, I recommend checking the YOLOv5 implementation on GitHub or referring to the original paper that introduced the YOLOv5 model.
