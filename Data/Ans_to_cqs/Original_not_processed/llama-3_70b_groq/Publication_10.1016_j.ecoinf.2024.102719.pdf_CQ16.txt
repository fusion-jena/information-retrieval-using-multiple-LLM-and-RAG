Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the optimization of hyperparameters, the use of ensemble models, and the evaluation of machine learning models, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular case.
