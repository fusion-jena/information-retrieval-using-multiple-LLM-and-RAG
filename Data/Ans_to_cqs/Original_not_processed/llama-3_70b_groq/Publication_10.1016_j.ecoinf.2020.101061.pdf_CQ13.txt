Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the number of epochs used for training (5 epochs for pretraining and 40 epochs for retraining) and the use of data augmentation (random flips and translations), but it does not provide information about other hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
