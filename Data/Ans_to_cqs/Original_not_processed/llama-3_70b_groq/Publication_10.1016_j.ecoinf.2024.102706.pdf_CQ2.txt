Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically nadir photographs. This is mentioned in the sentence "ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs using deep convolutional neural networks." Additionally, the context also mentions the use of Planet data, which is likely to be satellite or aerial imagery. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store or process the output of the machine learning models, such as the predicted canopy cover values.
