Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. It only discusses the architecture and performance of the CNNFAST network and compares it with other methods, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
