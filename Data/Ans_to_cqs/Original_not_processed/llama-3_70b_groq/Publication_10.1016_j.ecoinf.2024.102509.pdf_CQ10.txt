Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to agroforestry, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
