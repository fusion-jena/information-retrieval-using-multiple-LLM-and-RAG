Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in this study is through public datasets, specifically from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository. The text states, "As species observation data, we use data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) improved with reliable records we accurately and directly observed in the field." This suggests that the researchers are leveraging existing datasets from GBIF, which are then supplemented with their own field observations to ensure data accuracy.

Additionally, the text mentions plans for a new data census and collection campaign, which will utilize other public FAIR data repositories, such as those from the Tuscany Region administration and Copernicus. This implies that the researchers are also exploring other public datasets to augment their data collection.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors as data collection methods in the provided context.
