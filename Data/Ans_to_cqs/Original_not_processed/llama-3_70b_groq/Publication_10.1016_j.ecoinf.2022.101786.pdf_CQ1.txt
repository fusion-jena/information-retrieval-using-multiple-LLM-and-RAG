Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea, model parameters, and annotations used for training, validation, and testing datasets. It also provides background information on the importance of understanding the deep sea ecosystem and the need for effective conservation strategies.

However, it can be inferred that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, and Biigle annotations were used to label images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of large marine image collections, which might suggest that the raw data is collected through underwater cameras or sensors. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not specified.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and more information would be needed to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
