Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the training time, prediction time, and optimization time for different models, as well as the hardware used for training and prediction. It also provides details on the XGBoost model parameters and the process of tuning them using grid search functions to find the optimal value based on the test error metric. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
