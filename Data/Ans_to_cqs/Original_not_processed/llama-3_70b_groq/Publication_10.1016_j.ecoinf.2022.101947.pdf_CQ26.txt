Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of the FIT algorithm for population estimation using footprint trails and its validation using a holdback trial partitioning test. It discusses the optimal classification accuracy obtained when the test set size is smallest relative to the training set and the robustness of the model. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The context does not provide any information on stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias.
