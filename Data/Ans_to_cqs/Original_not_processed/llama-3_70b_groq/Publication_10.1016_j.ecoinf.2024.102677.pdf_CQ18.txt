Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to continuously assess the model accuracy using the validation set. This is mentioned in the text as "The model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training..." This approach allows the model's performance to be evaluated on unseen data (validation set) during the training process, helping to identify overfitting or underfitting issues and adjust the model accordingly.
