Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be related to geospatial modeling, machine learning, and spatial sampling, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
