Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning model training or the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a research paper on predicting suitable areas for orchids under land cover and climate change, and it discusses the use of an ensemble model incorporating Random Forest and Support Vector Machine components. The data is split into 80% for building the model and 20% for testing, but this is not related to deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
