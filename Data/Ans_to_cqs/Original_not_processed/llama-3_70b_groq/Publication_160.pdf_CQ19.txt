Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, such as ResNet architectures, batch sizes, and performance metrics, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
