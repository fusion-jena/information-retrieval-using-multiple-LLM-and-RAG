Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the compilation and processing of GIS data, the use of machine learning ensembles, and the training of models using presence/absence data for Short-billed Gulls. It does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when the training process is complete.

However, it is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or convergence of model parameters to determine when training is complete. These criteria help to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is adequately trained. Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on the criteria used in this particular study.
