Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model, hardware resources, GPUs, or TPUs. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distributions, and environmental variables, with references to scientific papers and datasets. There is no mention of deep learning or hardware resources, so it is not possible to determine which hardware resources are used for training a deep learning model.
