Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and its application to ecological informatics, land use/land cover mapping, and honey bee flight time and performance. There is no mention of deep learning or hardware resources used for training a model.
