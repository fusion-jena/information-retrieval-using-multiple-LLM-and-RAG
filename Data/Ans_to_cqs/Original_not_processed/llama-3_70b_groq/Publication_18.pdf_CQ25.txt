Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is for image classification and object detection in images. In image classification, the CNN model analyzes the input image and produces a label that describes its visual content, along with a probability that expresses the confidence of the model. In object detection, the CNN detection model not only produces the correct label but also determines the region in the input image where the target object is located by means of a bounding box.
