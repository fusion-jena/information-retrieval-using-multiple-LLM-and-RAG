Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model, specifically the BatNet, is designed to identify tropical bat species based on their calls. The model is trained on a reference dataset and is used to extract acoustic features from spectrum images. The goal is to automatically process and identify bat calls, which can be applied to biodiversity metrics and monitoring protocols. The model is a classification model, as it aims to classify the input bat calls into different species categories.
