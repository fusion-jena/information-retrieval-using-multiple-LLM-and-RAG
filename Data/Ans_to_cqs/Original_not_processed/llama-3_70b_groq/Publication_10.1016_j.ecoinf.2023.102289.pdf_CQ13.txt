Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model (deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269), the functionality of LaDeco, and the computational efficiency of the system. It also mentions the use of MXNet and GluonCV, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
