Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a different type of machine learning approach, involving methods like knn, LoopT, and lasso regularization, and evaluating their performance using metrics like sumNIMSE and meanRSS. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques specific to deep learning.
