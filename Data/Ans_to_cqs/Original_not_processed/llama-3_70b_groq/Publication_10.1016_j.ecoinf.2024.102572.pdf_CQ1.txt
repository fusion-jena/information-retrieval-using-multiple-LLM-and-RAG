Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through the use of satellite photos, specifically high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite photos. These photos are incorporated into a cloud platform, where machine learning techniques are applied to classify fire-damaged monuments and quantify carbon emissions from forest fires.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. However, it is mentioned that the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python is used to retrieve necessary picture data for forest fire point information in the study area. This suggests that the raw data may be collected from public datasets or APIs that provide access to satellite imagery.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a research center and a published dataset with a universal relevance, which may imply that the raw data is collected from a combination of sources, including public datasets and APIs. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
