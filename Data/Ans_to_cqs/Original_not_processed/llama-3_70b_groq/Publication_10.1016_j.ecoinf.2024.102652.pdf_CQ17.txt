Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the training process, including data normalization and standardization, batch size, optimizer, learning rate, and loss function. However, it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
