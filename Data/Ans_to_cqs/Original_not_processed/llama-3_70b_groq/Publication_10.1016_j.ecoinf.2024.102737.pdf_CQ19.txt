Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the implementations are taken from the open sources of Choi, (2020) and Siyah, (2020), but it does not specify whether these implementations are based on TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
