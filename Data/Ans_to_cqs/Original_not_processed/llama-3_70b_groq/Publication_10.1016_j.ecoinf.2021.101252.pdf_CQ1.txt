Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, the importance of hyperparameters, and the AutoML procedure. It also mentions the use of time series data, climate data, and optoacoustic signal processing, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected.

However, based on the mentioned applications and data types, it can be inferred that various methods might be used to collect raw data, such as:

* Surveys: possibly used to collect data on ecological phenomena, species distribution, or climate patterns.
* Sensors: might be used to collect climate data, optoacoustic signals, or other environmental data.
* Public datasets: could be used as a source of raw data, especially for time series data or climate data.

But, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
