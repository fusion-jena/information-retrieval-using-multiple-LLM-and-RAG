Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is twofold: segmentation and classification. The segmentation model is used to separate individual fishes from the rest of the image, as shown in Fig. 3. The classification model, on the other hand, is used to classify the segmented fishes by species. The classification model is a residual neural network (ResNet50V2) that has been pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset.
