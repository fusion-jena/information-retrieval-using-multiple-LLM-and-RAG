Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It discusses the development of a spatial modeling approach for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) on reclaimed spoil heap, using remote sensing data and topographic indices. The context mentions the potential of testing advanced methods of data analysis, including machine learning or deep neural networks, in the future, but it does not specify a particular type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
