Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc. The context only discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for hyperspectral image classification, the experiment setup, and references to other related works. It does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
