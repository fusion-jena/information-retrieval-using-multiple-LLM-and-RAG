Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about optimizing hyperparameters of a model, nor does it mention any specific model or machine learning algorithm being used. The context appears to be discussing drought characteristics, drought indices, and groundwater storage variations, but it does not provide information on how hyperparameters of a model are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
