Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model's prediction capabilities, data limitations, and implications for policy-making authorities.

However, it does mention the use of a threshold corresponding to the value over which the model correctly predicted all training presence locations as the optimal decision threshold for dichotomic classification of suitable/unsuitable locations. This suggests that some form of evaluation or validation of the model's performance was conducted, but the specific postprocessing steps are not detailed.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
