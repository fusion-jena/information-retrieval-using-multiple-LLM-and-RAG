Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. The validation set, consisting of 607 images (13% of the total data), is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, the model's hyperparameters can be adjusted to optimize its performance, and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data can be monitored.
