Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, urban heat-prone areas, and ecosystem health benefits, with references to various research papers on topics such as habitat suitability, wild rabbit conservation, and optimization algorithms. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
