Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of GPUs and parallel computing in ecology and machine learning, citing various research papers and software tools. It mentions applications of machine learning in ecology, such as image and audio classification, but does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
