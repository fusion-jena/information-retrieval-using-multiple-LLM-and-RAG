Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights, fine-tuning of network models, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
