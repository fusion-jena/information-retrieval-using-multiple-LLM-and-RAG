Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models, sampling bias, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models or the measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

The context does mention model evaluation and the use of indicators such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the effectiveness of bias correction methods. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
