Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set, but it does not provide the specific values or types of hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
