Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the data augmentation techniques used to enhance the training set, which can also help prevent overfitting. These techniques include flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels while the labels remain unchanged, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°, and randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. 

It is possible that other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
