Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is used to detect wildebeest within survey images. The model employed is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a type of object detection algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of images and is used to identify the locations of potential objects (wildebeest) within each image.
