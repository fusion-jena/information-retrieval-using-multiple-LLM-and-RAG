Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the active learning experiments, sampling strategies, and the use of a transfer learning model (BirdNet-1) as the embedding model. It discusses the different sampling strategies explored, such as uncertainty and diversity-based methods, myopic and adaptive methods, and their combinations. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
