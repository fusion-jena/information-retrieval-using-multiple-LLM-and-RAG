Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the creation of spectrograms, metadata files, and the training of a CNN and k-NN model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
