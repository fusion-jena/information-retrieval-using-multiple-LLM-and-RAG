Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. It only mentions that the CNN architecture used is the inception model extended with batch normalization, and that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques used in the pipeline.
