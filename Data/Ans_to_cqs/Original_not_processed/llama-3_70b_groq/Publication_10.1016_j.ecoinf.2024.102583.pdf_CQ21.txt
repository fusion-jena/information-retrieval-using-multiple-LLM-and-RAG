Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on different machine learning models and their applications in landslide susceptibility mapping, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps that may be involved after model training include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. to evaluate the model's performance.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.
* Saliency maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the most important features or inputs contributing to the model's predictions.
* Model interpretation: This involves analyzing the model's decisions and understanding how it is using the input features to make predictions.
* Model validation: This involves evaluating the model's performance on a hold-out test dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps and may not be specific to the context provided.
