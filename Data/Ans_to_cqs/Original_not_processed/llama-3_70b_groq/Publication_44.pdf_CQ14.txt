Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and the Proposed Method, and provides their performance metrics, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. It mentions the use of a validation loss to select the best-performing model, but it does not specify the method used to search for the optimal hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
