Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. It only mentions that a YOLOv6 model is used, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. YOLOv6 is a deep learning architecture, not a framework, and it can be implemented using various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
