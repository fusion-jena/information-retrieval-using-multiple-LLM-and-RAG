Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is mentioned in the conclusion section (3.4) where it is stated that "Object detection models facilitate the handling of multiple species in images and can effectively eliminate background pixels from subsequent classification tasks." This suggests that the deep learning model is being used for object detection, specifically for detecting multiple species in images.
