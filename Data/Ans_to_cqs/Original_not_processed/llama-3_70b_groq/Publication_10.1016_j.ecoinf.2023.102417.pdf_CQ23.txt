Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does highlight the importance of creating specific datasets tailored to the desired application to address the issue of data drift or domain drift. This suggests that the authors are aware of the need to ensure the model's transferability across different datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions the application of deep learning models in long-term biomonitoring, which implies that the model should be able to generalize well across different recording conditions, devices, and sensors. However, it does not provide specific details on the measures taken to achieve this generalizability, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
