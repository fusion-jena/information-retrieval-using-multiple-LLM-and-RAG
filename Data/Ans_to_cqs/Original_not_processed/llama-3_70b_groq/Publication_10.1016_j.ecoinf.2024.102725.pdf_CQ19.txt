Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses various research papers and studies related to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data reconstruction, gap-filling, and time-series analysis using different methods and techniques. However, it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
