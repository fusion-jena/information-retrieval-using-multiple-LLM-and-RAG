Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training data generation, neural network implementation, and tuning of the U-Net-like CNN architecture. It discusses the experimental setup, hyperparameter tuning, and the selection of the best-performing model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
