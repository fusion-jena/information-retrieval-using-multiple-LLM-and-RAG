Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the network was trained using a validation data set, and the lowest error was chosen. This implies that the data was split into at least two sets: a training set and a validation set. The context does not provide information on how the data was split or what criteria were used to determine the proportion of data allocated to each set.

It is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific criteria used in this case.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this case.
