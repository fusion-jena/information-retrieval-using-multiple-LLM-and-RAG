Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architectures, and their performance on the ImageNet dataset. It discusses the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, batch normalization, and the number of epochs for training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
