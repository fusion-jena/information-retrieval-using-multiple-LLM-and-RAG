Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using cross-validation and grid search methods. It discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning in optimizing model performance and preventing overfitting or underfitting issues. 

However, it does not provide specific information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, early stopping, or convergence thresholds. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
