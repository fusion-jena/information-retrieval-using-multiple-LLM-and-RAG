Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation as a preprocessing step.

In the context, data augmentation is performed on the audio samples to generate a more robust training set. The transformations are made on the audios, and later, these transformations are reflected in the mel-spectrogram images. This suggests that the mel-spectrogram images are used as input to the CNN model, but the context does not provide further details on any additional preprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that data augmentation is one of the preprocessing steps involved, but it is unclear whether other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning are performed.
