Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to forest management and inventory estimation, and does not mention deep learning or randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various estimators (e.g., inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, NN4) and their performance in reducing index variance and bias in the context of forest diversity indices. There is no mention of deep learning, random seed values, or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
