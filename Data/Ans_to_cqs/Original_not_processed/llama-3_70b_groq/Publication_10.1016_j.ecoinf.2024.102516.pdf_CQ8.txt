Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only provides information about the research paper, including the abstract, keywords, and references, as well as some details about the network setup and baseline comparison. There is no mention of a code repository or a specific platform where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
