Answer:::

According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the stabilization of the validation loss. As mentioned in Figure 2, the validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, suggesting that further training might lead to overfitting. This implies that the model's performance on the validation set has reached a plateau, indicating that the training is complete.

In addition, the context also mentions that the model's average precision (AP) improves with the number of training epochs, and the plot depicts the model's mean AP (mAP) over the three insect classes. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training, and when the improvement in AP or mAP slows down or plateaus, it can be an indication that the training is complete.

However, it is not explicitly stated in the context what specific threshold or criteria are used to determine when the validation loss has plateaued or the AP/mAP has converged.
