Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically spectrograms, as input to the CNN model. The text mentions "grayscale input spectrograms" and "mapping grayscale input spectrograms to a color scheme" which suggests that the model is trained on image-like representations of audio data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
