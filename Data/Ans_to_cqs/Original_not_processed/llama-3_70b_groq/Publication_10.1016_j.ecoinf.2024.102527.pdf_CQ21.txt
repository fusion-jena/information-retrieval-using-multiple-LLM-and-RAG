Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, hyper-parameters, and experimental results of transfer learning tasks. It discusses the training process, optimizer, and hyper-parameter settings, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated on the test set, and the results were presented in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the binomial test probability values were calculated to compare the performance of different transfer strategies. But, the context does not provide detailed information about any postprocessing steps beyond these evaluations.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
