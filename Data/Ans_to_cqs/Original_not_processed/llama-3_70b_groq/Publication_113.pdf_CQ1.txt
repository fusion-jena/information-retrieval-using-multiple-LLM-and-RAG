Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a specific dataset called "Snapshot Serengeti" which is a collection of high-frequency annotated camera trap images of 40 mammalian species in an African savanna. This suggests that camera traps can be one method used for collecting raw data, at least in the context of wildlife monitoring or computer vision applications.

Additionally, the context mentions "large camera trap datasets" and "NACTI dataset", which implies that camera trap data is being used as a source of raw data. However, it does not provide information on other methods that might be used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or sensors.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that camera traps are one method used for collecting raw data, but it is unclear what other methods might be utilized.
