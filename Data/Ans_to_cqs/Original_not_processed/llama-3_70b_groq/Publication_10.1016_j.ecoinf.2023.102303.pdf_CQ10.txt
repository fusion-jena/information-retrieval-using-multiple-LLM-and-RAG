Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the development of novel deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters, the creation of a weakly-labeled dataset, and the application of semi-supervised and weakly-supervised approaches. However, it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the implementation of the deep learning pipeline.
