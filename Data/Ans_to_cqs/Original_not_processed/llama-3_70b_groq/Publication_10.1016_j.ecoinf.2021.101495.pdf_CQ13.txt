Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially provided in Table 2. The table shows the search space and best assignments for the hyperparameters of the neural networks for both segmentation and classification tasks.

For the segmentation model, the best assignments are:

* Epochs: 15,000
* Batch size: 500
* Learning rate: 0.008
* Activation function: Softmax
* Train/test split: 0.9/0.1

For the classification model, the best assignments are:

* Epochs: Not specified
* Batch size: 4
* Learning rate: 0.0001
* Activation function: Softmax
* Train/test split: 0.8/0.2

The optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common to use optimizers such as Adam, SGD, or RMSProp in deep learning models, but without further information, it is impossible to determine which one was used in this specific case.

It is also worth noting that the classification model is based on a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model, which may have its own set of hyperparameters that are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
