Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms in water quality modeling and the advantages of using these algorithms over empirical and semi-analytical methods. It discusses the use of randomized grid search for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
