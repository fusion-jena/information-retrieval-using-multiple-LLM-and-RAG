Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model explained 91% of the yield variation, which suggests that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of its ability to explain the variation in the target variable (yield). 

Additionally, the context mentions Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values for other models, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models. MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, while R2 measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). 

However, it is not clear if these metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model specifically. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
