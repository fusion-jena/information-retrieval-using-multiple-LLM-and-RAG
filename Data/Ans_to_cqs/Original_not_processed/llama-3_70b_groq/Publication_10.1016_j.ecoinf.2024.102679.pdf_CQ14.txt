Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the fine-tuning process, the training procedure, and the model's performance on the validation set, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
