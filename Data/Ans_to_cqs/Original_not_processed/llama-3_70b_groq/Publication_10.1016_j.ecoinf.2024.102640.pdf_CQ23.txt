Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in GreenCam, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was constructed to include a wider range of urban settings, such as different types of green spaces (parks, gardens, campuses, urban forests, etc.) and varying levels of urban green density. This expanded geographic scope of data collection aimed to increase the diversity of the dataset. 

Additionally, data augmentation techniques were implemented to address underrepresented classes and improve the balance of the dataset. These techniques included random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images, which helped the model generalize better without compromising the diversity of the dataset. 

Furthermore, the authors are in the process of expanding the dataset to include photos from different cities and climates, which will enrich the dataset with a broader range of urban environmental conditions. Capturing images across all seasons is also planned to increase diversity. 

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
