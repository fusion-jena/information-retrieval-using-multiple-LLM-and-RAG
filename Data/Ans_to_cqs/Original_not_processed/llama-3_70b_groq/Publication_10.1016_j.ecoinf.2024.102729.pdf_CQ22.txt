Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for a random forest (RF) model, which are:

* adj_R2 (adjusted R-squared)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the RF model in predicting chlorophyll a concentrations. However, it is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as the context does not provide specific information about the evaluation of a deep learning model.
