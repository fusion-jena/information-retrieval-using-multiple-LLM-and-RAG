Answer:::
The context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is textual data, as the pipeline is designed for text classification and the data collection scenario involves collecting social media posts and web articles. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that the annotated data points are stored in a CSV file or a similar format. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
