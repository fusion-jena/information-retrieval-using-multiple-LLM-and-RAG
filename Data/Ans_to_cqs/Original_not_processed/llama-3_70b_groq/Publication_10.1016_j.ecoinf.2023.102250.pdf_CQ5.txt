Answer::: 
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context mentions various datasets such as Ori, G1_Dataset1, G1_Dataset2, ..., G3_Dataset3, and their mixup versions (G3_Dataset1_mixup, G3_Dataset2_mixup, G3_Dataset3_mixup). These datasets seem to be specific to the birdsong classification task and are not widely known datasets.
