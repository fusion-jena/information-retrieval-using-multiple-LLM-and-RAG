Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, in the deconvolutional network section (4.2), it is mentioned that the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. This implies that the model's performance is being monitored on the validation set during training, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly.
