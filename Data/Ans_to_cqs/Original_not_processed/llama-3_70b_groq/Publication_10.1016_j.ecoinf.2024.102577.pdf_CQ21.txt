Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the validation of the trained models and the calculation of mean accuracies and their standard deviations. 

It can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the mean accuracies and standard deviations are calculated. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

Therefore, the answer is that the context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, except for the calculation of mean accuracies and their standard deviations.
