Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the development of a deep learning model for air quality monitoring and prediction, its evaluation, and the proposed framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Although the context mentions MLOps (Model maintenance in the production environment) in the analytics layer, which encompasses automation and monitoring steps such as continuous integration, deployment, and training on data collected in production, it does not provide specific details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
