Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models and their applications in predicting water quality, stream flow, and other related aspects. It discusses various models, such as boosted regression trees, random forests, decision trees, extreme learning machines, support vector machines, and ensemble models, as well as hyperparameter tuning for some of these models.

However, it does mention the use of ensemble techniques, such as bagging and combining weak learners, to reduce overfitting and strengthen prediction models. Additionally, it notes the importance of selecting refined hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy and predictive capabilities.

While the context does not specifically address data bias or preprocessing techniques, it implies the importance of careful model selection and hyperparameter tuning to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. It does not provide information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias.
