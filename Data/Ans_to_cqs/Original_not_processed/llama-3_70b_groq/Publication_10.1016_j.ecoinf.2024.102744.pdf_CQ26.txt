Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the classification network, evaluation metrics, and detection results of the pollen-bearing bee detection task. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of focal loss, which can help mitigate class imbalance issues. Focal loss assigns more weight to misclassified samples, which can help the model focus on harder examples and reduce the impact of class imbalance. But this is not a traditional data preprocessing technique to address data bias.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
