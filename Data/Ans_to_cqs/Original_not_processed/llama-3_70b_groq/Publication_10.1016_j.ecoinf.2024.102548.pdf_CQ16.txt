Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that each model underwent training for 10 epochs, which suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau.

It's possible that the authors used a different stopping criterion, such as a maximum training time or a target accuracy threshold, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
