Answer:::

I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, sampling bias, and correcting the effects of sampling bias in species distribution modeling. It discusses the importance of sample size, the limitations of datasets, and a new method for correcting sampling bias in species distribution modeling. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
