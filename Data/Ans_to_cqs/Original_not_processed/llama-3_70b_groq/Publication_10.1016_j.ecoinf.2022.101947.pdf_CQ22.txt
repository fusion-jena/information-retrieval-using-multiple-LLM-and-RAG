Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. In Section 3.4, it is mentioned that "The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers giving 100% accuracy." This suggests that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
