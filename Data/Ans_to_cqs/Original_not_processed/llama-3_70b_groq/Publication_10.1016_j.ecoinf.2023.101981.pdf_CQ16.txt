Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a model or determining when training is complete. The context appears to be discussing the analysis of cow calls using software called Kaleidoscope and a recorder called Song Meter SM2. It discusses the measurement of signal parameters and the introduction of adequate parameters in Kaleidoscope, but it does not mention training a model or validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
