Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of Earth Observation (EO) satellites. The context mentions the EECE (not defined in the provided text) and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository, which suggests that the raw data is collected from satellite imagery.

The text states that users can retrieve the EOS data catalogue from the GEE online repository, which implies that the raw data is collected from satellite images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of ee.ImageCollection() constructor, which is a method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for collecting and processing satellite imagery.

It does not mention surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does mention that the GEE platform has the capacity to store data from multiple satellites, which suggests that the raw data is collected from a variety of satellite sources.

In summary, based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of Earth Observation (EO) satellites, specifically through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository.
