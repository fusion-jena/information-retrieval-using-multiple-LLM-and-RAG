Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of validation datasets. The model is trained for 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images. The loss values for both training and validation datasets are calculated and compared during each epoch. This allows the model's performance to be monitored and evaluated during the training process. The loss values include the total loss, RPN anchor classifier loss, RPN bounding box loss, loss for the classifier head of Mask R-CNN, loss for Mask R-CNN bounding box refinement, and mask binary cross-entropy loss. By monitoring these loss values, the model's performance can be evaluated and adjusted accordingly.
