Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the UNet model, the EfficientNet-B5 feature extractor, and the training process, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
