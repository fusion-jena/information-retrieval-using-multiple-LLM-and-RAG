Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on downscaling climate data, species distribution models, and comparing the performance of different algorithms for climate data downscaling. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the use of different algorithms such as Random Forest, Generalized Boosting Models, and Artificial Neural Networks, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps for these models.
