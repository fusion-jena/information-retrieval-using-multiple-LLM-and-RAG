Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of CNN and RNN. Specifically, it is a Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Network (HARHN) model, which consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder part uses a convolutional layer and a recurrent layer (RHN) to generate a latent representation, and a layer of Hierarchical Attention weighs the importance of this representation. The decoder part processes this representation with the past history of the target variable using an RHN layer to predict the future concentration of 137Cs.
