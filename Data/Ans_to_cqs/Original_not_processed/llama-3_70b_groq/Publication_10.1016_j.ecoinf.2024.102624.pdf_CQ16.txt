Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the classification and regression training process, including data splitting, 10-fold cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. It discusses the importance of accuracy assessment and strategies to improve classification accuracy, but it does not provide specific information on when to stop training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
