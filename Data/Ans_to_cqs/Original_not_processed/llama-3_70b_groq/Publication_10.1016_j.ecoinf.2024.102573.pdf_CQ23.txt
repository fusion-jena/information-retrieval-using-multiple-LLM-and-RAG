Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the test results of different frontends, the performance gap between learnable and traditional frontends, and the importance of each component (PCEN, normalization, and data augmentation) in the model. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
