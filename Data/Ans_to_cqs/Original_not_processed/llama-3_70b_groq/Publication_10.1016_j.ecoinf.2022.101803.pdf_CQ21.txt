Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using the out-of-sample R2 metric. The median of k-1 out-of-sample R2's is calculated for each number of iterations to pick the best number of iterations.

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation (other than R2), or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. The focus of the provided context appears to be on model training and hyperparameter tuning using k-fold cross-validation, rather than on postprocessing steps.
