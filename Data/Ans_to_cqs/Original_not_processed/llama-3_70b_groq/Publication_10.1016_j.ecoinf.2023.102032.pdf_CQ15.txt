Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to cloud detection and wetland use intensity calculation using Sentinel-2 data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It discusses the use of the s2cloudless algorithm and its parameters for cloud probability, near-infrared reflectance, and cloud edge dilation, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
