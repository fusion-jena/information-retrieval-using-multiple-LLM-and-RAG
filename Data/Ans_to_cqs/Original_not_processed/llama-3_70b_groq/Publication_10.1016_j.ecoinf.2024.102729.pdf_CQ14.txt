Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the RF model with 25 trees as hyper-parameters achieved the highest accuracy. It does not provide information on whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
