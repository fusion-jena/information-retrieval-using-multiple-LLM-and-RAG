Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the development of a workflow for automatic classification of small mammal camera trap images using a deep neural network in R, but it does not provide a link to a data repository where the pipeline is stored. The authors mention that they provide R scripts for all steps of the workflow, but they do not specify a repository where these scripts can be accessed.
