Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to landscape planning, ecology, and environmental performance evaluation, with references to convolutional neural networks and 3D landscape indexes. However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
