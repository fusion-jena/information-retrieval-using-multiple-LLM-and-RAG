Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using a metric that originates from hydrology and related environmental sciences, which considers the correlation, variability, and bias of the tested model. This suggests that the metric used might be the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) or a similar metric that is commonly used in hydrology and environmental sciences to evaluate the performance of models. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact metric used.
