Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on the mean squared error, but it does not provide information on when the training is considered complete. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
