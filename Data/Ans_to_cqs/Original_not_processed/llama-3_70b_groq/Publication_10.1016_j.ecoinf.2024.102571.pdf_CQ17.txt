Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to environmental and water pollution topics, with references to research papers on greenhouse gas emissions, wastewater treatment, and nitrogen and phosphate in urban wastewater. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
