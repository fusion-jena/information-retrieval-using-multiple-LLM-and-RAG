Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS) algorithm, which combines manual and random search methods for hyperparameter tuning. 

However, it can be inferred that the HHOS algorithm inherently involves randomness through its random search component. The random search iteratively samples various combinations of hyperparameter values identified in the manual search. This implies that the algorithm is designed to handle randomness to some extent, but the specific strategies employed to do so are not explicitly stated.

It is also worth noting that the context highlights the importance of considering the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset, which may be related to randomness in the data. However, this is not directly addressing the query about strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In conclusion, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it is unclear what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
