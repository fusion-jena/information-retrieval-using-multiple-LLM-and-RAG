Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, known as folds, for conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This implies that the data was split into folds for cross-validation, but the specific criteria used for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not mentioned.
