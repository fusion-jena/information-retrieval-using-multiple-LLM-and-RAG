Answer:::
The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a MaxEnt model, which is a type of species distribution model, and discusses the use of environmental and territorial variables to predict the distribution of Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex.

However, it does mention a "30 random test percentage" in the first sentence, which suggests that 30% of the data was randomly selected for testing, but it does not provide information on how the remaining data was split for training and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation in this specific context.
