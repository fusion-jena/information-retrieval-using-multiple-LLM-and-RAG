Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the hybrid MCMC algorithm, its steps, and its application to a physiologically based model. It discusses the algorithm's components, including the Least Squares approach and the Metropolis-Hastings-like algorithm, as well as the calculation of the a posteriori distribution of parameters. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps typically used in machine learning or model evaluation.
