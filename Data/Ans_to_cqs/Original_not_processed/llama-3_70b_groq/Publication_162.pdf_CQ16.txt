Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses various aspects of wildlife classification, such as active learning, novelty detection, and lifelong learning, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

The context does mention evaluation metrics such as AP50, AP75, and AP, which are used to evaluate the performance of the classification model. However, it does not specify how these metrics are used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
