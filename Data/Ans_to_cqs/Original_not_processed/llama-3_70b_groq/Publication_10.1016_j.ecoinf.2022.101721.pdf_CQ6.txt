Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on bat call detection and classification using convolutional neural networks, and it discusses the importance of using real-world examples to evaluate the performance of the model. It also mentions the use of R-code and QGIS, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
