Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on environmental pollution, water quality management, and machine learning applications in these areas. It discusses methods like MIC (Maximal Information Coefficient) analysis and Random Forest analysis, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
