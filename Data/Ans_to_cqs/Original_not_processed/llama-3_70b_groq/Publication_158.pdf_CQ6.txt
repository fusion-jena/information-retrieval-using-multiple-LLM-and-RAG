Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation as a preprocessing step to enhance sample variation. The data augmentation techniques used include:

* Rotation
* Reflectance bias of ±10%
* Random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image

These techniques are applied to the input images to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness. No other preprocessing steps are mentioned in the provided context.
