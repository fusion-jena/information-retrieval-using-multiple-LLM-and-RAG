Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references from various academic papers and journals, but it does not contain any information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The references seem to be related to topics such as water quality assessment, machine learning, and environmental science, but there is no mention of a code repository or a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
