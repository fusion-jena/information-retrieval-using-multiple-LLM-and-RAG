Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the model, including the use of Faster R-CNN, Region Proposal Network (RPN), and cloud computing, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
