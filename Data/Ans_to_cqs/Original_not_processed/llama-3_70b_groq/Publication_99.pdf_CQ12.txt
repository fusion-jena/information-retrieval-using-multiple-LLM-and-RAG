Answer:::
Answer: The pipeline uses various types of deep learning models, including CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and PConv networks, which are a type of CNN. Specifically, the models mentioned in the context are PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks, which are all variants of CNNs. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) or Transformer models in the provided context.
