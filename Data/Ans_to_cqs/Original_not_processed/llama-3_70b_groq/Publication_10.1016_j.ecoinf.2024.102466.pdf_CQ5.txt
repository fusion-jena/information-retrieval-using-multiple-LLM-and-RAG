Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This dataset is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a specific dataset collected for the purpose of this study on bird object detection.
