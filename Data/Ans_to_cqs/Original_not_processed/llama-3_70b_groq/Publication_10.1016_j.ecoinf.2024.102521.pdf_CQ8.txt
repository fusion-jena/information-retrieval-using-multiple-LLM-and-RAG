Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It describes various research papers and projects related to using deep learning for insect detection and monitoring, but it does not provide information about the availability of the code or its repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
