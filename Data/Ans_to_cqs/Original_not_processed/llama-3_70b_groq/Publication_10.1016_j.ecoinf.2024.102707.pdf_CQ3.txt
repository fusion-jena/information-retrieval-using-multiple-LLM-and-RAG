Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, with a focus on Antarctica and seabirds. While some of the references may involve deep learning or machine learning methods, there is no explicit mention of data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
