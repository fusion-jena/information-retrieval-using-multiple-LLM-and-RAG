Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the active learning experiments, transfer learning models, and annotation of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) datasets, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. It only mentions the use of pre-existing datasets, such as AnuraSet, but does not elaborate on how the data was originally collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
