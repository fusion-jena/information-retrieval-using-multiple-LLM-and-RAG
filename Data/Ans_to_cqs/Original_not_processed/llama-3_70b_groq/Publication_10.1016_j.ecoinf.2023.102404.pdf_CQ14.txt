Answer::: 
Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. This is stated in the context as "we adopted a grid search approach to optimize the reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that provides the most stable and reliable results." This approach involves exhaustively testing all possible combinations of predefined parameter values and evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation techniques. The goal is to minimize the RMSE and achieve the most accurate predictions.
