Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on individual tree detection and segmentation in mangrove forests using various algorithms, including deep learning methods like Faster R-CNN and PointNet.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (with momentum) as an optimization algorithm during the training of the Faster R-CNN detector. This implies that some form of randomness is involved in the training process, but the specific strategies for handling randomness are not discussed.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ techniques such as fixing random seed values, using reproducible random number generators, and averaging model predictions over multiple runs to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
