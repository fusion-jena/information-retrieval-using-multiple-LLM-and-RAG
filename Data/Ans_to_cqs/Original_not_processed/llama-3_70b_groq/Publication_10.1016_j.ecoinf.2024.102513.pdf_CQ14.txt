Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a neural network model, discussing the equation for a neuron and the role of the pooling layer, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
