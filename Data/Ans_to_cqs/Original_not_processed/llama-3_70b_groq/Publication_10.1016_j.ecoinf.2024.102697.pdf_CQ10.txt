Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and articles related to remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental science. None of the provided texts mention a specific code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
