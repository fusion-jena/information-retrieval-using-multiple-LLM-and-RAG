Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning models used in the pipeline include LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is mentioned in the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023) titled "Comparative evaluation of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches." However, there is no mention of a Transformer model being used in the pipeline.
