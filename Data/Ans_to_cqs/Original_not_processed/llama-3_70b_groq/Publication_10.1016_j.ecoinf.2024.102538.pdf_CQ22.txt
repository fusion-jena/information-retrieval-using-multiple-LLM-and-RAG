Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: mean reciprocal rank (MRR), accuracy (ACC), and hierarchical distance of a mistake (HDM). Additionally, an average accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC) is also calculated to evaluate the efficacy of the hierarchical classification.
