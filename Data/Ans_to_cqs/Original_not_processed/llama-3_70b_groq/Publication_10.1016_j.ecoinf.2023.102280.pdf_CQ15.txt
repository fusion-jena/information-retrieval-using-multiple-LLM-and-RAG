Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the learning rate of 5e-4 and learning rate decay after the first 30 epochs, which suggests that some form of learning rate scheduling is used. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm itself, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
