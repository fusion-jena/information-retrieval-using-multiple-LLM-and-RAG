Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing hyper-parameters, dataset configurations, and the performance of different network architectures on various datasets. It discusses the use of transfer learning, fine-tuning, and freezing feature extraction layers, but it does not provide information on the training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
