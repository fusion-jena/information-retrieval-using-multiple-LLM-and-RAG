Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to water quality monitoring and algal bloom prediction, but it does not include any references to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
