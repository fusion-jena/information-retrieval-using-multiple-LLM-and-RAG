Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses the FAIR assessment of datasets using the F-UJI tool, which evaluates the datasets based on 16 metrics distributed among four principles. The results are visualized using a computational notebook report, but there is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
