Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the hyperparameters used in traditional machine learning models such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM, which are listed in Table 3. It also mentions the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
