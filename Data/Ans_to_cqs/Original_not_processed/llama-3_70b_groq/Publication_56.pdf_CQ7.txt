Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "70% of the data were used for training the algorithms whereas the remaining 30% were used only for validation." This implies that the data was split into two sets: a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). There is no mention of a test set.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on how the data was split, such as whether it was done randomly or based on certain characteristics of the data. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
