Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the creation and evaluation of climate models, including the use of training and evaluation sets, metrics for assessing model performance, and ensemble modeling approaches. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
