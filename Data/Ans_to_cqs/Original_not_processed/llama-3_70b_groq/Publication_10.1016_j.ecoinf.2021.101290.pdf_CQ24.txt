Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on various topics like event-stream processing, machine learning, computer vision, and optogenetics, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention deep learning in a few instances, such as in the paper by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015) and in the comparison of deep learning frameworks by Kovalev, Kalinovsky, and Kovalev (2016). Nevertheless, these mentions do not provide insight into handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning involves techniques like fixing random seed values, using reproducible random number generators, and employing regularization techniques to reduce overfitting. However, these strategies are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
