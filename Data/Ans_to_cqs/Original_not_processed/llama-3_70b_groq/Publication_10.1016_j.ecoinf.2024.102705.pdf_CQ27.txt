Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, evaluation metrics, and the proposed method for adaptive image processing embedding. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The implementation details section (3.1) discusses the training protocol, data augmentation techniques, and the training process, but it does not mention model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
