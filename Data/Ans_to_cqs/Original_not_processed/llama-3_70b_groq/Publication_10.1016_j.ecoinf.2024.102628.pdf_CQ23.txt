Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was expanded by incorporating multi-temporal data, which tripled the image pool for each transect. This was done by drawing data from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments. This approach helped to increase the diversity of the dataset, which is essential for training effective deep learning models.

Another measure taken was the use of cross-validation, specifically the Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) approach. In this approach, a complete 450m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training process and subsequently tested. This ensured that every multitemporal transect underwent testing, which helped to assess the model's performance and accounted for the data constraints.

Additionally, the model was retrained for each fold, preventing previous fold's information from being transferred. This further helped to ensure that the model was not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and was generalizing well to new, unseen data.

It is worth noting that stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the use of cross-validation and the LOGO approach helped to ensure that the model was evaluated on a diverse range of data, which is similar to the concept of stratified splitting.

Overall, the measures taken helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by increasing the diversity of the dataset, using cross-validation, and preventing overfitting.
