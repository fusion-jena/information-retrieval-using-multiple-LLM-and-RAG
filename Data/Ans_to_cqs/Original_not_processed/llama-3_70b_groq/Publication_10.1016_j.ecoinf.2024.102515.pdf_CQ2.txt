Answer: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the pipeline are JSON and image formats (excluding GIF). The text mentions that the Twitter API returns data in JSON format, which is handled by the twarc2 library. Additionally, the flowchart in Fig. 1 shows that images are processed as part of the tweet detection algorithm, but GIF images are excluded in the filtering process. There is no mention of audio or video formats being used in the pipeline. CSV format is also not mentioned.
