Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the calculation and storage of training loss and accuracy for each epoch. This is evident from steps 3, 25, 26, and 27 in the provided algorithm. 

In step 3, empty lists are initialized to store the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. Then, in steps 25 and 26, the predicted labels for the current mini-batch are calculated, and the loss between the predicted labels and the true labels is calculated. The gradients are backpropagated, and the model parameters are updated using the optimizer. 

Finally, in step 27, the total loss and total correct predictions are updated. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored during training by tracking the loss and accuracy at each epoch.
