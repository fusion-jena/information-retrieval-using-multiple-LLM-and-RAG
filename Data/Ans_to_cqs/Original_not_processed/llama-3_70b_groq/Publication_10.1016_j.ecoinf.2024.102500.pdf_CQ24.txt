Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or mention random seed values. However, it does touch on randomness in the context of machine learning algorithms, particularly in ensemble methods like Bagging (BG), Random Forest (RF), and Extremely Randomized Trees (ET).

In these methods, bootstrapping is used to enhance diversity and randomness in tree construction. The bootstrap parameter is crucial in these ensemble methods. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Python library's randint command to pick integers within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth, and the uniform command for discrete or continuous values inside a range, like the min_samples_split hyperparameter.

While these mentions of randomness are related to machine learning algorithms, they do not specifically address strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a direct answer to the query.
