Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for classification accuracy. In Section 3.3.1, it is mentioned that "we focus on general trends in commonly reported metrics" and that "high classification accuracy values for DL models in problems of ecological interest" have been reported. Additionally, in Section 4.2.1, it is mentioned that ConvNeXt obtained the highest accuracy (79.58%) and that FPR (False Positive Rate) values for the larger classes are also considered. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, I can only confirm that classification accuracy and FPR are two of the metrics used, but I do not know the complete list of metrics used.
