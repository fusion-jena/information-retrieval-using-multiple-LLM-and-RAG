Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to groundwater-climate interactions, machine learning, and satellite observations, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
