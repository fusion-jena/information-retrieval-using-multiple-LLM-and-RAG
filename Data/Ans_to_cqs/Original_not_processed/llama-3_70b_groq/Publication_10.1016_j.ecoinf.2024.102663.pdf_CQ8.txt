Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for fish biomass estimation, and it includes figures and references to other research papers, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
