Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and testing of the algorithms, including the implementation details of the AN algorithm in MATLAB and the classical machine-learning algorithms in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
