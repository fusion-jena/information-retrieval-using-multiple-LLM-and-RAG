Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses various aspects of deep learning model development, such as batch normalization, pre-training on ImageNet dataset, fine-tuning on Pl@ntNet data, and the importance of metadata for sharing AI-generated data. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
