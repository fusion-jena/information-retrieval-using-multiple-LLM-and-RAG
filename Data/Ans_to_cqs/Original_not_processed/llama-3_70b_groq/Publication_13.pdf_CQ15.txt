Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of CNN models, focal loss, and domain adversarial training, but it does not specify the optimization algorithms used to update the model parameters.

The context does mention the use of TensorFlow 2.5.0, which provides various optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adam, RMSProp, and others. However, it does not explicitly state which optimization algorithm was used in the specific deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
