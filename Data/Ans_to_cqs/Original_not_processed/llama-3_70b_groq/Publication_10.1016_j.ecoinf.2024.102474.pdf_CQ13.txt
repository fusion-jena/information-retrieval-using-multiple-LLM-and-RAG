Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, but it does not provide the actual values or settings used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
