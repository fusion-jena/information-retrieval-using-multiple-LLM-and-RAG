Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline is collected from expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas, specifically from the Western Australia (WA) subset of the Benthoz15 dataset. This dataset consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013).

It can be inferred that the method used for collecting raw data is through expert annotation of marine images, which suggests that human observers or experts in the field of marine biology or related fields are involved in collecting and annotating the data. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this specific context.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, which is a public dataset. But it is not clear if this dataset is used for collecting raw data or if it is used for pre-training the deep neural network.
