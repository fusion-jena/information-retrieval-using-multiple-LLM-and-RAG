Answer::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that some measures were taken to address this issue.

For instance, the context mentions that the authors "sought to explore different network sizes in conjunction with pre-training with additional acoustic reference data from outside of our audio domain, followed by fine-tuning with ROI data from our study site." This suggests that the authors attempted to increase the model's generalizability by pre-training on a broader dataset and fine-tuning on the specific ROI data from their study site.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors randomly sampled ROIs for the training, validation, and test sets, which could help reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. However, it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

It is also worth noting that the authors mention that using an out set of sample data from the same dataset as the training/validation data greatly overestimates performance of CNN models, which suggests that they were aware of the importance of using a diverse and representative dataset for evaluation.

Overall, while some measures were likely taken to ensure generalizability, the exact methods used are not clearly specified in the provided context.
