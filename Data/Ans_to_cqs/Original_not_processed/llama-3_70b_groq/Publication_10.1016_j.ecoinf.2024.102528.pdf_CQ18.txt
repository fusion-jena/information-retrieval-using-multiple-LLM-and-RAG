Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the monitoring framework for bird species identification using the BirdNET-Analyzer, including the preprocessing of acoustic signals, species identification, and filtering out false positives. It also discusses the performance of BirdNET-Analyzer on a dataset of 23 species, but it does not provide information on the training process or performance monitoring of the model.
