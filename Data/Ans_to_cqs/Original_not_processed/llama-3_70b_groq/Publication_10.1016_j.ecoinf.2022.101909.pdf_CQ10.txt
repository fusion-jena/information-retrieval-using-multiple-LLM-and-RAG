Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of ResNet50, a pre-trained model on ImageNet data, and the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. It also mentions other related research papers and datasets, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
