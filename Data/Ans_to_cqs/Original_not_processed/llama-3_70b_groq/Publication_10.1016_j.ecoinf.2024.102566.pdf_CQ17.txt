Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to forest biomass density, LiDAR data, and ecological informatics, which are unrelated to the query. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
