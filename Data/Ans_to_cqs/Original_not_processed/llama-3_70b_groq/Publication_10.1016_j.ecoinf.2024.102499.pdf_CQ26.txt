Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in marine ecology, specifically for shark identification and ecological studies. It discusses the architectures and parameters used in the models, such as NASnet and Faster-rcnn, and the evaluation metrics employed. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, including those used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this context.
