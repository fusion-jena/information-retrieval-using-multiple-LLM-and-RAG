Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, dataset preparation, and the iterative approach to extract weights assigned to the fully connected layers. It also discusses the improvement in prediction accuracy after introducing the hybrid model, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
