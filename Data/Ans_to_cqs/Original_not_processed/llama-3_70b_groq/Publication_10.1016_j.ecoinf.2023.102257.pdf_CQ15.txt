Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the application of machine learning models for image classification and object detection in the context of wildlife monitoring, but it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
