Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the figures provided (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored by tracking the training and validation accuracy during the training process. The figures show the training and validation accuracy curves for the transfer learned models and fine-tuned models, respectively. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using accuracy as a metric, and the performance was monitored by observing the changes in accuracy during training.
