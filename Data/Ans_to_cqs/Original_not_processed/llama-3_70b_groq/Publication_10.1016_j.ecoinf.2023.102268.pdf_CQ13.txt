Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context focuses on the application of the ResNet-50 model, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network, and its use in extracting features from spectrogram images. It also discusses the classification model, which is a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, and its training and validation process. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
