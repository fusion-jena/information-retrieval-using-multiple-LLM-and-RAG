Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the creation of training data, the extraction of results, and the conversion of sub-class land-cover maps to macro-class land-cover maps. It also mentions the use of a deep learning model for classification, but it does not provide information on how to determine when the training of the model is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
