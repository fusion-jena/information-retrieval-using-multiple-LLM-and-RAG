Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. It also mentions the importance of labeling data for training and validation. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
