Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery: Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) used UAS imagery for wetlands classification.
2. Airborne LiDAR data: Marasigan et al. (2019) used airborne LiDAR data for mangrove crown diameter measurement, and Yin and Wang (2019) used UAV-based LiDAR data for individual mangrove tree measurement.
3. LiDAR sensors mounted on UAVs: This study used a LiDAR sensor mounted on a UAV to collect high-density (HD) LiDAR data.
4. Ground-based LiDAR data: Jin et al. (2018) used ground-based LiDAR data to segment individual plants in maize plots, and Wang et al. (2019a) used ground-based light detection and ranging data for individual rubber tree segmentation.
5. High spatial resolution imagery: Xu et al. (2021) used high spatial resolution imagery for individual tree crown detection.

These methods are used to collect raw data, which is then used for various applications such as wetlands classification, mangrove tree measurement, and individual tree crown detection using deep learning techniques.
