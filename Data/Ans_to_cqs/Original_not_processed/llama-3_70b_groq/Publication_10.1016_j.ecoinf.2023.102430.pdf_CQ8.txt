Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various tools and platforms used, such as MATLAB, Python, and scikit-learn, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted. It also references various research papers and publications, but none of them seem to provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
