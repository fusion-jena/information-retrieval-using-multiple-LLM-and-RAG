Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the methodology for fuel model retrieval using a deep learning (DL) model, including the training of the model with synthetic data and its application to real MS point clouds. It also mentions the importance of efficiency in terms of time and tensor allocation memory for AI-based algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
