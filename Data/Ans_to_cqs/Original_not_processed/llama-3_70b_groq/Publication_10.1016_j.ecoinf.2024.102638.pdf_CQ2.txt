Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is CSV (Comma Separated Values). This inference is drawn from the presence of tables (Table 1 and Table 2) that describe the dataset features and instances before and after filtering, respectively. The tables suggest that the data is in a tabular format, which is commonly represented as CSV files. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
