Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights to automate image segmentation of fishes currently unrepresented within COCO out-of-the-box. This suggests that the model is leveraging knowledge learned from a large and diverse dataset (COCO) to perform well on novel input data.

Additionally, the context highlights the importance of model convergence, which is achieved through iterative minimization of the error between model output and expected output using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. This process helps the model generalize well to novel input data.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific measures were taken.
