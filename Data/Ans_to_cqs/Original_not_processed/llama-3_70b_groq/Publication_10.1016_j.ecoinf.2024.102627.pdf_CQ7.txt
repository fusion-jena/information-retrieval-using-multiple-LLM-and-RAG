Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text only mentions that the model is validated and calibrated on a validation set, but it does not provide details on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
