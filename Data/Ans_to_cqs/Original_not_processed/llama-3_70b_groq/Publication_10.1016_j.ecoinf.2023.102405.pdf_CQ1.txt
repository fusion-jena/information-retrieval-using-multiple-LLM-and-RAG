Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is IoT-based real-time data collection. This involves collecting data from IoT devices that measure various water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration. This real-time data is then used to calculate a water contamination index, which facilitates the accurate segregation of data into contaminated and non-contaminated classes.
