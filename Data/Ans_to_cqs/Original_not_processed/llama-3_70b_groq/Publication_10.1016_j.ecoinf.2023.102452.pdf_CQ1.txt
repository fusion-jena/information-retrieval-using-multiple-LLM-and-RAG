Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to various applications in water resources, ecology, and signal processing, it can be inferred that different methods might be used depending on the specific context.

For instance, in water resources applications, sensors might be used to collect data on streamflow, rainfall, or other hydrological variables. In ecological studies, surveys or field observations might be used to collect data on species populations, habitat characteristics, or other environmental factors. In signal processing applications, data might be collected from public datasets or generated synthetically.

Some references in the context mention the use of public datasets, such as the European Water Framework Directive, which might provide datasets for water resources applications. Additionally, the reference to Eureqa, a software tool for data-driven modeling, suggests that public datasets or user-provided data might be used as input for modeling and analysis.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
