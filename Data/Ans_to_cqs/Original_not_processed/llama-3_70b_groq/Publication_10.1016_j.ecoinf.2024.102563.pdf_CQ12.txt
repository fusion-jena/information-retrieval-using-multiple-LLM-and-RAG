Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in a pipeline, nor does it specify the type of deep learning model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, soil mapping, and image classification, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
