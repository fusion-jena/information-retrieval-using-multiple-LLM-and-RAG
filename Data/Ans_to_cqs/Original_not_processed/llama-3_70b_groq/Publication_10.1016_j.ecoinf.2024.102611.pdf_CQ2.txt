Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions the use of high-resolution images for classification tasks, image acquisition, and preprocessing techniques such as resizing, segmentation, and augmentation to increase the sample size. Additionally, the studies mentioned in the context focus on leaf-based plant species classification, disease detection in crops, and image classification tasks, which further suggest that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
