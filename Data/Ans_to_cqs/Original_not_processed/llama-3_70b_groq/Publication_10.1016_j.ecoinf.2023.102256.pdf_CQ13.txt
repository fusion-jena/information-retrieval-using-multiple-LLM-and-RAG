Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only describes the architecture of the baseline model, including the number of convolutional layers, filters, activation functions, and fully-connected layers. It also mentions the exploration of methods to incorporate additional information into the model, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
