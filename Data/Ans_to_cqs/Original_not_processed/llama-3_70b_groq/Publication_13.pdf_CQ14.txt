Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only discusses the training procedure of the model, which involves an adversarial training procedure to optimize the shared intermediate features to be invariant between the two domains. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
