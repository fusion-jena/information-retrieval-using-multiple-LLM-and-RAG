Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to various topics such as particle filters, Markov chain Monte Carlo, GPU programming, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. However, I can suggest that common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, batch normalization, and data augmentation, among others.
