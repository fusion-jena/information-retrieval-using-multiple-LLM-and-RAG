Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, using vessel tracking data, environmental data, and biodiversity data. It discusses data processing and integration, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
