Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to water resources, ecology, and signal processing, with references to papers on streamflow forecasting, rainfall-runoff modeling, and wavelet analysis. There is no mention of image datasets or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
