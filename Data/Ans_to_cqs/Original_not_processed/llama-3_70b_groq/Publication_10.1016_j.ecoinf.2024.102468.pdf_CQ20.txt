Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the WT-HMM model, its performance, and comparison with other models such as ANN, SVM, and SCD detectors, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
