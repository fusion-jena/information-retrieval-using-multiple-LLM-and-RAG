Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning rate, and loss function. It also describes the experimental design flow chart and the proposed MU-Net model structure. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
