Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the "diversity loss" in equation (2) as a regularization method used during pre-training. This suggests that diversity loss is used to regularize the model and prevent overfitting. 

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention other common regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these methods are used in the Wav2vec model.
