Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that an image set has been used in previous studies, including Lopez-Molina et al. (2015), Shokouh et al. (2021), and Wang et al. (2019). Additionally, it mentions that the third image set consists of ten images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora stained with SR2200 and available at https://github.com/hsueh-lab/FFT, plus five extra images.

It is also mentioned that Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of chromosomes.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are specific to the domain of biomedical images, including karyotyping images of chromosomes and images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora. However, the exact datasets are not explicitly mentioned.
