Answer: 

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Classification accuracy: This metric gives a ratio of the correct classifications and all classifications, describing the percentage of correct classifications.
2. Intersection over Union (IoU): Also referred to as Jaccard Index, this metric is used to overcome the issue of classification accuracy being less significant for unbalanced datasets.
3. Precision: This metric is used in the standard semantic segmentation analysis of the Johnsbachtal data subsets.
4. Recall: This metric is used in the standard semantic segmentation analysis of the Johnsbachtal data subsets.
5. F1-score: This metric is used in the standard semantic segmentation analysis of the Johnsbachtal data subsets, and is also mentioned separately as a metric.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context of semantic segmentation and image classification tasks.
