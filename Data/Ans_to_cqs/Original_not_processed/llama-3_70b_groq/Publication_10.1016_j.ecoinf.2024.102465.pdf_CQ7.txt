Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the models used, such as ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, HRNet, and XGBoost, and their applications in sentiment analysis, semantic segmentation, and audit opinion prediction. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, k-fold cross-validation, and time-series splitting. However, without specific information about the dataset and experiment design, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
