Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to discuss various methods and approaches for few-shot learning and bioacoustics, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. The mentioned archives, such as Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library, are digital bioacoustic archives, but they are not related to a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository.
