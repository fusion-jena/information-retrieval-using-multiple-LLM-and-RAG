Answer: 

The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this context are not explicitly stated as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the dataset was divided into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) subsets for model evaluation and hyperparameter search. This approach was chosen to obtain an unbiased estimation of error. Data augmentation was only applied to the training data to avoid overlapping the same data in different partitions.

Although cross-validation is mentioned in the context, it is stated that conducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often infeasible due to their high computational costs. Therefore, the strategy of separating data into training, validation, and testing was used to reduce over-training issues and evaluate the model's generalization in a specific domain when cross-validation is not feasible.

It is also mentioned that experimenting with different sites or spatially distinct areas in training, validation, and testing does not guarantee generalization to new sites, which may exhibit unique spatial variability and represent a different domain. This suggests that the generalizability of the model to new sites is a limitation of the approach used.
