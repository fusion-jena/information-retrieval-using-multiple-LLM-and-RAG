Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and mentions the use of the "mgcv" package in R, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. It is possible that the authors used a default set of hyperparameters or optimized them using a method not mentioned in the text. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization.
