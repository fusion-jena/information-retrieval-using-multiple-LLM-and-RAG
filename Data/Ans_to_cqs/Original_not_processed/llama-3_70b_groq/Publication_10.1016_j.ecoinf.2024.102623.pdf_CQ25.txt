Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is multi-label classification. This is inferred from the fact that the model uses a sigmoid function in the final layer to enable multi-label classification. Additionally, the context mentions Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which suggests that the model is predicting the presence or absence of multiple species at a given location. This is a classic multi-label classification problem, where the model is tasked with predicting multiple binary labels (species presence or absence) for each input sample.
