Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a research paper on machine learning models for predicting water quality parameters, and it discusses the hyperparameter tuning process and the performance of different machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
