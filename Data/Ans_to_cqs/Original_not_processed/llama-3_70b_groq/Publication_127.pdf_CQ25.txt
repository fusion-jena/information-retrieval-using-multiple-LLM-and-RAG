Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions that the final layer of a DNN is usually a softmax function, with an output between 0 and 1 per class and with all of the class outputs summing to 1. These outputs are often interpreted as the DNN's estimated probability of the image belonging in a certain class, and higher probabilities are often interpreted as the DNN being more confident that the image is of that class. This suggests that the model is designed to classify images into different categories. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used to better understand the complexities of natural ecosystems, which implies that the classification task is related to wildlife ecology, such as identifying species in camera-trap images.
