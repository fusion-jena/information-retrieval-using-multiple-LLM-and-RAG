Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. The video clips are transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second, and then annotated with bounding boxes to identify sharks and non-shark species. These images are then used to train and test the deep learning model. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
