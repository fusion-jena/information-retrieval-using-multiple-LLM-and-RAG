Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that many studies use data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data to address the issue of limited images, which can affect the performance of the DL models. 

It is mentioned that application of several image pre-processing techniques, such as resizing, removing background, image enhancement, and denoising, can also improve the performance of the models. But it does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this query based on the provided context.
