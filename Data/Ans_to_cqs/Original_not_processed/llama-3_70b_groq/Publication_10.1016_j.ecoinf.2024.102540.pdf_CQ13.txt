Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the number of epochs (400) and batch size (8) used for training the models. It does not provide information about other hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
