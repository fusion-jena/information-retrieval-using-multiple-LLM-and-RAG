Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the processes involved in doing so, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on the development and application of ecological niche models for marine species, citing various research papers and studies. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
