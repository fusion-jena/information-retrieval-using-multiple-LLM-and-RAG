Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only mentions the names of the models, such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster CNN, and ATSS, but does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement them. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning models.
