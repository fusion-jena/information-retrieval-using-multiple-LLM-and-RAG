Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the species assemblage predictor model, its architecture, and its theoretical guarantees, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the model is impacted by species detection bias, which means that some species might be observed more than others conditionally to a given x. This could lead to largely under-observed species being excluded from the predicted assemblage, and over-observed species being predicted at locations where they are not present. 

It is also mentioned that it would be interesting to study the impact of this type of bias on the assemblage-level indicators introduced in this work. This suggests that addressing data bias is an important consideration, but the context does not provide specific techniques used to address it.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
