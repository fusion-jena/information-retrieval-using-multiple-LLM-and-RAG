Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN, will be used in future LULC analysis, but it does not provide details on the model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
