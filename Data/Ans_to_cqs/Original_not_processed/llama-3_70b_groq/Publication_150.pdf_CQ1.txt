Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on different deep learning models, their architectures, and training parameters, but it does not discuss data collection methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database. This suggests that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline might be image data, but the method of collecting this data is not specified.

In general, raw data for deep learning pipelines can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, web scraping, and more, depending on the specific application and problem domain. But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact method used in this particular context.
