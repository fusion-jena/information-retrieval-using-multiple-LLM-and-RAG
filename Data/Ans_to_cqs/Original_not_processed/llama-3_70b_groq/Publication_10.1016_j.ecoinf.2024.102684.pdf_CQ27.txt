Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the methodology used to train and evaluate the models, including the use of Keras library in Python, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. It does not mention model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
