Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their applications in Big Data analysis, biosecurity, and machine hearing for marine species identification. It also mentions autoencoders and the GRELMA algorithm, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
