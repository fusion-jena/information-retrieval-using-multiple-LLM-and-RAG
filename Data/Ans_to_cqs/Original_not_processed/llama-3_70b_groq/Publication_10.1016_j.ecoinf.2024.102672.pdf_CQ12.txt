Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This suggests that the model might be a type of feedforward neural network, but it is not clear if it is a specific type like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
