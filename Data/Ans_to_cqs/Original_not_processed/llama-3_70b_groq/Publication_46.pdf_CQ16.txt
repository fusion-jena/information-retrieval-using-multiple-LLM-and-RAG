Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on model validation and comparison using metrics like AUC, TSS, and kappa coefficient, as well as explaining the functionality of pooling layers and the SoftMax function in CNN-based models. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
