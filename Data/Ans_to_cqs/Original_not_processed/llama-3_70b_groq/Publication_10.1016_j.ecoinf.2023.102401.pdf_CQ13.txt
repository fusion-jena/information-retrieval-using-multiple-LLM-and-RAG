Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context discusses the architecture of the SRC3 block, performance evaluation metrics, and datasets used, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
