Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the prediction of aphid population dynamics using a pattern-based prediction (PBP) method. It discusses the selection of parameters, such as x*, m, d*, and Î±, and the use of k-fold cross-validation to optimize the accuracy of the method. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
