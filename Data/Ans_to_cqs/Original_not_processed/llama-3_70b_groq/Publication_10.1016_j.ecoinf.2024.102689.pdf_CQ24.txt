Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on applications of deep learning in fish recognition, aquaculture, and marine ecological protection, as well as various techniques for model compression, pruning, and optimization. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
