Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the importance of dataset size, annotation process, and image augmentation, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

The context does mention the use of validation images (141 images) and provides benchmark results in terms of average precision and average recall, but it does not specify how these metrics are used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
