Answer: 

According to the provided context, the training is considered complete when the training loss converges. This is mentioned in the section 3.1, where it is stated that "After 65 K iterations, the training loss converges, and the training process takes approximately 11.5 h." 

There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria being used to determine when training is complete. It seems that the training is stopped when the training loss stops improving or converges.
