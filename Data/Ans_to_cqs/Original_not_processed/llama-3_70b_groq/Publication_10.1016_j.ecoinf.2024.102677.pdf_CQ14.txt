Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively." However, it does not specify the method used for parameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
