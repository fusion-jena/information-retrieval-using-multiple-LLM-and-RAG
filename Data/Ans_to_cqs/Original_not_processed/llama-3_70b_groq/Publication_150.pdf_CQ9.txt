Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing various deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on a specific task. The context provides information about the models, their parameters, and their accuracy, but it does not mention where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
