Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions a dataset, but it does not provide a link to a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The closest mention is a link to a Kaggle dataset called "Cactus Aerial Photos" (https://www.kaggle.com/), but it is not clear if this is the exact dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. Without further information, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository.
