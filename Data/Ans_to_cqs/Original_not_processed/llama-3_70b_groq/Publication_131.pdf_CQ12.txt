Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the context, specifically in Section 2.2, "CNN Classification System", where the design of the CNN classification system is described. The structure of the CNN is also shown in Figure 11, which details the architecture of the network, including the number of filters, kernel size, and fully connected layers.
