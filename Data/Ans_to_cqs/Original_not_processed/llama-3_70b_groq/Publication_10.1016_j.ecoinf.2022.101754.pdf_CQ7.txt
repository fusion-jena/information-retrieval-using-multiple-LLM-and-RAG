Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study used stratification splitting to split the data into training and test sets. However, there is no explicit mention of the criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training, specifically for train, test, and validation sets.

The context only mentions that the study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, and 100 different splits to the training-and-test set were given. It does not provide further details on the criteria used for splitting the data.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
