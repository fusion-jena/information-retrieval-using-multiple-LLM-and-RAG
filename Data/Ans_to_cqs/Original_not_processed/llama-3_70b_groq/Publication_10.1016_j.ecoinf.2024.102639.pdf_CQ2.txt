Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies in animal behavior studies, but it does not provide specific information about the data formats used.

The context mentions various applications of machine learning and deep learning, such as image processing, neuroscience, and genomics, which may involve different data formats. However, it does not specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for animal behavior studies.

The figures provided, such as Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, and Fig. 14, appear to be confusion matrices for different machine learning models, but they do not provide information about the data formats used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
