Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the performance of different deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) in forecasting algal blooms using satellite data, and it discusses the advantages of hybrid models and the importance of satellite data in ocean monitoring. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the models.
