Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the implementation of a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species based on digitally available occurrence records. It discusses the features used, the training and testing process, and the results obtained. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question.
