Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a machine learning model for classifying fishing activity cells, but it does not provide information about the platform used to deploy the model. The context discusses the use of the GRSF semantic knowledge base and the SPARQL endpoint, but it does not mention any cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
