Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the evaluation index, knowledge distillation methods, and the performance of the refined model compared to YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used.
