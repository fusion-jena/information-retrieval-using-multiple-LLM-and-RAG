Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the results of experiments with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters for species classification. The text mentions various references to other papers and architectures, but it does not provide information about the code repository or where the code can be found. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository.
