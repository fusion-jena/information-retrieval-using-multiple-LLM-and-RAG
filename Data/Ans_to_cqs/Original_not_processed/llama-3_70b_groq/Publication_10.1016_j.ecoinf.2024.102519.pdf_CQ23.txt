Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses the process of identifying an Ecological Source Area (ESA) using a multicondition optimization problem, genetic optimization algorithms, and programming in Python. It also mentions the use of artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide susceptibility prediction, but it does not provide information on how the generalizability of these models was ensured. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
