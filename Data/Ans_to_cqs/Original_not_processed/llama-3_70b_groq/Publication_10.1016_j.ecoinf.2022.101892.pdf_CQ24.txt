Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some techniques that can help reduce the impact of randomness, such as data augmentation and five-fold subject-exclusive cross-validation.

Data augmentation, which involves applying random transformations to the training data, can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model to random variations in the data. This can be seen in the context where it is mentioned that "to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation."

The five-fold subject-exclusive cross-validation technique ensures that the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets, which can help reduce the impact of individual variations and randomness in the data.

However, there is no mention of setting a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
