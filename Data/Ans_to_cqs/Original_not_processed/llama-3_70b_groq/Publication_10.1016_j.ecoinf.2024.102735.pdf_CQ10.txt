Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The references provided are academic papers and do not include links to code repositories. The acknowledgement section mentions the Clemson Computing and Information Technology (CCIT) and the Cyberinfrastructure Technology Integration (CITI) group, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
