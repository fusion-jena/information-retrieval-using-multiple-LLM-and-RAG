Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on habitat distribution and climate change, using an ensemble modeling approach with four different models (MaxEnt, RF, SVM, and a regression-based model) in the BIOMOD2 package in R. The input data for these models consists of various environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and distance to roads and rivers, but there is no mention of deep learning or specific data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV.
