Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network in MATLAB R2014b for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSI) from input variables aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). It also mentions the use of the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. However, it does not specify the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

The LASSO model is used to investigate the multicollinearity between variables and to perform variable selection by shrinking less important variables' coefficients to zero. This is a form of regularization, but it is not specifically mentioned as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
