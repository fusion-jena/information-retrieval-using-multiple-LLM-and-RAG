Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecology, and conservation biology, with mentions of model accuracy, climate change, and species occurrence databases. There is no mention of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
