Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be discussing a hybrid MCMC algorithm, genetic algorithm, and least squares fitting, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
