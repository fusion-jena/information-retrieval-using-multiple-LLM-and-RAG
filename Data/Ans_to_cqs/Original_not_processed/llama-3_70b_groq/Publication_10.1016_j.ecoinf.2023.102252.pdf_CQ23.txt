Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, FERM, which is used to improve wetland ecosystem services and biodiversity. The equations and variables mentioned in the context are related to ecological targets, wet spell durations, and condition scores, but do not involve deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
