Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Maxent models for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease, and the development of an ensemble model by integrating these two models. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.
