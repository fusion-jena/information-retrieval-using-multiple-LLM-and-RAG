Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context mentions Xeno-canto, a public online database of bird sounds, and eBird, a citizen science platform for bird observations, but it does not provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the context does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, which are data repositories commonly used for sharing research data. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
