Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to data sources, preprocessing, and clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
