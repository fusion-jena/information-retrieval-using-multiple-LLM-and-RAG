Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning techniques, architectures, and algorithms, such as Res2Net, Deep SORT, Mask R-CNN, and MSNet, as well as their applications in computer vision tasks like object detection and feature extraction. 

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or cameras, as mentioned in the context of estimating the population size of migrating Tibetan antelopes using UAVs. Additionally, the context mentions images and faces, implying that visual data might be collected through cameras or other imaging devices. 

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context cites various research papers and conferences, which often rely on publicly available datasets. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
