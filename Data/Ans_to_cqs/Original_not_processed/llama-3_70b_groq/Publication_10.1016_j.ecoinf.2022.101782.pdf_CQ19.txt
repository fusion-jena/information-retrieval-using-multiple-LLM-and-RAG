Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Google Colab Pro infrastructure, which supports Jupyter notebooks and provides a GPU-enabled runtime environment for model training. However, it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework is used to build the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
