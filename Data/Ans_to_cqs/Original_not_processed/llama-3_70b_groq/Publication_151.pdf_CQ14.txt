Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameters were based on preselected values that were not fine-tuned on any dataset due to computational reasons. However, it suggests that in practice, it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set. This implies that the authors did not perform any optimization of hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search, in their experiments. Instead, they used default values for the hyperparameters.
