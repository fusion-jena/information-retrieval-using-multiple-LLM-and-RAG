Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the encoder and decoder, as well as the pre-processing and post-processing blocks. It also references various academic papers and studies, but these references do not provide information on data collection methods.

The only mention of data collection is a passing reference to "acoustic surveys" in the context, but it does not elaborate on the methods used for collecting the raw data. Additionally, there is a mention of a "data repository" in appendix B, but it is not clear what type of data is stored in the repository or how it was collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
