Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling and MaxEnt, which is a machine learning algorithm used for species distribution modeling, but not deep learning. The optimization techniques mentioned in the context are related to model selection and hyperparameter tuning, such as the use of the Akaike minimum information criterion (AICc) and permutation importance, but not optimization techniques specific to deep learning.
