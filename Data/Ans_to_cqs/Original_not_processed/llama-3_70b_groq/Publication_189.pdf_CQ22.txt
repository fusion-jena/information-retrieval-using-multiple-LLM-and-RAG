Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context provides the loss values for training and validation datasets during Mask R-CNN training, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model is being trained for object detection and segmentation tasks, and the loss values provided are related to the losses for the classifier, bounding box regression, and mask prediction. 

Typically, in object detection and segmentation tasks, metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, these metrics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
