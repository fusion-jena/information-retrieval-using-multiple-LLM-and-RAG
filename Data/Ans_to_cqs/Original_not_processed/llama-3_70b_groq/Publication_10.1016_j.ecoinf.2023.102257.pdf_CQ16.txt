Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the experiment's objectives, materials, and methods, as well as the results of the experiment, including the classification outcomes and performance metrics of the ML bounding box model. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
