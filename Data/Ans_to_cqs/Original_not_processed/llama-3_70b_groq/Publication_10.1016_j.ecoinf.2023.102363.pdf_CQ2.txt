Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a novel spectrogram representation, which is transformed from raw audio data. This is mentioned in the context as "Audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation (White et al., 2022)". This suggests that the model is using a spectrogram representation of audio data as input, rather than image, video, or CSV formats.
