Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does provide some information about the deep learning models used in the studies.

In the context provided, the deep learning models used NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2. The models were trained on resized images with a specific learning rate and batch size, and the training was completed using a GPU-cluster.

While the context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness, it can be inferred that the use of a specific architecture, learning rate, and batch size might help in reducing the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the use of a GPU-cluster for training might also help in reducing the variability in the results.

However, without explicit information, it is difficult to say what specific strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the exact answer to this query based on the provided context.
