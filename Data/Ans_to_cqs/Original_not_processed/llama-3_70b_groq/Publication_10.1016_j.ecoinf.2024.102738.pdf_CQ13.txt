Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to land use/land cover (LULC) classification, remote sensing, and random forest classification, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
