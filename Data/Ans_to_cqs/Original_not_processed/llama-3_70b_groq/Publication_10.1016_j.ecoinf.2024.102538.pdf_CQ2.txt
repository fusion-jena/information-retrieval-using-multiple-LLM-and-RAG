Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on bird sound recognition. The data format used in this pipeline is likely to be audio data, specifically mel-scale spectrograms. This is inferred from the text, which mentions "mapping the sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram" as part of the mainstream deep learning approach for sound recognition. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
