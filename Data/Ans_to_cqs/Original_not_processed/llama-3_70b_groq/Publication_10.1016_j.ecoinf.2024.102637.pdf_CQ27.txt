Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the design and optimization of the lightweight SIAlex model, its application in bird voice recognition, and the importance of deep learning in conservation efforts. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
