Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses surrogate models, their development, and their applications, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. 

The context mentions that the surrogate model's parameters need to be optimized to balance variance and bias, but it does not specify the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
