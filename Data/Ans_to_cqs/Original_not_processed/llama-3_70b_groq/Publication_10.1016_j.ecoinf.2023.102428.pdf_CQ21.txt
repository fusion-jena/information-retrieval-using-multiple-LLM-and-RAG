Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and model description, specifically the MLPnn-MC modelling. It provides details about the model's parameters and performance, but it does not elaborate on the postprocessing steps.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Training RMS, Testing RMS, and Accuracy Rate, which are mentioned in Table 7. Additionally, the context mentions the "valuation of C sequestration" as one of the stages of the research workflow, but it does not provide further details on how this valuation is done.

In the absence of explicit information, it cannot be determined what specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, are involved after the model training.
