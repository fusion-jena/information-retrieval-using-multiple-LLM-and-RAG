Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, drought characteristics, and climate hotspots in the GAB region. It also provides equations for calculating drought indices and lists various datasets used in the study. However, it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
