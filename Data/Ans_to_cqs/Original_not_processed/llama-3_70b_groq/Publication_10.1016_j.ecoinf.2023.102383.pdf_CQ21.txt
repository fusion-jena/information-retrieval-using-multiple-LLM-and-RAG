Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, specifically the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the residual neural networks (ResNets), as well as the hard negative mining technique used during training. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained, such as the calculation of metrics, generation of saliency maps, or creation of a confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
