Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context focuses on the computational cost and parameters of a single layer, the model's speed, and the comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art deep learning models. It also provides information about the structure of MobileNetV2 and the WildARe-YOLO model, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
