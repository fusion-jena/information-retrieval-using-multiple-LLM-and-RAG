Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the evaluation of different machine learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters, including the use of hyperparameter optimization methods like random grid search and Bayesian optimization. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.
