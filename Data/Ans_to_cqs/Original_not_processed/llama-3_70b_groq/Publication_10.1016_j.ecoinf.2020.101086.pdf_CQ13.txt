Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models, correction methods, and parameterization, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
