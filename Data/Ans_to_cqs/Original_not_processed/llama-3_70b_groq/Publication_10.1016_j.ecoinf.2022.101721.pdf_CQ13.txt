Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing statistical modeling, machine learning, and Bayesian algorithms in the context of species identification, particularly for bats. It does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
