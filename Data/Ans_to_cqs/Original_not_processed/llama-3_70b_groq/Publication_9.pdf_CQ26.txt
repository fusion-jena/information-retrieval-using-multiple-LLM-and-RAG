Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning algorithms, in ecology and evolutionary biology. It discusses the utility of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their limitations when dealing with novel input data that is distant from the original training data.

However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to mitigate data bias and ensure that the model is trained on a representative dataset, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
