Answer:::
Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors used data augmentation with the fastai get_transforms function. Specifically, they allowed for vertical flipping of images by setting "flip_vert = TRUE", limited overly exposing the images by setting "max_lighting = 0.02", disabled the zooming augmentation by setting "max_zoom = 1", and reduced the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU) by setting "to_fp16 = TRUE". This helped to increase the diversity of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context.
