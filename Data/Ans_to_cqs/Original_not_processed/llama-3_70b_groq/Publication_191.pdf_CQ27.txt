Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the importance of deep learning in plant species identification, the limitations of existing plant datasets, and the optimization capabilities of deep CNN networks. It also discusses the performance of various classifiers and features on plant identification tasks. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
