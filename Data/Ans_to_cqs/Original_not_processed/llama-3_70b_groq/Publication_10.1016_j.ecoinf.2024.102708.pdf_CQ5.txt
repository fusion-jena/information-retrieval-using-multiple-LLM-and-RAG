Answer::: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are VisDrone and COCO. The TPH-YOLOv5 model was pre-trained with the VisDrone dataset, while the YOLOv5m, YOLOv5s, and FR-CNN models were pre-trained on the COCO dataset. These datasets were used to leverage the advantages of transfer learning. There is no mention of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the provided context.
