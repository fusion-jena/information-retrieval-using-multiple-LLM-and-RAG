Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Initial learning rate: 10^(-8)
* Optimizer: Stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum of 0.9
* Batch-size: 50 (batch samples are randomly chosen at each iteration)

These hyperparameters were used to fit the SNN, DNN, and CNN models with the package mxnet. The choice of initial learning rate was critical for a good optimization behavior, as a too big learning rate can lead to training loss divergence, whereas when it is too small, learning can be very slow.
