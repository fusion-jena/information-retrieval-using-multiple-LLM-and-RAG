Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the LaDeco module, its default model (deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269), and its functionality, such as loading pre-trained models, setting thresholds, and output formats. It also provides a list of references related to semantic segmentation, machine learning, and computer vision. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
