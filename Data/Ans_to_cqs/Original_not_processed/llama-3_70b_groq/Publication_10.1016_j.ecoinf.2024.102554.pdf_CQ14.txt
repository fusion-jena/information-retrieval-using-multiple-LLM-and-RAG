Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters of a model, nor does it discuss grid search, random search, or any other method of hyperparameter optimization. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and data collection from satellite images, but it does not provide information about machine learning model optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
