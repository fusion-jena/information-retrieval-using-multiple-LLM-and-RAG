Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of XGBoost, which is an extreme gradient boosting model, but it is not a deep learning model. It also mentions the use of a hybrid model for predicting forest fires vulnerability with a deep learning model-based approach for forests classification, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
