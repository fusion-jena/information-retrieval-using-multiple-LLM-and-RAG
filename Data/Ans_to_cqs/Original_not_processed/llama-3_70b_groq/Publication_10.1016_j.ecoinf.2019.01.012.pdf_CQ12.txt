Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text, which mentions "we trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected layer" and "Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to extract spatial features."
