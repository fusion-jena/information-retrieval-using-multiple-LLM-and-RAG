Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to discuss the application of AI classification to biodiversity observations, the importance of defining a threshold for filtering data, and the potential for generalizing the approach to larger geographical scales and other social networks.

The context does mention "network training" in one of the references, but it does not provide further information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
