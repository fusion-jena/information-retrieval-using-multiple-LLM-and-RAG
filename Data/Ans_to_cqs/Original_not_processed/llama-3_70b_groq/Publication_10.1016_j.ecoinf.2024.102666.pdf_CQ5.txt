Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and aquatic environments, discussing satellite images, sensors, and atmospheric correction algorithms. It mentions specific datasets or images, such as HY-1C CZI, Sentinel-2, and ALOS AVNIR-2, but these are not typical deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
