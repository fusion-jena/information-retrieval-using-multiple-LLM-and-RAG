Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a research article discussing ensemble habitat selection modeling and background sampling, but it does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
