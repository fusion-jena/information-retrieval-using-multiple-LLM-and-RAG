Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, hyperparameters, learning rates, or optimizers. The text appears to discuss data repositories, citation challenges, and solutions for citing large collections of data packages. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, and therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
