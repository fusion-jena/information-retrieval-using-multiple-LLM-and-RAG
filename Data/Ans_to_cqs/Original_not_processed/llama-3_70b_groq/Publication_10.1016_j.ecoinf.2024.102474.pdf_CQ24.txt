Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the authors "resorted to purely deterministic variants of these architectures," suggesting that they may have taken steps to minimize or eliminate randomness in their models. 

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on how randomness was handled. It does mention the use of PyTorch Lightning and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not elaborate on how these tools handle randomness.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
