Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the evaluation of a classifier, including the calculation of accuracy and F-measure, as well as the learning rate and batch size used during training. However, it does not provide information on when to stop training.

Typically, training is considered complete when a certain condition is met, such as a plateau in validation loss, a maximum number of epochs, or a desired level of accuracy. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
