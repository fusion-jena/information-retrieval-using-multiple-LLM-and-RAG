Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information, but it does not delve into the details of regularization techniques.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net models, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods employed to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
