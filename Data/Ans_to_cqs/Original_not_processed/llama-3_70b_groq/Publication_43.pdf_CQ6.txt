Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique to overcome the limitation of a small labeled training set. Data augmentation is a preprocessing technique that involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing images, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a threshold based on high albedo (light color) to eliminate the background, which could be considered as a preprocessing step. However, it is not clear if this step is applied before training the model or as part of the detection-proposal pre-processing technique.

In general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves resizing the input images to a fixed size, and cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the data. However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, it does mention data augmentation and background elimination as techniques used in the experiment.
