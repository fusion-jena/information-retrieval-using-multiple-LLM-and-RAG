Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and feature extraction techniques in deep learning models. It discusses the use of convolutional kernels, bottleneck blocks, and attention modules like CBAM, CA, and SE to improve model performance. However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
