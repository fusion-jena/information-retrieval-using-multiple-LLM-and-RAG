Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, and mean F1-score. These metrics are reported in Table 3 for both the CNN and XGB models on two independent validation data sets (ABMI plots and CCMEO). Additionally, per-class F1-scores are also reported in Figure 3 for both models on the ABMI and CCMEO data. 

However, it's worth noting that other metrics such as user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) are also reported in the confusion matrices (Tables A3 and A4) for the CNN and XGB models, respectively. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance on a class-by-class basis.
