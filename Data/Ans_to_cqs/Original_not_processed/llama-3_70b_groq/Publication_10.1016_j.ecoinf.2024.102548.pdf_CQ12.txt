Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the mention of specific CNN architectures such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNet, and VGG-19. These models are all variants of CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
