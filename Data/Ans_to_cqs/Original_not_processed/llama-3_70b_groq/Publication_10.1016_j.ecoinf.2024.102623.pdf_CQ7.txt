Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on spatial block cross-validation. The region of interest is divided into 5 Ã— 5 geospatial blocks, and these blocks are assigned to k distinct folds. In this case, k = 5, resulting in each fold containing approximately the same number of presence observations. The model is trained on 80% of the presences (4 folds) and validated on the remaining 20% (1 fold). This process is repeated for each of the 5 folds, and the results are averaged. This approach is used to alleviate the issue of biased model selection when working with presence-only data.
