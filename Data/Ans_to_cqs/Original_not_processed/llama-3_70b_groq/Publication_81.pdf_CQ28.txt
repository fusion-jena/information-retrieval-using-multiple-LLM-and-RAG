Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning methods in biological networks, the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for fish classification, and references various research papers and tools such as MEGA X and BMC Genet. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model.
