Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on acoustic surveys, marine mammal classification, and deep learning-based acoustic data analysis, but it does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of a model. These metrics can provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify or predict outcomes.

If more context or information about the specific deep learning model and its application were provided, it might be possible to infer or suggest relevant evaluation metrics. However, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
