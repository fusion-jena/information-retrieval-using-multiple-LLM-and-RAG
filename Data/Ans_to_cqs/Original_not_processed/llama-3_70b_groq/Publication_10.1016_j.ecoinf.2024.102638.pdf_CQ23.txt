Answer:::

The context does not specifically mention a deep learning model. However, it does describe the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models in general.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the dataset was divided into training sets (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data) using random sampling. This was done to minimize the risk of bias and preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets.

Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation was used during the hyperparameter optimization process to fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model within the confines of the training set. This helps to enhance the predictive performance of the models and ensures that the models are not overfitting to the training data.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
