Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, vegetation indices, and crop classification, with references to various studies and methodologies. It does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps required for training a deep learning model.

However, in general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling numerical values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.

Since the provided context does not provide specific information on these preprocessing steps, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
