Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images. The study uses these images to detect and map burned areas within the Cerrado biome in Brazil. The images consist of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. The context does not mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
