Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the performance of different modeling approaches, including Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and how they are affected by the number of background points used in training. It also mentions the use of internal cross-validation during model training, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
