Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of linear discriminant analysis for species and sex discrimination. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does mention some measures that were taken to ensure the robustness of the discriminant analysis model. For example, a predictor screening analysis was used to identify the most important variables for discrimination, and a stepwise variable selection procedure was used to select the variables with the best discriminating power. Additionally, the context mentions the use of bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object.

It is also worth noting that the dataset was split into training, validation, and test groups, which is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. However, the context does not provide further details on how the data was split or if any cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were used.
