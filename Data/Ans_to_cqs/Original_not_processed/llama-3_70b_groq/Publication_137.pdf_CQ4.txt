Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the SPG framework, point cloud partition, and segmentation using PointNet and GRU, as well as the experimental results and discussion. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
