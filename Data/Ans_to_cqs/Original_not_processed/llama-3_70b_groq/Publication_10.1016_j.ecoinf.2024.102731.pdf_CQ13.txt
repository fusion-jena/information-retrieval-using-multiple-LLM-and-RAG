Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be a collection of references to academic papers and a table describing land cover classes, along with a scoring scale for permeability. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
