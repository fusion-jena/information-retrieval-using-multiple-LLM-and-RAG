Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data in the study. It can be inferred that these data are likely collected through remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aerial imagery, and LiDAR sensors. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of field work in measuring tree samples well, which suggests that some form of ground truth data collection may be involved. However, the specific methods of data collection are not detailed in the provided context.
