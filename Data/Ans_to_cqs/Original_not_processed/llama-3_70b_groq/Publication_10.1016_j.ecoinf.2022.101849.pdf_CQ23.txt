Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. The context appears to focus on a regression task with structurally incomplete target labels and discusses various approaches to handle this type of data, including baseline approaches and a partial imputation algorithm. It also mentions a case study in predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
