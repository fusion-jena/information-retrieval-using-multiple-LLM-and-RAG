Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically using Maxent, and discusses parameters used in Maxent such as regularization multiplier, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
