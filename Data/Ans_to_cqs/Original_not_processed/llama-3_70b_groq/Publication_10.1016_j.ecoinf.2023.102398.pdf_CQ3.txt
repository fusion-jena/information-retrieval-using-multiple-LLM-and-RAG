Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
