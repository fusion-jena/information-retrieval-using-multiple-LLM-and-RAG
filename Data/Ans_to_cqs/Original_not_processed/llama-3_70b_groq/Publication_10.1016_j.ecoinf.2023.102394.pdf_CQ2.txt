Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The references cited are related to soil organic carbon mapping, ecological informatics, and machine learning, but they do not specify the data formats used. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats might be related to spatial or environmental data, such as raster or vector data, or CSV files containing climate, soil, or vegetation data. But without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
