Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It discusses various components of the model, such as convolutional blocks, attention layers, and activation functions, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the model was built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework.
