Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "online regularized classification algorithms" in the paper by Ying and Zhou (2006). This suggests that regularization methods are used in online learning settings, but it does not specify which methods are used.

The context also discusses deep learning in general, citing the paper by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015), but it does not provide information on specific regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to list the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
