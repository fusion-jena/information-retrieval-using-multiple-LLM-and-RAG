Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the custom D-CNN model named CoralNet and its training parameters, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
