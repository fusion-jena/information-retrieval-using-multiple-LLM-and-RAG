Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that "All images were resized to 224 x 224 pixels previous to training and image augmentation (shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears) was applied to expand the training data set." 

However, there is no explicit mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It can be inferred that resizing and image augmentation were performed, but the context does not provide information about other preprocessing steps. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps were involved in the preprocessing of the images before training the deep learning model.
