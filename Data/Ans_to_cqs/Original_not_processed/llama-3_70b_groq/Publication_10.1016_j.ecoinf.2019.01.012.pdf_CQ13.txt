Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Activation functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for the convolutional layers and ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) for the fully connected layer.
* Optimizer: Adaptive ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
* Batch size: 256.
* Number of iterations: 16,290, which is equivalent to 90 epochs.

These hyperparameters were chosen to optimize the model's performance on the classification task. The use of ReLU and ELU activation functions, along with the Adaptive ADAM optimizer, is a common combination in deep learning models. The learning rate, batch size, and number of iterations were likely chosen through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best results on the validation set.
