Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are optimized. The text explains how XGBoost works, including its ensemble model structure and the use of regression decision trees, but it does not discuss hyperparameter optimization. 

It is common to use techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to optimize hyperparameters, but without further information, it is impossible to determine which method was used in this specific case.
