Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on land use/cover change analysis, mangrove forest studies, and remote sensing applications. It discusses the use of Google Earth Pro, random forest algorithm, and post-classification processing, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of very-high-resolution satellite imagery in one of the cited studies (Lassalle et al., 2022), which might require preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before being used as input to a deep learning model. Nevertheless, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to answer the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
