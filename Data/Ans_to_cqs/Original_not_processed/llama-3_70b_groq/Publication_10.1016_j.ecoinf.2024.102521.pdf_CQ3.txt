Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "box annotations" in the context of downloading images and their annotations as Comma Separated Values (csv) files. This suggests that bounding box annotation might be one of the techniques used. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques.
