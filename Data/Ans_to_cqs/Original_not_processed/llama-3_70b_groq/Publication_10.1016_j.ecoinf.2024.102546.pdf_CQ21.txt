Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the dataset curation, model hyperparameters, and training settings. It does not provide information on what happens after the model training, such as the calculation of metrics, generation of saliency maps, or creation of a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
