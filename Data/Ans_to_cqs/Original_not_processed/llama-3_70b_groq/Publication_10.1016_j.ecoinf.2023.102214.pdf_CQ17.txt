Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that "left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques" were used to reduce the issue of overfitting and strengthen the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. This suggests that data augmentation was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. No other regularization methods are mentioned in the provided context.
