Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. 

The optimization technique mentioned is Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV), which is used for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
