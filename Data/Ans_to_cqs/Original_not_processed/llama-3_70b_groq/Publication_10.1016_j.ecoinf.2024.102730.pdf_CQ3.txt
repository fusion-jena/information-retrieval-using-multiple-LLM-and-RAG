Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning in vegetation studies, including plant species identification, vegetation monitoring, and phenology. It mentions various machine learning models and techniques, such as support vector machines, boosted tree ensembles, artificial neural networks, and convolutional networks, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
