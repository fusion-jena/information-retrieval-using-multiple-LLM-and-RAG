Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This is a preprocessing step, not a data augmentation technique. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
