Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of different pre-trained networks, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and their application in image analysis. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
