Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used to classify fire-damaged monuments and identify minor fires. This is mentioned in the sentence: "Machine learning techniques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable success in identifying minor fires." 

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for land use and land cover classification, as seen in the study by Prasai et al. (2021) that applied the Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification in Florida, USA. 

However, it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models for segmentation or detection.
