Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep learning, including sentiment analysis, urban built environment analysis, and image feature extraction. It discusses the use of different models, such as ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and Hrnet, but does not provide information on handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
