Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors took measures to ensure the generalizability of their model by creating a representative dataset. The text states that "the overall proportion of the complete dataset can be described as representative of land use classes in the study area." This suggests that the authors aimed to create a dataset that is diverse and representative of the different land use classes in the study area.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model. It is possible that these measures were taken, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the authors took measures to create a representative dataset, but the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, are not mentioned.
