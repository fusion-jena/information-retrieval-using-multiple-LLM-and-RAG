Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that data from sources such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). But, it does not specify if the deep learning pipeline's data repository is available on GBIF or any other platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this question based on the provided context.
