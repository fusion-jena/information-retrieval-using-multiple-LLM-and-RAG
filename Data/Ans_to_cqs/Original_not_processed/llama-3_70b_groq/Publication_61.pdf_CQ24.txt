Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a variant of stochastic gradient optimization that adjusts the learning rate automatically. This could help mitigate the effects of randomness in the learning process.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a batch size of 2500, which could help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process by averaging out the gradients over a larger number of samples.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any explicit strategies for setting or controlling random seed values, which are often used to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the question, it suggests that the use of the Adam optimizer and a large batch size may help mitigate the effects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide information on strategies for handling randomness through random seed values or other means.
