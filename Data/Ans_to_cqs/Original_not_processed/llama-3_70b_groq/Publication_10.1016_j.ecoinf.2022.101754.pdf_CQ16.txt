Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that "Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set" and that "This was followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter." However, it does not provide information on how the optimal hyperparameter setting was determined or when the training was considered complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
