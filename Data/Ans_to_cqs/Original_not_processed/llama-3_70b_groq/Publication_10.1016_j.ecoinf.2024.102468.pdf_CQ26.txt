Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the performance of WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes, data denoising, and data annotations in the context of whale sound recordings. It does not discuss data bias or techniques to address it.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in relation to addressing data bias.
