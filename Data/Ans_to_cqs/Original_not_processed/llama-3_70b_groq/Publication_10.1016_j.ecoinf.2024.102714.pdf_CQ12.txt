Answer: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not a deep learning model at all. According to the provided context, the model used is an XGBoostClassifier, which is a type of gradient boosting model, not a deep learning model. XGBoost is a popular and widely-used machine learning algorithm, but it is not a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
