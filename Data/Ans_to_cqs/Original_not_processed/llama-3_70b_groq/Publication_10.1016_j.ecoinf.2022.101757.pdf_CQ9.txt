Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of the COCO dataset, which is a widely used dataset for training computer vision models, and provides a link to a GitHub repository (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) that contains an implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. However, it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
