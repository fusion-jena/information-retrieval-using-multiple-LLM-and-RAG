Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the methodology, dataset, and results of the study, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training and testing the auto-encoder model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
