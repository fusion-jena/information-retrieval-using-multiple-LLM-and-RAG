Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a research paper about fire risk mapping in the MuÄŸla region of Turkey, using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. The context provides information about the study area, climate, and vegetation, as well as the methodology used for fire risk mapping. However, it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
