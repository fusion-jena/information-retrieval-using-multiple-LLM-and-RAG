Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "in the proposed model, the training data is separated into training and validation groups" to track the generalisation performance. This implies that the data is split into at least two groups: training and validation. 

It is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three groups: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and track the generalisation performance, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. 

However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., ratio of data in each group, stratification, etc.) are not mentioned in the provided context.
