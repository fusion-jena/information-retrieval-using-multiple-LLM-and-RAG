Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the maximum training times are set to 10,000 and the training error is set to 0.001. This suggests that the training is complete when the training error reaches 0.001 or the maximum number of training times (10,000) is reached, whichever comes first.
