Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for species distribution modeling, including the use of residual connections, batch normalization, and the AdamW optimizer. It also discusses the advantages of deep learning methods in ecological research and their performance on various datasets. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks.
