Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. These metrics are computed for the final selected 21 pixels, as shown in Fig. 4. The accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model, precision measures the number of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive, recall measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The confusion matrix provides a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance by showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
