Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method and its application to classify animal species based on footprints. It discusses the use of imperfect footprints, missing value imputation, and the potential of utilizing lower-quality data effectively. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
