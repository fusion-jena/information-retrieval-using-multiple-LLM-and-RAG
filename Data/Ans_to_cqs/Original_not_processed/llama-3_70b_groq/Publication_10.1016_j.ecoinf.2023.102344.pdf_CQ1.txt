Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches to image-based data for mollusc image analysis, particularly in the food traceability framework. It discusses the use of pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and their performance in classifying images. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data (images) were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
