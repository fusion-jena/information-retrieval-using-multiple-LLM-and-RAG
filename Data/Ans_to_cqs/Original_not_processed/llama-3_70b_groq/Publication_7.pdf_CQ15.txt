Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision problems, particularly in image classification and recognition tasks. It discusses the use of deep CNNs, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, but does not provide information on optimization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
