Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only discusses the loss functions used, the architecture of the PatchGAN discriminator, and the quantitative results of the model on the UCCS dataset. It does not provide information about the training process or the hyperparameters used in the model.
