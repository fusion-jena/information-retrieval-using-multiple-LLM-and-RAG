Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the funding, declaration of generative AI in scientific writing, declaration of competing interest, data availability, and model performance comparisons, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
