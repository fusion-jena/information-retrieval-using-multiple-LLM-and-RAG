Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that "Models were trained for 300 epochs and evaluated on the validation set after each epoch." This suggests that the training is completed after a fixed number of epochs (300 in this case), rather than based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau.
