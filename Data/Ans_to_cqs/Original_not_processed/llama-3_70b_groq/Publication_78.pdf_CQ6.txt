Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the framework steps for coral reef image classification, including image segmentation, feature extraction using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs, creation of a visual vocabulary, and classification using SVM. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.
