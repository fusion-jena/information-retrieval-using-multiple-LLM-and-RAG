Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing of bird song data, creating metadata files, and training the CNN and k-NN models. It also discusses the human-machine teaming aspect of the DialectDecoder program, where users can classify songs and retrain the network. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
