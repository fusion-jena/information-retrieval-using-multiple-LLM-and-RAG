Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on human-bear conflicts, and it discusses various statistical models and techniques used in the study, such as MAXENT, RF, ANN, and others. However, it does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
