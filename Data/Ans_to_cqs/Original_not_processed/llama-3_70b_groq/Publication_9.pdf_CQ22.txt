Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. Pixel accuracy (PxAcc)
2. Mean accuracy (MeanAcc)
3. Mean intersection over union (MeanIoU)
4. Frequency-weighted intersection over union (FreqIoU)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Mask R-CNN meta-algorithm in image segmentation tasks. The results of the evaluation are presented in Figure 7, which shows a bar plot of these four metrics by image source (iNaturalist, J.E. Randall).
