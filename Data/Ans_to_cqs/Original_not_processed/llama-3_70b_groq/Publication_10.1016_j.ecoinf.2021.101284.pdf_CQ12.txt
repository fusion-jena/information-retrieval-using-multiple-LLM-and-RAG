Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The only mention of deep learning is in the reference to a paper by Castillo (2020) that uses a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The rest of the context discusses statistical models and data processing, but does not provide information about the deep learning model used in the pipeline.
