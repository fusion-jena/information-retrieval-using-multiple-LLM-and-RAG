Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses raster bands stack as input data, which represents a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images. This suggests that the data format used in the pipeline is likely to be raster or image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically raster bands stack from satellite images.
