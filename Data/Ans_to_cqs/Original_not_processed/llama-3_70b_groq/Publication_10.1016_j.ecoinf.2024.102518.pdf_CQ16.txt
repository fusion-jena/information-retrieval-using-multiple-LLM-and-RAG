Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the delta.AICc value. The text states that "the optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible". This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the delta.AICc value reaches a minimum or is less than 2. 

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of AUC-ROC and CBI metrics to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not explicitly state that these metrics are used as criteria to determine when training is complete. 

It is worth noting that the context does not mention validation loss plateau as a criterion to determine when training is complete.
