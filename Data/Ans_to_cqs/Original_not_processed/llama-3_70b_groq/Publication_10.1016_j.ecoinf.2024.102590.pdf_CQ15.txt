Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses land-use and land-cover analysis, aerial image classification, and the use of Random Forest and GLCM texture metrics, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
