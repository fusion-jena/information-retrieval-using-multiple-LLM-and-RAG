Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It explains the process of training a deep learning (DL) network using annotated data and adjusting the model's parameters following an optimization process. However, it does not describe how the model's performance is monitored during this process.

It does mention that the evaluation of the network on the real problem is performed by feeding it an independent data set not seen during training (the testing data set), but this is done after the training process is finished, not during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
