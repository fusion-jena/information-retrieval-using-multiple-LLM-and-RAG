Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to wetlands, earth observation, and ecosystem health, but it does not provide specific information about a deep learning model or its purpose. 

However, based on the keywords and references provided, it can be inferred that the context might be related to land use classification, wetland mapping, or ecosystem health assessment using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. But without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of a deep learning model.
