Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for developing a BP-ANN (Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network) model. This suggests that the model was built using R and the 'neuralnet' package, but it does not provide information about the use of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
