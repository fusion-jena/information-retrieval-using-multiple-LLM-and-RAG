Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are overall error, commission error, and omission error. These metrics are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the provided context. The commission error is calculated as the ratio of false positives (FP) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). The omission error is calculated as the ratio of false negatives (FN) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN). The overall error is not explicitly defined in the context, but it can be inferred to be a combination of commission and omission errors.
