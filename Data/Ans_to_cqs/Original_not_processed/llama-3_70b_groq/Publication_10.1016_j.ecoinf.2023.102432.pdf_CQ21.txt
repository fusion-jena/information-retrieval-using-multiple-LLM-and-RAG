Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The text states that "the overall, producer, and user accuracy are reported" which suggests that these metrics are calculated after model training. Additionally, the presence of Tables A.2 to A.6, which are labeled as "Confusion matrix" for different imagery and algorithms, further supports this conclusion.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps or not.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as evident from the context, include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix.
