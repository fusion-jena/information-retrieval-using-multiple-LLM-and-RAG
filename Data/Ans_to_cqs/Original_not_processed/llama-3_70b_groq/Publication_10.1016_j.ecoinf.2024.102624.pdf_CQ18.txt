Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions. This involves randomly splitting the training dataset into 10 folds, using 9 folds for model training and 1 for testing, and repeating this process until all folds have been used as testing data. This approach helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA) and provides a distribution of 30 OAs, including minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. The smaller the range of possible model outcomes (OAs), the more reliable the prediction.
