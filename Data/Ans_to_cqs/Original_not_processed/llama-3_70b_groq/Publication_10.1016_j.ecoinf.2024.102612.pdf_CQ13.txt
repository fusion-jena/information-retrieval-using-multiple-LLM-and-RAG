Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context focuses on the methodology used for semantic classification of LiDAR point clouds, the use of synthetic data for training, and the validation of the model using real MS point clouds. It also discusses the importance of data augmentation and the challenges of training deep neural networks. However, it does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
