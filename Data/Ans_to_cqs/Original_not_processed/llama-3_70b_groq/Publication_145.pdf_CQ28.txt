Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm called U-net and very high-resolution multispectral images from the GeoEye satellite to identify and map canopy palms in the Amazonian forest. There is no information about the deployment platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform.
