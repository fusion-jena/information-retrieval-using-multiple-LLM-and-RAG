Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses various deep learning models, including CLIP, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and transformers, and their applications in image classification and few-shot learning. It also mentions that CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions, but it does not provide information on how these images were annotated. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
