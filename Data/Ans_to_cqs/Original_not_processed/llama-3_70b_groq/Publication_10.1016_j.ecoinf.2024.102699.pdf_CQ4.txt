Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

* Horizontal flip
* Vertical flip
* Horizontal roll
* Vertical roll
* Pitch shift
* Time mask
* Frequency mask
* Gain
* Loudness normalization
* Time stretch
* Tanh-based distortion

Additionally, noise is added from the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge, including:

* Gaussian noise
* Pink noise (background)
* Primary background noise soundscapes
* Secondary background noise soundscapes
* Background noise (e.g., wind, thunder, or aircrafts)
* Mixed up random bird species

These augmentation techniques are applied in the time domain, frequency domain, and spectrogram domains.
