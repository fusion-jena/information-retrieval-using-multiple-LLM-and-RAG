Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, namely ResNet-34. This is mentioned in the context as "We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists of a 34-layer convolutional neural network) architecture..."
