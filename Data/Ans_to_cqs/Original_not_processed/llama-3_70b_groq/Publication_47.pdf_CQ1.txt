Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of machine learning (IUC-NN) to evaluate the conservation status of the Orchidaceae family using the IUCN Red List, and discusses data quality and sampling bias issues. It mentions the use of digitally available occurrence records and herbarium specimens, but does not provide information on the original data collection methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
