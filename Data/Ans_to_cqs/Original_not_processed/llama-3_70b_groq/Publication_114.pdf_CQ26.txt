Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the text mentions that "to avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network, we performed data augmentation on the tree samples. The tree samples in the form of patches were rotated, mirrored, and flipped randomly."

This suggests that data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the impact of bias. However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It is possible that these techniques may be used in other contexts, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions that "diverse data collection" is used to increase the amount of tree species samples for training, which could be considered a technique to address data bias. However, it is not clear if this refers to a specific technique or simply collecting more diverse data.

In summary, based on the provided context, data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, but other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are not mentioned.
