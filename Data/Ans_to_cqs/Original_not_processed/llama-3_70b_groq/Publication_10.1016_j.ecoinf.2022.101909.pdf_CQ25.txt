Answer::: 
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN), is for the automatic task of detection and identification of 18 classes. This implies that the model is designed for classification, where it takes in input data (likely audio recordings) and outputs the corresponding class label (i.e., the species of bird). The model is trained to recognize patterns in the input data, allowing it to identify the species of birds based on their calls.
