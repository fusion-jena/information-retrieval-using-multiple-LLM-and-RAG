Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses various applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization algorithms in ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
