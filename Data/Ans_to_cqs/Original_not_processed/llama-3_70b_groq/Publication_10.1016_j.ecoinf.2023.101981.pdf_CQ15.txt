Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be discussing the detection of ungulate vocalizations using machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
