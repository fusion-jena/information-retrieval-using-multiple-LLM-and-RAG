Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing image processing and classification using techniques such as NDVI, histogram analysis, and texture variables, but it does not mention deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what optimization techniques are applied in a deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
