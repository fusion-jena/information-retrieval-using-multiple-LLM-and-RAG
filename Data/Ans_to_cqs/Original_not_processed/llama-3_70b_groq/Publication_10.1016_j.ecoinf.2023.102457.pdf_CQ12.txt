Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of BirdNET, a pre-trained CNN model trained on audio data of bird vocalizations, which was used to extract embeddings. Additionally, the context also mentions VGGish, another CNN model trained on a vast Youtube audio dataset, and Wav2Vec 2.0, which is not explicitly stated as a CNN but is a neural network model trained on human speech audio dataset. There is no mention of RNN or Transformer models in the provided context.
