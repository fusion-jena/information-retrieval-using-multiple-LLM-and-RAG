Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that after model training, there are manual quality checks, final data formatting, and classification steps involved in the workflow.

The context does provide information on the performance metrics calculated for the image quality model, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, as shown in Table 4. It also provides the performance metrics for the image quality model on the test data, including Precision, Recall, and F1 score, as shown in Table 5.

However, it does not mention any specific post-processing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the exact post-processing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
