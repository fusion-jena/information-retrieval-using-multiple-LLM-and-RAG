Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* 0-360Â° rotations
* Horizontal and vertical flips
* Changes in brightness (modulating the current values between 95 and 110%)
* Changes in saturation (modulating the current values between 95 and 105%)
* Changes in hue (modulating the current values between 99 and 101%)

These techniques were applied randomly to the input images.
