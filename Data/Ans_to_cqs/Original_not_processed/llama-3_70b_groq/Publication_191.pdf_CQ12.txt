Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of convolutional layers, feature maps, and filters in the context. Additionally, the context references specific CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is being used.
