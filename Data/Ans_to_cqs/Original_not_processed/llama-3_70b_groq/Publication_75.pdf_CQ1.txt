Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the experimentation and results of the deep learning models, specifically SeedNet, for seed image classification and retrieval tasks. It discusses the network architecture, experimental setup, and performance comparisons with other CNNs and traditional machine learning methods. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
