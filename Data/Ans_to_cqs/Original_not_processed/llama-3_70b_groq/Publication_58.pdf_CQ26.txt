Answer:::

According to the provided context, the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is the "median frequency balancing method". This is mentioned in the context as a method used to balance the data sets, which is necessary because neural networks do not perform well when trained with unbalanced data sets. 

It is not mentioned in the context whether other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.
