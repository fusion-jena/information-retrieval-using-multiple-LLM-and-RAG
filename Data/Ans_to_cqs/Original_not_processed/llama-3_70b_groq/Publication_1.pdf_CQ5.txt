Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity monitoring, particularly in processing and analyzing wildlife data streams. It mentions that the availability of large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using their UI makes the biodiversity monitoring application a prime candidate for the application of deep learning. However, it does not specify the exact datasets used in the pipeline.
