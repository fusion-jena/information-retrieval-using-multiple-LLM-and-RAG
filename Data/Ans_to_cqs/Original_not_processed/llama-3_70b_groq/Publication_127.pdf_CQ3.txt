Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning in automating information extraction from camera-trap images, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used.

However, it is mentioned that the system uses millions of labeled data from the SS project, which suggests that some form of annotation was performed on the images. Additionally, the context mentions transfer learning from the ImageNet dataset, which is a common practice in computer vision tasks. ImageNet is annotated with labels for 1,000 categories, but the specific annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not mentioned.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
