Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a classification approach using image bands and indices such as NDVI, as well as texture variables. The performance of this classification approach is evaluated using standard accuracies and kappa values, which are reported to enable comparison with other studies. There is no mention of precision, recall, or other metrics commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
