Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics related to camera traps, species identification, and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information about the availability of the code repository. The references cited are mostly research papers and articles, and there is no mention of a specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
