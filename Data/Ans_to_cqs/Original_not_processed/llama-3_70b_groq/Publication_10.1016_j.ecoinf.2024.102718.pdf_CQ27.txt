Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, training parameters, and performance evaluation of the BEiT model. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
