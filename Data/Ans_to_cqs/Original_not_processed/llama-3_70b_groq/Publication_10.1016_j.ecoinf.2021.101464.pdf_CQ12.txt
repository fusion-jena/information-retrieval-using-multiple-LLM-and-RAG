Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that "neural networks" are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. This suggests that some type of neural network is used, but the specific type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified. Additionally, a random forest model is used for parameter optimization, but this is not a deep learning model.
