Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be discussing a risk assessment model for the spread of Hyphantria cunea, a type of insect, and uses logistic regression equations to predict the risk probability of spreading transmission. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
