Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study only used image resizing as a preprocessing technique to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. There is no mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context focuses more on model training, validation, and deployment, as well as the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
