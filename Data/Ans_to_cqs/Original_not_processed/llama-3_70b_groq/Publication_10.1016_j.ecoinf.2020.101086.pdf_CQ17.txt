Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and sampling bias correction methods, with discussions on parameterization, performance evaluation, and comparisons of different correction methods. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.
