Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text only mentions the general topic of exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, but it does not provide details about a specific model used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer).
