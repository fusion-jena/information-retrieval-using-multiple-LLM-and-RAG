Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the validation accuracy of the model. The R2 value measures the goodness of fit of the model, while the RMSE value measures the average magnitude of the errors.
