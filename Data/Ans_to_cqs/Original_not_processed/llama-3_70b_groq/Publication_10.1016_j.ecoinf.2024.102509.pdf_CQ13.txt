Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the use of a backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model, its architecture, and its performance, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used to train the model.
