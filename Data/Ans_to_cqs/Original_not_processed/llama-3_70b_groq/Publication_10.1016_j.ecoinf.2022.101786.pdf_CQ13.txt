Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that some model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance the use of resources and training speed, but it does not specify which parameters were modified or what their values are. Additionally, it mentions that other parameters were kept to default or set according to guidance by the developers, but it does not provide further details.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
