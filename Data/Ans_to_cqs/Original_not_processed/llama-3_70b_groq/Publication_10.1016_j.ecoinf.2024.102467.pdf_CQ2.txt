Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article that discusses various topics related to deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision, but it does not provide specific information about the data formats used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that image data is likely used, as there are references to convolutional neural networks, image enhancement algorithms, and object detection models like YOLOv7. Additionally, the mention of EfficientNetV2 and MobilenetV2 suggests that image data might be used for training and testing these models.

But, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine if other data formats like audio, video, or CSV are used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
