Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Batch size: 16
* Learning rate: Initially set at 0.001, and subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was established at 1 × 10^(-5).
* Weight decay: 1 × 10^(-5)
* Hyper-parameter λ: 0.8
* Mk: Defined as 2k+1 (k = 1, 2, …K)
* β: 0.4
