Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to remote sensing data, such as images or raster data, since the study involves the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used is image data, but the exact format (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified.
