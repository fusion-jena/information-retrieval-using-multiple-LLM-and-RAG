Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the results of experiments with deep learning models for fish species classification, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
