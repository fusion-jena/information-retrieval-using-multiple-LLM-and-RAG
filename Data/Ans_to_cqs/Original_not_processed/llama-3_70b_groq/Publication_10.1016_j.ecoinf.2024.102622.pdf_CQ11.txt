Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing and vegetation indices, but it does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The references cited are primarily academic papers and do not include any information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository as requested.
