Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, it does mention data preprocessing in the context of data processing features.

According to the context, data preprocessing aims to prepare and facilitate data processing operations. It involves cleaning, transforming, or compressing the data to make it ready for the analysis stage. Data cleansing is a mandatory feature in data preprocessing, while other features are optional and depend on the needs or purposes of data analytics.

Although the context does not specifically mention normalization and scaling, it does imply that data transformation is a part of data preprocessing. Data transformation can include various techniques, such as normalization and scaling, to change the structure or format of the data.

In summary, based on the provided context, data cleansing and data transformation (which may include normalization and scaling) are likely involved in the preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps.
