Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through Google Image Search. Specifically, for the Google Search Image dataset, the authors automatically retrieve the top 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each of the selected labels. This suggests that the raw data is collected through web scraping or crawling of online image search results. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection in this particular pipeline.
