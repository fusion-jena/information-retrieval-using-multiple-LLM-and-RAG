Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses data splitting approaches, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models, but it does not mention specific techniques to address data bias.

However, it can be inferred that the authors are aware of the importance of avoiding systematic differences between the test and train datasets, as they mention that randomly splitting individual observations is generally considered optimum in machine learning. They also use a year-based splitting approach for the RY models, which ensures that the model is tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables.

But, the context does not provide information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
