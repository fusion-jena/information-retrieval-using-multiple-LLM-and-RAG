Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to agricultural applications:

* IP102: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Insect Pest Recognition (mentioned in [19])
* Internal Databases for pest detection and identification on tomato plants (mentioned in [21])

These datasets are specific to the agricultural domain and are not as well-known as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are general-purpose image classification datasets. If you're looking for information on general-purpose datasets, I don't have that information in the provided context.
