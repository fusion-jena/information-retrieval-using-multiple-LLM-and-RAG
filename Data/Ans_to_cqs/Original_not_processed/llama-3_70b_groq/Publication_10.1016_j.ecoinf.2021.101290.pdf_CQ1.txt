Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention sensors in the context of edge computing, where data is processed close to the sensor to reduce the amount of data to transmit. It also mentions LoRa (a long-range, low-power, wide-area network modulation technique) and Starlink (satellite-based internet access) as low-bandwidth solutions for transferring data from remote locations.

Additionally, the context mentions optogenetics, which involves the use of light to control cells in living organisms, and GStreamer, a pipeline-based multimedia framework. It also references a study on cormorant audiograms under water and in air, which may have involved data collection using sensors or other equipment.

However, the context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the data collection methods may vary depending on the specific application or domain. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
