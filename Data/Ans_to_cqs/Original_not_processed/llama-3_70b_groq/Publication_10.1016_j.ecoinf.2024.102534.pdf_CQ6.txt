Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be a list of authors and their contributions to a research paper or project, including tasks like writing, reviewing, editing, supervision, investigation, data curation, and project administration. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
