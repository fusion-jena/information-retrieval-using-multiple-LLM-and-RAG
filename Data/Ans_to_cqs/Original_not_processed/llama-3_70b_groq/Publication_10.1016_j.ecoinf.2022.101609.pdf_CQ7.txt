Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned in section 4.3.2 that "it is customary to randomise the dataset before splitting when there is a class imbalance - stratification". This implies that stratification is used when there is a class imbalance, but it does not provide a general criteria for splitting the data. Therefore, the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this specific case are unknown.
