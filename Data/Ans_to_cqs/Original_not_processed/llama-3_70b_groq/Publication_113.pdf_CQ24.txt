Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on active learning strategies, embedding models, and their applications in image classification tasks. 

However, it does mention random selection as a naive strategy for selecting samples to be labeled by the oracle in the active learning pipeline. This implies that randomness is acknowledged as a factor in the pipeline, but no specific strategies for handling it are discussed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
