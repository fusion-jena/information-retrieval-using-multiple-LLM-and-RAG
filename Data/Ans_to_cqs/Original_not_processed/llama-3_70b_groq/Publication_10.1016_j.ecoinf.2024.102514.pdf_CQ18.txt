Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored using various statistical measures such as R2, NSE, MEF, Z, Taylor statistics, RMSE, and MAE. These metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the eight machine learning models (ML, GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB) during both the training and testing periods. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the data was split into training and testing datasets with an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated on both the training and testing datasets to assess its performance. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned.
