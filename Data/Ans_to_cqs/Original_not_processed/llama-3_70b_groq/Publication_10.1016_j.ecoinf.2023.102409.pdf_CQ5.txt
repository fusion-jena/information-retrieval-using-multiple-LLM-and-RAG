Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention ImageNet in the context of the TernausNet architecture, which uses a VGG11 Encoder pre-trained on ImageNet for image segmentation. This suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used, but it is not explicitly stated as part of a deep learning pipeline.

Other than ImageNet, no other datasets like MNIST or CIFAR are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given information.
