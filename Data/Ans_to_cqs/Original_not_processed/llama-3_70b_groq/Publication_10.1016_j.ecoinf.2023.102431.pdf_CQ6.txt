Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on species and sex discrimination using FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) and discusses the importance of non-invasive survey methods in wildlife conservation. It provides information on sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups for discriminant analysis of species and sex, but it does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
