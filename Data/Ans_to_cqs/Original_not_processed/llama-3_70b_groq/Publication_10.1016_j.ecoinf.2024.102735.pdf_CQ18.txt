Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a validation set to tune the hyperparameters of the models. In Section III, it is mentioned that the training set was further randomly sampled to select training and validation sets to obtain optimized model hyperparameters. Additionally, in Section 4.2, it is mentioned that the authors used the Optuna package to realize optimized parameters using different random training datasets. This suggests that the authors used a validation set to evaluate the performance of the models during hyperparameter tuning, but the exact strategy or metric used to monitor the model performance is not specified.
