Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite imagery. The context mentions the use of Landsat-8 satellite data obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the selection of six bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands) for LULC classification. Additionally, the context discusses image preprocessing and image presegmentation, which further suggests that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a file format used for tabular data, and it is not mentioned in the context, so it is unlikely to be used in this pipeline.
