Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the research paper and its contributions, but it does not provide information about the availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
