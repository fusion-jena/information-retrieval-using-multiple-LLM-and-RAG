Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context provides references to various research papers and studies on mangrove forests, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the implementation details of the deep learning model, including the framework used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
