Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. 

The metrics mentioned are true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN), which are used to calculate precision (P) and recall (R). The precision and recall are calculated using equations (1) and (2), respectively. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are limited to the calculation of the mentioned metrics, but the exact steps are not specified.
