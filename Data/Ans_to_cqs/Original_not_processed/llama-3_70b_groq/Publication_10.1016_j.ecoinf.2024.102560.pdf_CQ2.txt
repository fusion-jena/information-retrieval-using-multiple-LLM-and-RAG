Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context discusses the use of various satellite-based datasets, such as CMAP, Landsat, and MODIS, for drought monitoring and land cover variation analysis. It also mentions the use of Empirical Wavelets Transform (EWT) for signal decomposition and data preprocessing techniques, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it.
