Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the performance of the FIT model is evaluated using a rank-based metric, where lower numbers indicate better overall performance. This metric is calculated by summing the rankings for both the BCR and DER and then calculating the average. 

It is not clear from the context what specific metrics BCR and DER represent, but they seem to be related to the performance of the FIT model. Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model.
