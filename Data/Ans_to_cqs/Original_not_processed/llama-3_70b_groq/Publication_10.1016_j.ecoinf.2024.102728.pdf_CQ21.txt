Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context appears to describe a methodology for classification, specifically the NHC (Nested Hierarchical Classification) methodology, and provides mathematical equations to explain the classification process. It does not discuss model training or postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
