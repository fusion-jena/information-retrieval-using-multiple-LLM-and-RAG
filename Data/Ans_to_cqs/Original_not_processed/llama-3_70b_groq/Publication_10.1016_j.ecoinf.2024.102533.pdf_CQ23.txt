Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context discusses a clustering approach for automatically classifying fish freshness, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study is diverse, as it includes seven different fish species and was generated over 11 days. This diversity in the dataset could contribute to the generalizability of the model. Additionally, the study suggests that extending the work to include other fish species could provide a more comprehensive understanding, which implies that the authors are aware of the importance of generalizability.

But, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken in this study.
