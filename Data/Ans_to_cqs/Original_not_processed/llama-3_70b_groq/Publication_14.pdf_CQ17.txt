Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Dropout is a form of regularization that randomly removes a proportion of nodes to reduce overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). 

However, L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may be used, but they are not mentioned in the given text. 

Therefore, the answer is that dropout is one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, but it is not possible to confirm whether L2 regularization is used based on the provided context.
