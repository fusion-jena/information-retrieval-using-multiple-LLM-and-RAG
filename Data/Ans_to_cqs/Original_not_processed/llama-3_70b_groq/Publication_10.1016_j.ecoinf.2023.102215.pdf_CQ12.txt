Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is evident from the mention of "U2-Net" as the base network in the feature extraction part of the TrunkNet model. U2-Net is a CNN-based architecture, and the use of terms like "dilated convolutions" and "receptive fields" further supports the conclusion that the model is a type of CNN. Additionally, the architecture of the MIF block's local-feature extractor, as shown in Table 2, also suggests a CNN-based design.
