Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosting, random forest, and artificial neural networks. It discusses the Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GSCV) technique used to identify the optimal hyperparameter combination for each algorithm. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
