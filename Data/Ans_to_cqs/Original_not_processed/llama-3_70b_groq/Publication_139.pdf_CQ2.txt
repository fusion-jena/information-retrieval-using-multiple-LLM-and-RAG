Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically spectrogram images. The text states that "analysis on spectrograms, pictorial representations of the raw audio data" is carried out, and that "select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual inspection" for annotation. Additionally, it is mentioned that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are typically used for image classification, are employed for audio data classification in this form. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
