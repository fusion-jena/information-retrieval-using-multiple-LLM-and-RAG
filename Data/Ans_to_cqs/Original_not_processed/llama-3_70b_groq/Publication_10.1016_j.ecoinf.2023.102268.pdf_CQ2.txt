Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is an image format, specifically spectrogram images. The context states that "these spectrogram images are input into the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN)" and that "an 850-ms long data segment is extracted from the unfiltered waveform around each detection to form a frequency-reassigned spectrogram image." This suggests that the input data to the CNN is in the form of spectrogram images, which are likely 2D representations of the audio signals. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
