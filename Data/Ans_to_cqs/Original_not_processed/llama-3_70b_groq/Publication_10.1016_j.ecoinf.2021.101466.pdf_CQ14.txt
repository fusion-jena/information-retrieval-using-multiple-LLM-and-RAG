Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the use of EfficientNet and YOLOv4 models, as well as various papers related to object detection and image classification, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
