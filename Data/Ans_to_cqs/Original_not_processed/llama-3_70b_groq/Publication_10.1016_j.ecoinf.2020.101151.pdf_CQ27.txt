Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to forest fires, vegetation, and human impact, with sections discussing vegetation, human impact, and lightning fires. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
