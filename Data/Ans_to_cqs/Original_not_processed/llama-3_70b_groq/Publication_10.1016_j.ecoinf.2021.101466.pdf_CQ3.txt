Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the IoU (Intersection over Union) is used as a threshold to consider correct or incorrect detection results, which implies that bounding box annotation is likely used. However, it does not provide any information about instance segmentation or other annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline beyond the implication of bounding box annotation.
