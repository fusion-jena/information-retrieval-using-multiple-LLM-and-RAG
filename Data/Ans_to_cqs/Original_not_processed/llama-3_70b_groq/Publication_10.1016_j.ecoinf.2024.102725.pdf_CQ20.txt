Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on research papers related to NDVI reconstruction, vegetation cover studies, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
