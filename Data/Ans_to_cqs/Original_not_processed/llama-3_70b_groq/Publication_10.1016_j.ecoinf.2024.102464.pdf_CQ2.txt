Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context appears to be discussing a study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables. The data formats mentioned in the context are not related to deep learning pipelines, but rather seem to be related to the input data for the machine learning models, which is not specified. Therefore, I cannot determine the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
