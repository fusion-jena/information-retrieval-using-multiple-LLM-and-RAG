Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction, time-series analysis, and applications in vegetation cover study, crop phenology detection, and wildfire event probability prediction. 

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected from remote sensing sources, such as satellite imagery (e.g., MODIS, Sentinel-2), as these are commonly used in NDVI-related studies. Additionally, the context mentions SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to optical image synthesis, which suggests that radar data might also be used as a source of raw data.

It is also possible that public datasets are utilized, as some of the referenced studies are published in remote sensing and environmental journals, which often rely on publicly available datasets. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
