Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that EfficientNetB0 is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. Additionally, ResNet50v2 is also trained on a million images from the ImageNet dataset. 

The dataset used in this specific work is referred to as PlanVillage, which is augmented to produce a new dataset. The augmented version of PlanVillage is used by different researchers for comparison. The dataset contains 55,448 images, which is increased to 61,486 images after applying a data augmentation technique.
