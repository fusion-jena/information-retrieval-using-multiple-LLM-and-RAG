Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, and it provides information about the model parameters and prior distributions. However, it does not provide information about the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
