Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The AutoML procedure described in the context generates candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values, but it does not discuss how to handle randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and dropout. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs of the experiment.

In the context of the AutoML procedure described, it is likely that some form of random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of results, but this is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline in this context.
