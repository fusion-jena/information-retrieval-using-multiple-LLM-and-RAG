Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context discusses the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in fish species classification, compares traditional classification methods with CNNs, and mentions the use of contrastive loss and Siamese networks. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
