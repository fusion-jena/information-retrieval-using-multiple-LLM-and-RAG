Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used to preprocess the data, such as:

* Applying rotations and symmetries to the thumbnails to capture all possible positions of the fishes, which can be seen as a form of data augmentation to increase diversity.
* Creating a class for the background with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails, which can help to reduce bias towards a specific type of background.
* Ensuring that the class "fish" contains less samples than the specific fish classes to avoid bias towards the generic class.

It does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques were used in this specific pipeline.
