Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for land cover/land use classification, El Niño southern oscillation analysis, and other related topics. It does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the mentioned studies might have been collected from various sources such as public datasets, sensors, or surveys, but this is not explicitly stated. For instance, the study on El Niño southern oscillation might have used climate data from sensors or public datasets, while the land cover/land use classification study might have used satellite imagery or survey data. 

In conclusion, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and more information is needed to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
