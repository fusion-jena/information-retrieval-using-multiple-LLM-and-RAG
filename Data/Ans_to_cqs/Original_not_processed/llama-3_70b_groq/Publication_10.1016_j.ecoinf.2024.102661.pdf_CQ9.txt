Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, particularly LSTM, for forecasting agricultural carbon emissions in China, and mentions various studies and their findings. However, it does not provide information about the availability of the data repository or the pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
