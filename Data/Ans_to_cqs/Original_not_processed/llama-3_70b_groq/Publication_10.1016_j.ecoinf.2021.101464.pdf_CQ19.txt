Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention building a deep learning model or using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it mentions using the R statistical software and the "RandomForest" package to implement a random forest model. Additionally, the "rfPermute" package is used for environmental factor importance score and significance test. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model used is a random forest model, not a deep learning model, and it is built using R and its associated packages.
