Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the study used a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, where the model was trained on the training set and its performance was evaluated on the test set. The evaluation metrics used to monitor the model performance include accuracy with assigned tolerance (AC_T1 and AC_T2), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), cross-validation R2 (CV_R2), and average angle deviation from the line 1:1 (AD). These metrics were used to assign a score to each model, but the specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not described.
