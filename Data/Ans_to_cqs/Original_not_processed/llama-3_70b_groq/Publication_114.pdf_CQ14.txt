Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only provides information about the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and their performance metrics, but it does not discuss the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
