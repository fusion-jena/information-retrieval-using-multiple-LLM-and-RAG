Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing a literature review or research study on species distribution models (SDMs), and it provides information on the search strategy, screening process, and data extraction methods used in the study. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
