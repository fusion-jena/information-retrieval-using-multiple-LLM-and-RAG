Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. 

However, it does mention data collection and database extension for digital soil mapping, which could be related to addressing data bias. But, it does not provide specific information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this specific query.
