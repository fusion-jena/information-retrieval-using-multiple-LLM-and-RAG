Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data pre-processing, convolutional neural networks, and data post-processing steps. It discusses the splitting of data into blocks and smaller areas, as well as the post-processing steps to transform the CNN results into a GIS-resource. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected in the first place.

It is possible that the authors assume the reader is familiar with the data collection methods or that the focus of the paper is on the processing and analysis of the data rather than its collection. In any case, without further information, it is not possible to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.
