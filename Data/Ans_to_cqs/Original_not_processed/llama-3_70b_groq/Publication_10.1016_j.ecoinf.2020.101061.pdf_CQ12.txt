Answer: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions "convolutional neural networks to learn flexible deep features" and "approaches that learn features from data using neural networks" in the context of computer vision. Additionally, the text discusses the use of ImageNet pretraining weights, which is a common practice in CNN-based image classification tasks.
