Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and a supervised ML classification approach, but it does not specify the type of model used. The context focuses more on the data sources, processing, and application of the FIREMAP system, rather than the specific details of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
