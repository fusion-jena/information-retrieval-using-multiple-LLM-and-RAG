Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in Landsat image classification, particularly in detecting invasive species, and the benefits of incorporating phenological knowledge into the deep learning process. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that are typically performed before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
