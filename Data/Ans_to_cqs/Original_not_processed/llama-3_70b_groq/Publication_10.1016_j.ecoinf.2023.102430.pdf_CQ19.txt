Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). However, it does mention that the implementation was done in MATLAB (www.mathworks.com) for the AN model. Additionally, it mentions that the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms (AB, GB, HB, and LD) were run in Python (www.python.org) using the scikit-learn toolbox. There is no mention of a specific deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
