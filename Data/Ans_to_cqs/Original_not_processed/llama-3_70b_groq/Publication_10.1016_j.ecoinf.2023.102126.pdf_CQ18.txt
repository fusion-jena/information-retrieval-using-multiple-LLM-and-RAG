Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the use of the F-UJI tool to evaluate the FAIRness of datasets, and the creation of a report to visualize the scores obtained from the evaluation. There is no mention of machine learning models or their training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training based on the provided context.
