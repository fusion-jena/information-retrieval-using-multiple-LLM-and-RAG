Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the implementation of the proposed framework is based on the DELE (Deep Extreme Learning) philosophy, which suggests that the model might be an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) or a variant of it. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder, which is a type of autoencoder. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
