Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the importance of interpretability in deep learning models, particularly in remote sensing applications, and mentions various techniques for evaluating interpretability, such as gradient-based sensitivity analysis, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and class activation maps. However, it does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, or other common evaluation metrics.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
