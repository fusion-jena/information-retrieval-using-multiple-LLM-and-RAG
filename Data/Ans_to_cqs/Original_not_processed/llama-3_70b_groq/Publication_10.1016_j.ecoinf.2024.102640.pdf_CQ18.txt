Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the R2 metric is used to assess the model's fit to the observed data during the training of EPDNet. This suggests that the R2 metric is used to monitor the model's performance during training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model during training.
