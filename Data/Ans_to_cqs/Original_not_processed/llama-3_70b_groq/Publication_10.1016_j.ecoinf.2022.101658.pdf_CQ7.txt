Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets based on the field sites where the data was collected. Specifically, the data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm, while the data collected at Conklin (CK) was used solely for independent validation. 

This suggests that the criteria used to split the data were based on the geographical location of the field sites, with two sites used for training and testing and one site used for validation. However, the exact proportion of data allocated to each set (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation) is not specified in the provided context.
