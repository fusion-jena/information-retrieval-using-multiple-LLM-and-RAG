Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned applications and research areas, we can make some inferences.

In the context of deep learning, the paper by LeCun et al. (2015) provides a general overview of deep learning, but it does not specify particular data formats.

The paper by Kovalev et al. (2016) compares the performance of different deep learning frameworks, but it does not mention specific data formats either.

The research on bird calls and audiograms (Larsen et al., 2017; Lohr et al., 2003) suggests that audio data might be used in some deep learning applications. However, the data formats used for storing and processing these audio data are not specified.

The passage discussing the data stream layer and event-stream processing mentions that the microphone array produces eight data streams, but it does not specify the format of these streams.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It is likely that various formats such as image, audio, video, CSV, and others might be used depending on the application and research area, but this information is not explicitly provided.
