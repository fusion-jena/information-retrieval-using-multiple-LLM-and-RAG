Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the model, the methods used to handle varying length audio data, and the performance of different CNN-based models, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
