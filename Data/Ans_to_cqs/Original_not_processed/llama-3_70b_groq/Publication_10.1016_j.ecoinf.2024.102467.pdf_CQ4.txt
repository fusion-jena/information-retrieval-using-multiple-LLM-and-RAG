Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and articles, but it does not provide specific information about data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, but it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context does discuss various deep learning models and techniques, such as gradient descent optimization algorithms, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, and YOLOv7, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
