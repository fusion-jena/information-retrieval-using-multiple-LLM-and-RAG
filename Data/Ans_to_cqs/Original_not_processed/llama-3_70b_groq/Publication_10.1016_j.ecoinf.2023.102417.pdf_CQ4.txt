Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the importance of training deep learning models on datasets that resemble the data they will be applied to, the concept of data drift or domain drift, and the need for domain adaptation to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties. It also discusses the Joint Energy-Based Semantic Segmentation (JESS) model and its applicability to remote sensing images. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
