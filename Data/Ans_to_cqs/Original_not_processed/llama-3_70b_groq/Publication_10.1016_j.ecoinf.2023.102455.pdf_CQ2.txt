Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the CNN-BiGRU model, hyperparameter tuning, and the formulae used for feature extraction and normalization. There is no mention of specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model is used for daily streamflow forecasting, which suggests that the input data might be in a numerical or time-series format, possibly in a CSV or similar format. But this is only an inference, and the exact data format is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
