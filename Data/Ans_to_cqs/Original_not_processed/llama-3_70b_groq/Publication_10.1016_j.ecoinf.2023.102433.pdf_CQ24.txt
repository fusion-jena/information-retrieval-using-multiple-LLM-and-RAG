Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to various topics such as IoT-enabled smart farming, MODIS data processing, digital twins, and landscape ecology, but it does not provide information about deep learning or randomness handling strategies.

The only mention of a random process is in the description of the procedure for selecting 3000 sites for maize fields in Veneto, Italy, where it is stated that the sites were "randomly selected" from the center point locations of maize fields. However, this is not related to deep learning or handling randomness in a pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
