Answer::: 

The context provides some information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. According to the text, the model parameters are optimized using the gradient descent Adam algorithm with all parameters set to default values. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned. 

Therefore, we can conclude that the optimizer used is Adam, but the learning rate is not specified in the provided context.
