Answer:::
The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the samples were split into training and validation sets according to a 60%â€“40% ratio. This suggests that the data was split randomly into two sets, with 60% of the samples used for training and 40% used for validation. There is no mention of a test set or any specific criteria used to split the data beyond this ratio.
