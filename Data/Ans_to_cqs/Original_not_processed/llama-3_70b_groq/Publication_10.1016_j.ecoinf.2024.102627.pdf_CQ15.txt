Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text explains the framework for predicting species assemblages using a deep neural network, the loss function used (cross-entropy), and the objective of minimizing the average species assemblage size while guaranteeing a certain level of accuracy. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to update the model parameters, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
