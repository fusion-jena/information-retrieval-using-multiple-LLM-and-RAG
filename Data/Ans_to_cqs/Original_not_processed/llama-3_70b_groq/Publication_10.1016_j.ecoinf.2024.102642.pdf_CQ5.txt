Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used in this study are related to cetacean vocalizations, specifically SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall. The evaluation dataset for SEIO PBW vocalizations is called SWAMS, which consists of 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program at the SWAMS site in the Indian Ocean. This dataset contains 102 manually annotated vocalizations by a second expert.
