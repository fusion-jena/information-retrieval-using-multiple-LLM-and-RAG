Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and experimental setup, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the calculation of forecasting performance metrics in Section 4.1, which suggests that some form of evaluation or analysis is performed after the model training. But the exact postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix, are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
