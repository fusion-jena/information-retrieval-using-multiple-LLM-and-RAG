Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to climate modeling, species distribution, and microclimatic analysis, but it does not provide information on data collection methods. The papers cited discuss topics such as downscaling climate data, species distribution models, and microclimatic analysis, but they do not mention the specific methods used to collect the raw data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
