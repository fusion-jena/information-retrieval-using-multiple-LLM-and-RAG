Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to conservation biology, ecological corridors, and species distribution models, with a focus on seahorses. It discusses the use of various biodiversity databases and tools such as GBIF, OBIS, INaturalist, and AquaMaps, but does not mention deep learning models or cloud platforms. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
