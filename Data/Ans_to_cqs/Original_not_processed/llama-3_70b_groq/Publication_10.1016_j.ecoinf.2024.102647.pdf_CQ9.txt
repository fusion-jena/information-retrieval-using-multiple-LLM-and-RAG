Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of the CART algorithm and other methods for ranking groundwater salinity influencing variables and predicting potential future saline zones in southern Iran. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository, and therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository is available.
