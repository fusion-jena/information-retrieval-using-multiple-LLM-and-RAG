Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be discussing a Monte Carlo method-based classification model for predicting real-world phenomena such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation. It discusses the limitations of the model, potential modifications, and its application to a real wildfire case. There is no mention of deep learning or data splitting criteria.
