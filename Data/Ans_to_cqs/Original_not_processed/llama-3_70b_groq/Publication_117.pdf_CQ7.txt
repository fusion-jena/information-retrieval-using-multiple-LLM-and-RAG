Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that 500 survey images were randomly selected to be used exclusively for training. This suggests that the data was split into a training set of 500 images, but it does not provide information on how the remaining data was split for testing and validation. 

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
