Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets in a database. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not discussed in the context. If you need information on these techniques, I can provide general information, but it would not be based on the provided context.
