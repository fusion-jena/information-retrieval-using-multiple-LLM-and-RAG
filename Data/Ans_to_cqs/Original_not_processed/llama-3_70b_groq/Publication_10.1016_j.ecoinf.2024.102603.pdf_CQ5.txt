Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications in estimating the Fv/Fm parameter. It mentions that deep learning models require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results, but it does not specify which datasets are used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
