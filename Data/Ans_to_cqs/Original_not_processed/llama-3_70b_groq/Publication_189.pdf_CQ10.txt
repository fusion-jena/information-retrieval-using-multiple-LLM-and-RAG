Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a report that discusses various deep learning models and techniques, including Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). The context provides details about the models, their architectures, and the experimental setup, but it does not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
