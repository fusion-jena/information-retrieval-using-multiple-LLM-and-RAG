Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses weakly-labeled settings, different types of noise in labeling, and the challenges of evaluating predictive performance on incomplete data. It also mentions assessing prediction accuracy by checking whether the largest predicted fraction of each observation equals the true dominant vegetation cover type. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
