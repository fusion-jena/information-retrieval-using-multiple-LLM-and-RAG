Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a ResNet152-architecture model, which is a variant of the ResNet model developed for image classification. However, in this case, it is used for audio classification and is trained from scratch with randomly initialized weights. The input to the model is a mel spectrogram representation of 3-second sound frames, which is a common approach in audio signal processing.
