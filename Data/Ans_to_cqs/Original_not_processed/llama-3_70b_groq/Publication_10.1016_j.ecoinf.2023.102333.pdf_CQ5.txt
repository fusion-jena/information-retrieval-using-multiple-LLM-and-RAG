Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, the study uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for Earth observation to classify land cover/land use (LCLU) for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP). The dataset used in this study is not a traditional deep learning dataset, but rather a remote sensing dataset.
