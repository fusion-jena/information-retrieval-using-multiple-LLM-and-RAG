Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the architecture details of the EF network, CSVM model, and SN model, which all consist of convolutional layers (Conv) and Max-pooling layers. The use of convolutional layers and Max-pooling layers is a characteristic of CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
