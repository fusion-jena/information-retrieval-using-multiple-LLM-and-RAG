Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, nor does it discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models, specifically random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), for ecological studies and species distribution modeling. It discusses the effectiveness of these models and the development of an ensemble model by integrating RF and Maxent. However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
