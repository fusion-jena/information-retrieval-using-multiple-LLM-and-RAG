Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or pipeline. The text appears to be describing a decision support tool for equitable nutrient reduction, and it discusses features such as zooming, searching, and filtering, as well as environmental justice indices and pollutant loads. There is no mention of deep learning models or any specific type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
