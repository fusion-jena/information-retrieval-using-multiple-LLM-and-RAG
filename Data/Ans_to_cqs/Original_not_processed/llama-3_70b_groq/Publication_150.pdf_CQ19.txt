Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The context only discusses the architectures of the models, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, and their training parameters, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
