Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the two-phase process of building a classification model and tuning risk thresholds for each class. It discusses the goals of minimizing misclassification error rates and maximizing correct classification rates, but it does not provide information on the training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
