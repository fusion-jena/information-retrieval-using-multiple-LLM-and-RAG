Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis, fisheries acoustics, and spatial-functional data analysis, with no mention of deep learning or neural networks. The tables provided seem to show performance metrics for different models or experiments, but the optimization techniques used are not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
