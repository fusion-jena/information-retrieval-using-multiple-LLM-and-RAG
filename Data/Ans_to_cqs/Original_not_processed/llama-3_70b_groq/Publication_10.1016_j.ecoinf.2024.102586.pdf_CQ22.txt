Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it mentions the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of supervised learning technique. The performance of the RF model is evaluated based on the change in prediction error, and the relative importance of each predictor variable is calculated based on the median obtained from 30 repetitions. There is no mention of metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of the model.
