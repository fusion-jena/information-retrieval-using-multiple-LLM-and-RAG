Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors employed data augmentation as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. This is mentioned in reference 53, "Further advantages of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks." However, the specific techniques used for data augmentation are not explicitly mentioned.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. The authors do mention that they extracted a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait before model training, which was used as a test dataset for independent evaluation of the trained models. The remaining data was split into a training dataset and a validation dataset by a ratio of 4:1. However, this is not specifically mentioned as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, the only technique mentioned in the context that could be related to addressing data bias is data augmentation.
