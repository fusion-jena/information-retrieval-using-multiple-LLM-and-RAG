Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss, or plateau. The context appears to be discussing research limitations, SHAP values, and study areas, but it does not provide any information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
