Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a research paper on using convolutional neural networks for pollen species identification, and it provides information on the model training process, including the batch size, learning rate, and decay factor. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that were taken after training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
