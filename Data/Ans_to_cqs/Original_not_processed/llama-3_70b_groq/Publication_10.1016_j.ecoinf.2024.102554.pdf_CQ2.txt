Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the pipeline is NetCDF (Network Common Data Form). This is mentioned in Figure 2, which describes a crawling tool developed to get historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, and the data is stored within these NetCDF files. NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. It is commonly used in scientific and research applications, particularly in the fields of climate, weather, and Earth science. There is no mention of other data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV in the provided context.
