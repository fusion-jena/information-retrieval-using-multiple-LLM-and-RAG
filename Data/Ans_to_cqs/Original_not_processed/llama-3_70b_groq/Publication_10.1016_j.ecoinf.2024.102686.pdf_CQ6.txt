Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks and clustering, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it does mention data preprocessing steps in the context of data sources and processing, which include using ArcGIS10.5 software for spatial data processing. But these steps are not specifically related to deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
