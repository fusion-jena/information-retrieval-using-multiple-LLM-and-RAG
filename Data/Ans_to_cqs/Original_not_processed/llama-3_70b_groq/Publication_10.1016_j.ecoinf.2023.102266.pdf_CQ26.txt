Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "variance-reduction strategies" such as "importance sampling" and "stratified sampling" in the context of improving the estimator given by Eq. 6. 

It can be inferred that stratified sampling might be used to address data bias, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique for addressing bias in the context of deep learning pipeline preprocessing. There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, the answer is that the provided context does not provide sufficient information to determine the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
