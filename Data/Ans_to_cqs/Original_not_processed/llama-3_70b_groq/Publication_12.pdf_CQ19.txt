Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The text only mentions the use of BatNet, ResNet_v2, and references to other machine learning and bioinformatics tools such as Scikit-learn and Geiger. It does not provide information about the underlying framework used to implement these networks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
