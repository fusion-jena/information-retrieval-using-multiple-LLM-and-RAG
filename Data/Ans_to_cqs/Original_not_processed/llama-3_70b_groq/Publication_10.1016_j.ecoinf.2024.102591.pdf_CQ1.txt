Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) is used to collect data on wildfire events, which are then used to validate the vegetation recovery product in FIREMAP. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data for burned area discrimination. It also mentions the use of harmonized S2 post-fire Level-2 A data from the COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED dataset in Google Earth Engine (GEE). 

It can be inferred that the raw data is collected through a combination of satellite imagery and possibly other remote sensing technologies. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
