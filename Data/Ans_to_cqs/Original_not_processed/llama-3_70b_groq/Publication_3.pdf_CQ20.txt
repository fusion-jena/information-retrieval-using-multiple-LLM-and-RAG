Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the model architecture, the challenges, and the results, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. It only mentions that TensorFlow's flexible architecture allows easy adaptation and deployment on different platforms, including desktops, clusters of servers, edge devices, and mobile phones, but it does not specify which hardware resources were used in this particular case.
