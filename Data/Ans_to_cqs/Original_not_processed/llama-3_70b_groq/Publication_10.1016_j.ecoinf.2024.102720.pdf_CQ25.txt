Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. It only mentions that strategic planning is based on a deep learning algorithm (IseB 21, 9) and that deep learning models are used for improved fusion in multi-scale data research (Ren et al., 2021; Wu, 2022). However, it does not specify the purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or others.
