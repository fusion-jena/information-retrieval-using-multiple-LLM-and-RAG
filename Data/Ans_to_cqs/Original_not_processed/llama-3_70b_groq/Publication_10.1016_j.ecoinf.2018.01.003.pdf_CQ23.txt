Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network) model and an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model. 

To ensure the generalizability of the BPNN model, the authors used 5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. This means that the dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets five times, and the model was trained and evaluated on each split. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure generalizability. The authors only used data from 2014 and 2015 as the test dataset, which may not be representative of the entire dataset.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide enough information about the dataset, such as its size, distribution, and diversity, which are important factors in ensuring the generalizability of a model.
