Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing, aerial scene classification, and geographic information system software (QGIS), it can be inferred that image data formats are likely used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions "aerial scene classification" and "remote sensing," which suggests that the data formats used might be related to image or raster data, such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, or PNG. However, this is an educated guess, and the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.

It is also possible that other data formats, such as CSV, might be used in the pipeline for storing or processing non-image data, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In summary, while image data formats are likely used in the pipeline, the exact formats are not specified in the provided context.
