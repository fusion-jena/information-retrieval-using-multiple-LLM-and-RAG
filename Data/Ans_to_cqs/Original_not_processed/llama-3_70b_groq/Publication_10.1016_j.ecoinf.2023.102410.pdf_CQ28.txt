Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or using any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing data analysis, author contributions, and data availability. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
