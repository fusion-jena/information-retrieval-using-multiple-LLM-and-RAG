Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically YAMNet, is for detection. In this case, it is used for goat vocalization detection. The model is used to extract embeddings from audio data, which are then fed into a sequential and reduce mean layer to map to the available labels. The model is designed to facilitate generalized sound recognition applications, and in this specific context, it is used to detect goat vocalizations.
