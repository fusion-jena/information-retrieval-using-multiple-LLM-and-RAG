Answer: The Google Cloud platform was used. Although the query asks about deploying a deep learning model, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform was used for image processing, data access, and parallel processing for analysis. GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform, and it is mentioned that the GEE cloud platform has been widely used for various applications, including mangrove extraction, aquaculture ponds, and intertidal zones. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Google Cloud platform was used, although the specific deployment of a deep learning model is not mentioned.
