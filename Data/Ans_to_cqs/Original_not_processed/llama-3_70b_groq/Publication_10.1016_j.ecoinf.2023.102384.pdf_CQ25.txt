Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is counting, specifically pest counting. The model is designed to estimate the insect count within a given Region of Interest (RoI). It utilizes different counting strategies, including counting by detection (where bounding boxes are computed), counting by regression (where a target map is predicted), counting by density estimation (where density maps are produced), and counting by segmentation (where segmentation maps are generated). The model is trained using annotated data and is intended to accurately count the number of pests (in this case, whiteflies) in images, while ignoring other insects and contaminants that may be present.
