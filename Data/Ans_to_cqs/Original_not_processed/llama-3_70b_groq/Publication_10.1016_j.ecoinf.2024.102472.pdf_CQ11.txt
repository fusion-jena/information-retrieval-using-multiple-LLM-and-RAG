Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and excerpts from various research papers and studies related to remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental monitoring. None of the provided text mentions a data repository link or a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
