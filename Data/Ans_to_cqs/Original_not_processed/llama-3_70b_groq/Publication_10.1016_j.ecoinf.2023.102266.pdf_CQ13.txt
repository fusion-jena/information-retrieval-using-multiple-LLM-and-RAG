Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing a cellular automaton model and its properties, with mentions of machine learning tools and variance reduction strategies, but it does not provide specific details about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
