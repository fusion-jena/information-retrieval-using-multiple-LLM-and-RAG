Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, specifically in identifying and counting animal or plant species, and the challenges associated with it. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification tasks, data preparation, and model training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
