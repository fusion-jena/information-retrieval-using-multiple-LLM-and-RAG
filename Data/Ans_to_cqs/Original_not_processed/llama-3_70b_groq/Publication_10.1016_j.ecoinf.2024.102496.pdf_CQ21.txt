The provided context does not mention model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing a tool for analyzing and visualizing environmental data, including pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics. It describes the features of the tool, such as zooming, searching, and filtering, as well as the display of data on a map. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which are typically associated with postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
