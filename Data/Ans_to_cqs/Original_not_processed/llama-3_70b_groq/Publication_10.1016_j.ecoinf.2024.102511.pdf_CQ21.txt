Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning in bioacoustics, specifically in species classification using acoustic signals. It provides references to various studies and tools related to acoustic signal processing and machine learning, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context. However, in general, common postprocessing steps in machine learning include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, generating confusion matrices, and visualizing saliency maps to interpret the model's predictions.
