Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text discusses the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies in animal behavior studies, but it does not specify the particular type of DL model used. It mentions the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural networks, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
