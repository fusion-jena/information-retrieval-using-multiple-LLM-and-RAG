Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses Gaussian process regression (GPR), neural networks (NN), and other machine learning models, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The context focuses on the architectural details of the algorithms, the number of neurons in the hidden layers, and the input and output layers, but it does not mention the hyperparameters used in the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
