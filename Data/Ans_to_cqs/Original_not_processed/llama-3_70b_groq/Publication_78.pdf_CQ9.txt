Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the use of deep learning techniques for coral classification, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
