Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is for acoustic detection. It is being used to automatically detect the calls of a target species of interest, in this case, the Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls. The model is trained to identify and classify the calls, and then used to estimate the population size of the species.
