Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the CNN architecture used is the inception model extended with batch normalization. This suggests that batch normalization is one of the preprocessing steps involved, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, but it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the datasets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that batch normalization is involved, but I do not know about other preprocessing steps.
