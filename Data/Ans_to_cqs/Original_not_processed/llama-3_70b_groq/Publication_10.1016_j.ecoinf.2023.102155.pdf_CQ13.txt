Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a statistical modeling package called ppmlasso, which is used for spatial modeling and prediction. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are related to the ppmlasso package, such as sp.scale, cov.bias, kVal, and n.fits, but they are not related to deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
