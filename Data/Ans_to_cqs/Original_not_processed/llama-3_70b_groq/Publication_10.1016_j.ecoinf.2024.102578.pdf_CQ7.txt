Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information on data splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
