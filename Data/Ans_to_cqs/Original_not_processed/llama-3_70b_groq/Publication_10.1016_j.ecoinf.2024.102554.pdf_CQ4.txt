Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on discussing a crawling tool for collecting historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, and the characteristics of the data stored in NetCDF files. It also mentions the Sentinel-3-related products and their temporal resolution, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
