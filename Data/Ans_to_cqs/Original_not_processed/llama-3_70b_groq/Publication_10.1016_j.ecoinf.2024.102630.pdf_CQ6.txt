Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the data sources, datasets, and author contributions to the study. It discusses the different NDVI datasets used, such as MOD13Q1 V6, CDR AVHRR NDVI, and GIMMS NDVI, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study, as that information is not provided in the given context.
