Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the basics of deep learning, its application in ecological prediction, and the importance of training data and network architecture.

However, it does mention "Batch Normalization" in the reference Ioffe and Szegedy (2015), which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a deep neural network. This helps to reduce internal covariate shift and accelerate the training process.

Other than this, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or feature engineering. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for training a deep learning model, but they are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
