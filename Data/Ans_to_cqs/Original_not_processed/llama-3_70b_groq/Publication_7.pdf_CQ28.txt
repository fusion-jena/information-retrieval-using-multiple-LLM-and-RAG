Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and image classification, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model based on the given context.
