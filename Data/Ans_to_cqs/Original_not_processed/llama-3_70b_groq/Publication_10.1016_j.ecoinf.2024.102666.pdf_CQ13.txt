Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses atmospheric correction algorithms, specifically the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, and its applications in aquatic environments. It also mentions other studies and algorithms related to remote sensing and land cover classification, but does not provide information on deep learning model hyperparameters.
