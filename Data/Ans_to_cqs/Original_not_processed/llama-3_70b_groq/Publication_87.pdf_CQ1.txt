Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is mentioned in the section "2 Collecting images with camera traps", which suggests that camera traps are used to collect images of animal species, including the Eurasian lynx and its preys. These images are then used to train and validate deep learning models for species identification.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. However, it can be inferred that camera traps are a primary method for collecting data in this specific case study.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. The answer is specific to the case study presented and may not be generalizable to other deep learning applications.
