Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline in the plant identification domain utilizes public datasets as a method for collecting raw data. Specifically, the text mentions the PlantClef2015 dataset, which is a public dataset containing around 113,205 images of plants. Additionally, it compares the PlantClef2015 dataset to other public datasets such as ILSVRC 2010, which suggests that public datasets are a common source of raw data for deep learning in this domain.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data in the provided context. It is possible that other methods may be used in other domains or applications, but based on the provided information, public datasets appear to be a primary source of raw data for deep learning in plant identification.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data collection process, and it is possible that other methods may be used in addition to public datasets. However, based on the information provided, public datasets appear to be a key source of raw data for deep learning in this domain.
