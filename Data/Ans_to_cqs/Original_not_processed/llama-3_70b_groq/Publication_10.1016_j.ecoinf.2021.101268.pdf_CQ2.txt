Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically JPEG images. This is inferred from the multiple instances of "JPEG" mentioned in the text, suggesting that the dataset consists of JPEG images. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. The context also discusses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application to image data, further supporting the conclusion that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline.
