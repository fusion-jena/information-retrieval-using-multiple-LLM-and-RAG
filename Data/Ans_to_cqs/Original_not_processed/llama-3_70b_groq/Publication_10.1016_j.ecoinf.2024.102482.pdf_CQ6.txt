Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the system structure, the use of LSTM models, and the importance of feature selection in machine learning-based systems. It discusses the limitations of using a finite set of patterns as features and the potential information loss due to clustering, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context, as it is not mentioned in the provided text.
