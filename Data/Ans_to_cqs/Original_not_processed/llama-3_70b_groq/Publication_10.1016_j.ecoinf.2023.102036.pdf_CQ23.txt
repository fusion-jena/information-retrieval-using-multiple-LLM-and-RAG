Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of model training parameters and the experimental setup. It does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure model generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a limited dataset, as mentioned in the context, which might raise concerns about overfitting and generalizability. The use of existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals might help mitigate these concerns, but the context does not provide further details on this.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
