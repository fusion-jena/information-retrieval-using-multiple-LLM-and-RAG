Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is evident from the mention of Conv2d convolution, BatchNorm2d, and activation functions, which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a backbone network, neck network, and head network, which are common components of object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a type of CNN.
