Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the soundscape VAE, including the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions. It also mentions the use of a wide residual network with a width scaling factor K = 4 and depth scaling factor N = 3. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used for training the model, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
