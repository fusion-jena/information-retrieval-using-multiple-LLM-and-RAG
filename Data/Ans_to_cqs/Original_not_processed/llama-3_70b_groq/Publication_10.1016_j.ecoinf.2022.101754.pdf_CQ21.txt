Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the training and validation set, regression models used, and the evaluation metrics calculated. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context only mentions that tuning of hyperparameters was done on the training set, followed by model training using the optimal hyperparameter setting. It then presents the results of the model evaluation using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, AD, ACT1, and ACT2. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
