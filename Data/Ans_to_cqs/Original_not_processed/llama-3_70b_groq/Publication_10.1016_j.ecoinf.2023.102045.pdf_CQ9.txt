Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a paper about a R package called "cblindplot" that helps color blind people visualize spatial patterns. The text discusses the package's features and potential connections to other R packages, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
