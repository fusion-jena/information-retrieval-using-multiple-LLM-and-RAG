Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. This implies that the data was split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. 

The context also provides information on the size of the testing dataset, which consists of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect. However, it does not provide information on the size of the training and validation datasets or the criteria used to split the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
