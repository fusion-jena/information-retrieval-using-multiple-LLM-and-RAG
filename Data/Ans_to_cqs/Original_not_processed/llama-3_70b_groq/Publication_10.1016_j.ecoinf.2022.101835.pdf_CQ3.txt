Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and their optimization using Optuna. It discusses the hyperparameters and performance metrics of these models, but does not mention data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
