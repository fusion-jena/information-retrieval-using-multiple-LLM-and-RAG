Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be focused on the results of calculations with different parameters (conv_base.trainable and Dropout Rate) for ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50, as well as the environment and materials used in the study. There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other criteria used to determine when training is complete.
