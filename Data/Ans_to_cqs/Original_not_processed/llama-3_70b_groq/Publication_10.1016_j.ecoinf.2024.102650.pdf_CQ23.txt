Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as topic modeling, machine learning methods, and text preprocessing, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability. It mentions the use of the ERNIE model, which has achieved significant results in previous studies, but it does not elaborate on the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used in the study. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
