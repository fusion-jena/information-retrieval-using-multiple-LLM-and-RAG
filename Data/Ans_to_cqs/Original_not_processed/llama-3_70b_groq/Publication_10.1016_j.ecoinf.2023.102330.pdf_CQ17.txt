Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic detection of covey calls and its integration with autonomous recording units (ARUs) for density estimation. It discusses the data augmentation process, the CNN model's performance, and its potential limitations, but it does not delve into the details of regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
