Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that both datasets (SSLs' and elephants') were split into training and testing images with a ratio of 80:20, respectively. This suggests that the model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate subset, which is a common practice to prevent overfitting and ensure some level of generalizability. 

However, it does not provide information on whether the datasets were diverse, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
