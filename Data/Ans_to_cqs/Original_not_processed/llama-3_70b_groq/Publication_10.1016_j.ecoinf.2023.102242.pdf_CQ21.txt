Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the need for feature optimization tools. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
