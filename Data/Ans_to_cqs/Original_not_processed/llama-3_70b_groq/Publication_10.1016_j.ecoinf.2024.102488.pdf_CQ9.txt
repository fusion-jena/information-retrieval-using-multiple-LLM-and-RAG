Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and ecology, discussing various types of remote sensing data, such as GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery, and their applications. It does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or where its data repository might be located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
