Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on image classification using Random Forest (RF) and discusses the importance of acquiring large-scale training data, the number of training samples required, and the classification process. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
