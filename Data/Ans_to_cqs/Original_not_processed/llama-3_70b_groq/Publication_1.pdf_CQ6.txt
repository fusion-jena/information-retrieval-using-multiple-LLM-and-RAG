Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the concept of Deep Learning, its applications, and its properties, but it does not delve into the specific preprocessing steps required for training a deep learning model.

However, it is well-known in the field of machine learning that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data for training, improve the model's performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance or outliers.

Normalization and scaling are used to transform the data into a common range, which helps the model to converge faster and improves its performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the data.

While the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, it is essential to perform these steps before training a deep learning model to ensure optimal performance.
