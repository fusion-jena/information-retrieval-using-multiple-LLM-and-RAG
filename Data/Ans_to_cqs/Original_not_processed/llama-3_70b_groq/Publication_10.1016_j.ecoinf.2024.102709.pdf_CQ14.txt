Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that k-fold cross-validation (k = 5, epochs = 500, imagesize = 640) is used to determine the ideal training-test split for the model, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are tuned. 

It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using grid search, random search, or another method, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided information.
