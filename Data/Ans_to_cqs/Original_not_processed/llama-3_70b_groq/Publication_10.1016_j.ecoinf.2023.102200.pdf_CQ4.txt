Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods for image segmentation, object detection, and classification in various domains such as wetlands, forestry, and brain tumor image analysis. It discusses the use of different algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN, PointNet, and SLIC, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
