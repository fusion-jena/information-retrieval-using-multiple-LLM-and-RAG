Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and integrating multiple datasets to account for biases in biodiversity datasets. It mentions using dataset-specific weights or factor interactions to account for differences in included datasets, as well as using a dedicated model that combines multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets together through a joint likelihood in a Bayesian setting.

However, it does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection that are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
