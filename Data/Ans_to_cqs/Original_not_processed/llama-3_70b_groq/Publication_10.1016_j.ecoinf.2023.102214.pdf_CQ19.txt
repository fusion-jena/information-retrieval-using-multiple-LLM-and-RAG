Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that the machine learning advancements used in the study were partially funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. However, it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
