Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in wildlife conservation, aerial surveys, and image processing. It discusses the use of deep learning models for detecting animals in aerial imagery, but it does not delve into the preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a "Stratified" approach (SW stratum employing the SAL) during the fine-tuning process, which might be related to stratified splitting. But it is not clear if this is used to address data bias specifically.

In general, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine which techniques are used in this particular context.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
