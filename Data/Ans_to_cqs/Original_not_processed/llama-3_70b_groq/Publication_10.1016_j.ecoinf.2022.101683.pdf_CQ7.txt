Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as being related to deep learning models. However, based on the context, it appears that the data was split into training and test sets for model evaluation, but not specifically for deep learning models.

The context mentions that the data was split into a training set (75% random) and two test sets: Test set #1 (25% random) and Test set #2 (Irish records only). This suggests that the data was split randomly, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% used for testing, and an additional test set created using only Irish records. There is no mention of a validation set.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide information on deep learning models, and the evaluation metrics mentioned (AUC, TPR, TSS, Kappa, and Omission) are commonly used in species distribution modeling and machine learning, but not specifically in deep learning.
