Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics, but it does not specify the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics of the trained models in section 2.6, but it does not provide details about the specific metrics used or how they were calculated. 

Additionally, the context focuses more on the development of a web application for alate detection on sorghum leaves, and it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
