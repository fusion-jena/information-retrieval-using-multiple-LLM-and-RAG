Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context only mentions that a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture was developed, and the input factors were population size and GDP, with the predicted output being GHGdwts. It also mentions that 70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. However, it does not provide information on whether a diverse dataset was used, cross-validation was performed, or stratified splitting was employed to ensure the generalizability of the model.
