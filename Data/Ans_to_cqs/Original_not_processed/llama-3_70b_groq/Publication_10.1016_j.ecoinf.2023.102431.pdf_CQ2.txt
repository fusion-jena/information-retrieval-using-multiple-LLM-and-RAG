Answer: 

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be focused on using camera trap images and track collection to identify species and sex, with the use of FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) to geo-reference tracks and extract morphometric variables. The data formats mentioned are not related to deep learning, but rather to the collection and analysis of track data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
