Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a specific platform where the deep learning pipeline data is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models, such as XGBoost and ANN, for estimating carbon stocks in a reforested urban landscape in South Africa. It provides information on the study area, materials and methods, and references to other studies, but it does not mention a data repository or provide a link to access the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
