Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the classification process, feature extraction, and the use of deep neural networks for image classification. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing, and it does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
