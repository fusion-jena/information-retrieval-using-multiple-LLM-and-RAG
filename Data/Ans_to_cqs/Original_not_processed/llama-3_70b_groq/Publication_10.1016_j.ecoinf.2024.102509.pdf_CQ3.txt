Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their applications in predicting variables, combining multiple data sources, and improving overall prediction accuracy. It also mentions the importance of the quality and quantity of the sample dataset, the optimal number of hidden layers, and the over-fitting problem. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
