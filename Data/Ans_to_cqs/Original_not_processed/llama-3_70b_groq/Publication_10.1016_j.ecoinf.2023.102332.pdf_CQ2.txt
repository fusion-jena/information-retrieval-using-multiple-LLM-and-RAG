Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with text data, specifically social media data. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats. The context mentions the use of word embedding techniques such as Word2vec and BERT, which are typically used for natural language processing tasks. Additionally, the tm package in R is mentioned, which is a text mining package. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is text data, likely in the form of CSV files or other plain text formats. However, this is an indirect inference, and the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used.
