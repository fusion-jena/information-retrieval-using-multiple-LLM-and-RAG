Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that the learning algorithm is "usually in a supervised fashion, such that the learning algorithm... is told what the desired output is for each input data sample." This implies that some form of annotation or labeling is involved, but the exact techniques used are not specified. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
