Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be focused on the design and functionality of a system called CASE, which involves tasks, questionnaires, and geo-objects, as well as a multidimensional spatial cube for analytical purposes. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
