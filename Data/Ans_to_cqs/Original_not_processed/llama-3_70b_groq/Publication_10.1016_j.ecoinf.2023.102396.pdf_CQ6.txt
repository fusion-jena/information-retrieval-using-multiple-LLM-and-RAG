Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, population dynamics, and time series analysis, but it does not provide information on deep learning model preprocessing.

The context mentions natural log transformations of the number of rabbits, but this is not a general preprocessing step for deep learning models. It is specific to the Gompertz population model used in the context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context. The query requires knowledge of deep learning preprocessing steps, which is not provided in the given context.
