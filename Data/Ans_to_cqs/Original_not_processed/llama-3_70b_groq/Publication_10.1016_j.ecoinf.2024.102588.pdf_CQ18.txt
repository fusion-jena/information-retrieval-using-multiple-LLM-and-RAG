Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of early stopping. According to the text, "The early stopping option stopped the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved." This means that the model training was stopped when the validation accuracy reached a plateau and could not be improved further, indicating that the model had converged. This strategy helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is trained optimally.
