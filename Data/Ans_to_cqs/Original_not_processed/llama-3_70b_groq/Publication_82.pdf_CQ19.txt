Answer::: 

The context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention that all the experiments were conducted using the authors' own fork of Caffe, which is a fast, open-source framework for deep learning. Therefore, the answer is Caffe, but it does not include TensorFlow or PyTorch.
