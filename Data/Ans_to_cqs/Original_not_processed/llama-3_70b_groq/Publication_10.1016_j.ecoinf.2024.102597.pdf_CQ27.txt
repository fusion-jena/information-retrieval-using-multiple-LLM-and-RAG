Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model. In fact, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. The context focuses on the development and comparison of various machine learning models, including ensemble learning models, for estimating water quality parameters. It discusses the performance of different models, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluation methods, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained deep learning model.
