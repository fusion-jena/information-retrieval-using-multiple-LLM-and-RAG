Answer::: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K. These datasets are used for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios. COCO-Stuff is a dataset including 164 K well-annotated images, Cityscapes is a benchmark dataset for the semantic understanding of urban street scenes, and AED20K is a large-scale dataset for general scene understanding, consisting of 150 semantic categories. Additionally, a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) is proposed for training the GVI-learning model.
