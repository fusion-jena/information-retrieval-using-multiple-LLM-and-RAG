Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the CNN model, as well as its application in water quality monitoring. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
