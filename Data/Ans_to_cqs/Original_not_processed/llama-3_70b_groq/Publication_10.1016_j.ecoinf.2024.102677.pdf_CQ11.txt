Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The table in the context lists three sources for the datasets used: https://www.resdc.cn/, https://www.tpdc.ac.cn/, and https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/. However, these links are not related to the deep learning pipeline, but rather to the datasets used in the study. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
