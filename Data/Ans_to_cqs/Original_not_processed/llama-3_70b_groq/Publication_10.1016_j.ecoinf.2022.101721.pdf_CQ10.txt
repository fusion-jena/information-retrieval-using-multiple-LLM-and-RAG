Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text mentions an R-code in supplement S1, which is likely a supplementary material accompanying a research paper, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. The context discusses the use of machine learning for species identification and provides some statistical results, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link.
