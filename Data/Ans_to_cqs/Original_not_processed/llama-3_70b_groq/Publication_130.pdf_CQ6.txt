Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention oversampling as a technique to mitigate the issue of imbalanced datasets, where the classes have different numbers of training pictures. 

In the context, the authors applied limited oversampling to their training dataset by duplicating pictures of the less sampled classes until they had 900 images available for training. This suggests that they may have performed some form of data augmentation, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
