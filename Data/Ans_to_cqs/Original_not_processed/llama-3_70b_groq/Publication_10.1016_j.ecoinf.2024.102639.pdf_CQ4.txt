Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification, as well as dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
