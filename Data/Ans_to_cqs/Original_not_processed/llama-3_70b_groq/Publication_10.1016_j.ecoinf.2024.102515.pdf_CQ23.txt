Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses the DIVERSIMAR project, which involves searching for tweets that express interesting finds, and the methodology used to filter and process the tweets. It also mentions the limitations of the approach, such as the difficulty of obtaining useful information from tweets due to their brevity and potential lack of clarity. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
