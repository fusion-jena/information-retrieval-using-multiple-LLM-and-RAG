Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the training process, model architectures, and evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and queries per second (QPS). However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context does mention the calculation of the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss during training, but it does not elaborate on any postprocessing steps. It also presents the results of the experiments in a table, but it does not provide details on how the results were obtained or what postprocessing steps were involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
