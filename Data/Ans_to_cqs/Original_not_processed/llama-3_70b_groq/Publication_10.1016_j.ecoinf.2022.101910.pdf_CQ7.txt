Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily discusses the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and its application in monitoring challenges. It also mentions some technical details about BirdNET, such as adjustable settings and confidence thresholds, but it does not provide information about data splitting criteria for model training.
