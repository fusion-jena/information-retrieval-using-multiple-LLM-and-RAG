Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of five training folds, which suggests that some form of cross-validation is being used to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

In the context of generating prediction records, the use of five folds and averaging the resulting prediction records together may help to reduce the effect of randomness on the final predictions. This approach can help to increase the robustness of the model and reduce overfitting.

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other strategies, such as setting a random seed value, are being employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
