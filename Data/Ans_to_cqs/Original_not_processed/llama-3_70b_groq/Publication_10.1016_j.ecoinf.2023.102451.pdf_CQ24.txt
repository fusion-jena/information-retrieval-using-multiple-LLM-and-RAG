Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different deep learning models, including the proposed EMViT-Net, on a specific dataset (EMDS-6) and discussing the architecture and experimental setup of EMViT-Net.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and dropout. By setting a random seed value, the randomness is fixed, and the results can be reproduced.

In the context of the provided information, it is not clear whether a random seed value was set or not. If you need to know the specific strategy employed in this particular experiment, it would be necessary to consult additional information or the original research paper.
