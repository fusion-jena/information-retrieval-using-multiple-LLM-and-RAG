The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a predictive model for soil water content (VWC) and its evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on the model's architecture or training process, including any measures taken to ensure generalizability such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
