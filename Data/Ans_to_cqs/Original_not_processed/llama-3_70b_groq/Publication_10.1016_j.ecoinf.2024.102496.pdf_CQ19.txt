Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about building a deep learning model or using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, discussing environmental justice, soil loss, and biochemical oxygen demand. It also mentions various best management practices (BMPs) and a geodatabase available for download. There is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
