The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Pl@ntNet classification tool is available through a dedicated API at my.plantnet.org, and the 'plantnet' R-package is available online at https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet. Additionally, it is mentioned that the data can be shared via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org). Therefore, it can be inferred that the data repository might be GBIF, but it is not explicitly stated.
