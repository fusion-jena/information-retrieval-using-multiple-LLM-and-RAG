Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). It only discusses the architectures and components of the models, such as UNet, VGG16, EfficientNet, and Count-ception, but does not provide information about the framework used to implement them. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
