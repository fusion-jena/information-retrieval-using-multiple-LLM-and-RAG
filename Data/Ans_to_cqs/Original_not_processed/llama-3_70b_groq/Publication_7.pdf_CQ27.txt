Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the classification process, the use of deep neural networks, and the extraction of image representations from a pre-trained VGGnet. It also mentions the fine-tuning of the network using the Benthoz15 dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
