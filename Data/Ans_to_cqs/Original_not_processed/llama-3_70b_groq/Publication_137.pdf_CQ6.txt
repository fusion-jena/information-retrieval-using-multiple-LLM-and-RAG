Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the authors used the hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets, but the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions voxelization subsampling size (voxel size) as a parameter that was adjusted during the experiment, which could be related to preprocessing, but it is not clear what specific preprocessing steps were taken.

In the references cited, Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) discuss batch normalization, which is a preprocessing step, but it is not clear if this was used in the experiment described in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
