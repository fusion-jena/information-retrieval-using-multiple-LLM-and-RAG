Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and the comparison of software programs for bird song detection. It does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the optimization of a recognizer via automated and manual processes, which might involve some preprocessing steps. Additionally, the creation of subsets of recordings for training, testing, and target sets might also involve some preprocessing. But the specific steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
