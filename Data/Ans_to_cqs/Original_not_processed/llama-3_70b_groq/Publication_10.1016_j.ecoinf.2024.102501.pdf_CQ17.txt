Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses various machine learning and deep learning models used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, including SVR, LSTM, GRNN, RBFNN, MLPNN, and ELM. It also mentions different studies and their approaches to predicting DO concentration, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
