Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological niche models, and it discusses the evaluation of different algorithms and metrics, such as AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA, but it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training.
