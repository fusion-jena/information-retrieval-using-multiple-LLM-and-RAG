Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a specific type of ANN called NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous inputs) model. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models.
