Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the mathematical model of a multilayer feedforward neural network, its learning process, and error correction stage. It also cites various research papers on different topics, including ecology, environmental science, and machine learning. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
