Answer: 

The context provided does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it does discuss the splitting of data for machine learning model training. According to the text, the data was split into three parts: 70% for training, 30% for testing, and 10% of the training data was used for validation. This is mentioned in section 5.3.1, "Classification algorithms in GEE". 

It is worth noting that the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data, but rather a stratified sampling approach was used to collect the samples. The reason for choosing 70% for training and 30% for testing is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
