Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection and classification. Specifically, the model is used to separate empty images from images with animals, humans, or vehicles, and then classify the detected objects by type (rock, bait, empty, and species). The model is also used to identify high-quality images. The approach combines training custom site-specific models with a highly performant openly available model, MegaDetector, to achieve these tasks.
