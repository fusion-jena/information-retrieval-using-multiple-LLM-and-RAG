Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification. The text mentions "automatic or supervised classification" and "classification of larger areas" as potential applications of machine learning methods. Additionally, it discusses the possibility of using machine learning to refine classifications with the help of online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products. The text also explores the idea of using "human in the loop" classification, which combines human pattern recognition with machine learning methods for classification.
