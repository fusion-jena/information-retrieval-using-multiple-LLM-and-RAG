Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) algorithm, which is a type of artificial neural network, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
