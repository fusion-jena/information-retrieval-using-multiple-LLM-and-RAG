Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, network architecture, and results of the ablation experiments. It provides details on the training parameters, such as batch size, input image resolution, number of epochs, learning rate, and optimizer, but does not discuss any techniques used to improve the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
