Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on leaf area index (LAI) estimation using satellite image data and various algorithms, but it does not discuss data augmentation techniques specifically. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
