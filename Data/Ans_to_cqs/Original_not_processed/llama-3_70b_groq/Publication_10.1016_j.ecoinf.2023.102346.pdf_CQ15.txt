Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling and habitat suitability prediction using machine learning algorithms, but it does not delve into deep learning or optimization techniques. The mentioned algorithms are traditional machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and others, but not deep learning algorithms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
