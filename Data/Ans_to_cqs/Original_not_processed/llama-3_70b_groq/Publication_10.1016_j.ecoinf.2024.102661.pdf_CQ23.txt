Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using the TPEBO algorithm, particularly for LSTM neural networks. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters, the search ranges for certain hyperparameters, and the pseudo-code for the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or model evaluation techniques that could ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
