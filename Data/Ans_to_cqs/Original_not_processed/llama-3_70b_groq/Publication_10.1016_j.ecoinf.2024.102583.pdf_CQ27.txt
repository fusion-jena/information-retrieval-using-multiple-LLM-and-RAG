Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The text discusses various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, and their applications in landslide susceptibility mapping. It also provides information about the characteristics and advantages of these models, but it does not provide details about the deployment process of a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
