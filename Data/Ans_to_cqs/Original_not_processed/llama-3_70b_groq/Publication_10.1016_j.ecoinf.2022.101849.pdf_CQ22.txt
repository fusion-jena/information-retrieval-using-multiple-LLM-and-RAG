Answer: 

The context does not mention a deep learning model. It mentions a k-nearest neighbours regression model, which is a traditional machine learning model, not a deep learning model. 

However, it does mention the evaluation metric used, which is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the k-nearest neighbours regression model. 

Additionally, for evaluating the prediction accuracy of dominant vegetation cover types, the approach is similar to a classification task, where the prediction accuracy is measured by checking whether the largest predicted fraction of each observation equals the true dominant vegetation cover type.
