Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, nor does it provide any information about the purpose of such a model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and evaluating the performance of different models using various metrics, but it does not mention deep learning. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
