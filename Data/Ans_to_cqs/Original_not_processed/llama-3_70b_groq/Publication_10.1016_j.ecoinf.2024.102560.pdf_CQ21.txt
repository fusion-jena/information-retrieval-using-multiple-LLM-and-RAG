Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to environmental science and ecology, discussing topics such as soil erosion, lake desiccation, and drought forecasting. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is the domain where postprocessing steps like those mentioned in the query are typically applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
