Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on analyzing multifrequency acoustics data using Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and provides various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2, but it does not discuss the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
