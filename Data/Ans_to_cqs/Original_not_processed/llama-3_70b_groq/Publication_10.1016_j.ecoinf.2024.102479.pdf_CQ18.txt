Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. This technique is used to evaluate the performance of the models and prevent overfitting by dividing the dataset into k subsets. Some of these subsets are used for training the model, while the others are utilized to evaluate its performance. In the present study, a 10-fold cross-validation design was employed, where the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training while the remaining 30% was used as a testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for evaluation.
