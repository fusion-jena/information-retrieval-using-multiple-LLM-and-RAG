Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context suggests that the datasets used are custom datasets specific to the Arctic wildlife monitoring project. The datasets consist of images from camera traps in Finnmark and Yamal, which were manually classified into "Bad" and "Good" quality images. The total dataset comprises around 72,000 images (15,000 "Bad" and 57,000 "Good" quality images) for each location, which were used to train separate two-class models for Finnmark and Yamal using the ResNet-50 architecture.
