Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The papers and excerpts mentioned discuss the use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), and marker-controlled watershed algorithm, but do not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other frameworks were used.
