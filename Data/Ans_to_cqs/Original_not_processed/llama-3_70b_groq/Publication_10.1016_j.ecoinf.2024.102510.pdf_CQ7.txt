Answer: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are ratios of the dataset allocated to the training set, validation set, and testing set. In the provided context, three data split strategies are mentioned: 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10. These ratios indicate the proportion of the dataset used for training and validation/testing. For example, in the 60:40 split, 60% of the dataset is used for training, and 40% is used for validation and testing. Similarly, in the 80:20 split, 80% is used for training, and 20% is used for validation and testing, and so on. These ratios are used to evaluate the models' abilities to learn from a larger dataset and identify any underfitting or overfitting issues.
