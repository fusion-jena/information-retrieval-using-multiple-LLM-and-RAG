Answer::: 

The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that a hyperparameter search was performed to identify the right level of regularization for the classification and regression models. The search ranges for the hyperparameters C and Î± are provided, along with the resulting accuracy plots (Fig. C.1 and Fig. C.2). However, it does not specify whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to explore these ranges. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
