Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, which do not form coherent sentences or phrases that can be used to answer the query.

The context does contain some recognizable elements, such as numbers and symbols that resemble Unicode character codes, but these do not provide any meaningful information about evaluating the performance of deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
