Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation. This approach is used to search for the optimal parameters of the Random Forest model, including the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features).
