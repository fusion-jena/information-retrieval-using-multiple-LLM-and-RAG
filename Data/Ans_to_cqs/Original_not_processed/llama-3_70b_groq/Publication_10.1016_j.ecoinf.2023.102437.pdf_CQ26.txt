Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly Random Forest (RF) and Lasso models, for time series forecasting and feature selection. It also discusses the signature method and its limitations.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to mitigate data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
