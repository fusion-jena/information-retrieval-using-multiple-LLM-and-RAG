Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that users should "anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved." This suggests that the training process may involve multiple iterations of model training and evaluation until the desired level of performance is reached.

Additionally, the context mentions that the validation images had mean IoU scores >50%, indicating excellent performance. This could imply that a certain threshold of IoU score or other performance metrics may be used to determine when training is complete. However, the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training are not explicitly stated.

In summary, while the context provides some insights into the training process, it does not provide a clear answer to the query about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
