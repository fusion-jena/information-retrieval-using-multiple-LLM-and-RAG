Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the concept of tasks, transfer learning, and the proposed methodology of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) for improving learning by restricting overconfidence during transfer learning. 

However, it does mention the execution time analysis of the approaches and the improvement of IFTL over other approaches (GRNN and SVR) in terms of error reduction, as depicted in Fig. 6. But it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
