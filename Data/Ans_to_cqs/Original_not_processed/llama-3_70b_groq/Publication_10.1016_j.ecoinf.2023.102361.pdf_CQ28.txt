Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the dataset, the process of splitting the dataset, and the different deep learning models used, including DenseNets and MobileNetV2. It also mentions the performance of these models on the dataset. However, it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
