Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on deep learning models for streamflow forecasting, including CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, and CNN-BiRNN, and their performance evaluation using metrics like R, RMSE, and MAPE. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
