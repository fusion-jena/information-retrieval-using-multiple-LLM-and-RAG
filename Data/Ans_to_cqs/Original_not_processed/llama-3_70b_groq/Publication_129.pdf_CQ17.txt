Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN models, such as Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet, and their applications in image recognition tasks. It also discusses the loss function used for training the CNN detection network, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
