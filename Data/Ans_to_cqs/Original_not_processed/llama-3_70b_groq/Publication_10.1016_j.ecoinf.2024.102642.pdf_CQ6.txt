Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the annotation process, annotation guidelines, and the effects of annotation variability on model performance. It also discusses the training process, including the hyperparameters used, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
