Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. According to the context, "early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the validation set)" was used. This means that the model's performance on the validation set was monitored during training, and if there was no improvement for 10 consecutive epochs, the training was stopped. This is a common strategy to prevent overfitting and to select the best-performing model.
