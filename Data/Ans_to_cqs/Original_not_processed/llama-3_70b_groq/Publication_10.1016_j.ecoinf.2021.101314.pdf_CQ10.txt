Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing a research paper on ecological informatics, and it provides details on the methodology and results of the study. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context does provide a link to a website (http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html), but it is not a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository as it is not mentioned in the context.
