Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe the preprocessing steps involved in preparing the audio data for the YAMNet model. 

These steps include:

1. Converting the audio to a monophonic channel and resampling it at 16 kHz.
2. Extracting the spectrogram using STFT magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.
3. Calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.

These steps are specific to audio data preprocessing and may not be applicable to other types of data. The context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps that may be necessary for training a deep learning model.
