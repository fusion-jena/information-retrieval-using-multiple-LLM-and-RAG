Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the Wav2vec model, Attention-based hybrid CNN-LSTM, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM, as well as their applications in speech recognition and audio classification tasks. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
