Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the model, including the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and layer normalization. It also references other studies and techniques, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
