Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are:

1. Rotation: A 90-degree rotation range is applied.
2. Zoom: A zoom range of 20% is applied.
3. Shear: A shear range of 20% is applied.
4. Horizontal shift: A shift range of 20% in width is applied.
5. Vertical shift: A shift range of 20% in height is applied.
6. Brightness: A brightness scale between 0.2 to 1.0 is applied.
7. Horizontal flip: A horizontal flip is applied.
8. Vertical flip: A vertical flip is applied.

These techniques are used to expand the dataset and enhance the efficiency of the CNN model.
