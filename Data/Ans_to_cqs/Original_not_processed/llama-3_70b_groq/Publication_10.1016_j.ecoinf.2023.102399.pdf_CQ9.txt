Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. The context includes the article's abstract, a figure, and some equations, but it does not mention specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
