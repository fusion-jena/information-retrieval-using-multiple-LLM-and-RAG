Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various deep learning models and their applications, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and conference proceedings, but none of them seem to be a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
