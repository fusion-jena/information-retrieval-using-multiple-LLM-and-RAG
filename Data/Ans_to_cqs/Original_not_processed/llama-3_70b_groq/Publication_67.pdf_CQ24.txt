Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for tree cover classification using satellite and aerial images.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques like data augmentation, which can help in reducing overfitting and improving the robustness of the model to random variations in the data. Additionally, the context cites a paper by Neelakantan et al. (2015) that discusses the idea of adding gradient noise to improve learning in very deep networks, which might be related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

But, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer to this query.
