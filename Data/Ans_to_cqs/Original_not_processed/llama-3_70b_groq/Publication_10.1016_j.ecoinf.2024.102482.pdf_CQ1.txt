Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline vary depending on the specific application. 

In the case of biomonitoring for water quality pollution detection, the raw data is collected through the observation of the swimming behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (Choi et al., 2012; Jeong et al., 2019). This suggests that biological monitoring methods are used to collect data.

In another instance, shell image analysis is used to collect data for geographical traceability of common cockle (Concepcion et al., 2023). This implies that image data is collected through shell image analysis.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts (Herdy et al., 2024), which may involve the use of sensors or remote sensing data.

However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of surveys or public datasets for raw data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include biological monitoring methods, image analysis, and potentially sensor or remote sensing data.
