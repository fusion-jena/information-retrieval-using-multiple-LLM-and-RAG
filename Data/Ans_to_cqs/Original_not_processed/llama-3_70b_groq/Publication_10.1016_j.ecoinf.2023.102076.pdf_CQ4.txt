Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. In fact, the text only mentions data augmentation as a potential solution to alleviate the issue of poor classification performance when the target class makes up a small proportion of the text. It suggests oversampling of the minority class as a possible data augmentation technique, but it is not applied in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
