Answer:::

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The PLUS model uses a random forest algorithm in the LEAS module to obtain development probabilities of each land use type, but it does not discuss handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS) in the CA model, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in this mechanism.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query.
