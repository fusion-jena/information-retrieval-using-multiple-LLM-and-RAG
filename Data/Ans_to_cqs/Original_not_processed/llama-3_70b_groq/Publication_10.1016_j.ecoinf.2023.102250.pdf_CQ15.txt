Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the discriminator, spectral normalization, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition. It discusses the use of LeakyReLU activation functions and the application of spectral normalization to ensure Lipschitz continuity and stable training of GANs. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
