Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the CNN architecture in Table 3, which outlines the layers and parameters of the model. Additionally, the context mentions other CNN-based architectures such as VGG16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet121, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
