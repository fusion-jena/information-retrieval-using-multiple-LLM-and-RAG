Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses model evaluation metrics such as AUC, TPR, TSS, Kappa, and Omission, as well as the threshold selection method used in the study. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criterion for training, such as validation loss plateau or convergence of a specific metric.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
