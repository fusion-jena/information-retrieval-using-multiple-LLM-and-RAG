Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and references related to remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental monitoring. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the provided context.
