Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from various public datasets and sources. Specifically, the data sources mentioned include:

* https://code.earthengine.google.com/ (likely for NDVI and other satellite-derived data)
* https://www.resdc.cn/ (for vegetation type data and GDP data)
* ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/ (for temperature and precipitation data)
* https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/ (for radiation data)
* https://www.openstreetmap.org/ (for road data)
* CMIP6 (for meteorological data with a spatial resolution of 500 m)

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. It seems that the study relies heavily on publicly available datasets and remote sensing data.
