Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be related to a study on equitable stormwater management, environmental justice, and nutrient reduction, and it discusses various indices, tools, and practices related to this topic. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training.
