Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). This 80-10-10 split allowed for a more extensive training set, which can lead to a better-generalized model. The test set, which the model had not seen before during training or validation, was used to evaluate the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

Another measure taken was the use of cross-validation with a fixed number of folds (ten, in this case) through GridSearchCV. This provided a reliable estimate of the model's performance, balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, and guarding against overfitting. The hyperparameter tuning process involved a detailed and systematic search across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, which ensured that the eventual choice of hyperparameters was not arbitrary but backed by empirical evidence.

While the context does not explicitly mention diverse datasets or stratified splitting, the use of cross-validation and a systematic hyperparameter tuning process helped to ensure the generalizability of the model.
