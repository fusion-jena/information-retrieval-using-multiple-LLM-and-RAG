Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide an example of how the data was split in the specific experiment described.

In the experiment, the authors split the 100 images of each class (Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation) into 80 images for training and 20 images for validation. This suggests that the criteria used to split the data was a simple 80-20 ratio, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for validation.

It is worth noting that there is no mention of a test set in the provided context, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after training and validation. The authors may have used the test zones (Test-Zone-1 and Test-Zone-2) for this purpose, but it is not clear from the provided context.

In general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and experiment. Common practices include using a random split, stratified split, or k-fold cross-validation. The choice of split ratio also depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem.
