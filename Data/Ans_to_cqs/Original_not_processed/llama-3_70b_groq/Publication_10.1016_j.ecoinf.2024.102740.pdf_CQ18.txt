Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples. This is mentioned in the context as "The RF generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset." This means that the model is evaluated on the samples that are not used for training, which helps to estimate the generalization error and monitor the model performance during training.
