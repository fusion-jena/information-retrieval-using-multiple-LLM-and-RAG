Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and provides information about the input variables, training time, prediction time, and hardware used. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement the CNN model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
