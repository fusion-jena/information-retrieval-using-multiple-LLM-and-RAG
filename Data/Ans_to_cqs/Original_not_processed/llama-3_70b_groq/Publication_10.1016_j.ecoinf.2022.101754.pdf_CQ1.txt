Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field surveys: Field data were collected during the vegetation season in July 2019 on 109 sample plots using Field-Map technology.
2. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data: LiDAR data were used in several studies, including estimating above-ground biomass and stem volume, distinguishing between live and dead standing tree biomass, and maximizing the efficiency of inventory plots in softwood plantations.
3. Landsat imagery: Landsat 8 data were used in combination with LiDAR data to estimate above-ground biomass.
4. Statistical forest inventory plots: Plots were placed within the study area in pairs with a distance of 50 m between paired plot centers.

It is likely that other methods, such as sensors, public datasets, and other remote sensing data, may also be used in deep learning pipelines for forest biomass estimation, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
