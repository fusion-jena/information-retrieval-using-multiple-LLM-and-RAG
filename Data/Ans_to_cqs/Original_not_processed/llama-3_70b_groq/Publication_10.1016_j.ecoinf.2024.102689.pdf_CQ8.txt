Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics such as imaging sonar for quantifying reef fish assemblages, machine translation using deep learning, biomass and abundance biases in European standard gillnet sampling, and object detection and segmentation datasets. It also mentions the use of PyTorch, Anaconda, and CUDA, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
