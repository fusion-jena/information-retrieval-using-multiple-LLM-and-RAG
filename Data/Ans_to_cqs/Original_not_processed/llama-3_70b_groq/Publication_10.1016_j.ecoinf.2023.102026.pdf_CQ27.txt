Answer:::

I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using random forests and generalized linear models, with discussions on bootstrapping and model validation. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
