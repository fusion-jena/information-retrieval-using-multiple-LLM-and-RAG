Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and support vector machines, and their applications in inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. It also mentions supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, but it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
