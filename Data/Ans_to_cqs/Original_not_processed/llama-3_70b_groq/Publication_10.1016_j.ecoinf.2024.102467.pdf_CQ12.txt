Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of EfficientNetV2, which is a series of lightweight convolutional neural networks. Additionally, the context mentions other CNN-related concepts, such as inverted residuals and linear bottlenecks (from MobilenetV2), squeeze-and-excitation networks, and bottleneck transformers for visual recognition. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the context, which suggests that the model is primarily based on CNNs.
