Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from public datasets and satellite imagery. Specifically, the table lists three datasets: GDP, NTL, and NPP, which are sourced from websites such as resdc.cn, tpdc.ac.cn, and earthdata.nasa.gov. These datasets seem to be related to economic, social, and ecological aspects of rural landscapes.

The context does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. Instead, it suggests that the data is obtained from existing datasets and satellite imagery. For instance, the paper by Moortgat et al. (2022) uses multispectral and panchromatic commercial satellite imagery for river classification.

It is possible that other methods, such as surveys or sensors, may be used in other deep learning pipelines, but based on the provided context, it appears that public datasets and satellite imagery are the primary sources of raw data.
