Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select representative training data subsets, and it mentions various machine learning models and approaches used for water quality prediction. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods specifically.

The only mention of overfitting is in the context of Artificial Neural Networks in the 2017 paper by Bilbao and Bilbao, which highlights the overfitting problem and over-training in the era of data. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
