Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to forest fires, land cover types, and above-ground biomass data, with discussions on research progress, fire severity, and data processing using Google Earth Engine (GEE). There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
