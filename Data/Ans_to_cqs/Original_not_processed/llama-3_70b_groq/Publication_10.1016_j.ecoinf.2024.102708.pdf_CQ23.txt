Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, data augmentation was performed on the training model, including varying lighting conditions, to ensure that the model represents seasonal or daily variations in the conditions. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset that captures different environmental conditions. Additionally, the model was tested on two different sites, Collapit Mudflat (Site A) and Scoble Point Rocky Shore (Site B), which implies that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance on different datasets. However, the exact details of the cross-validation or stratified splitting approach used are not specified in the provided context.
