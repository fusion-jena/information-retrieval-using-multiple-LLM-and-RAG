Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text discusses the challenges of data collection, the contribution of the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset, and the use of deep learning methods for individual identification. It also mentions data augmentation techniques, such as left-right mirroring, to reduce overfitting and strengthen the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
