Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the models, including the use of pre-trained weights, optimizers, and loss functions. It does not discuss randomness or strategies to handle it.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
