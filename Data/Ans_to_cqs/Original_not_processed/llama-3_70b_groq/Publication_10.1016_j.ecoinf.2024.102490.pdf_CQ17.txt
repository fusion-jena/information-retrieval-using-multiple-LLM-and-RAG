Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, climatic suitability, and statistical modeling techniques such as GLM, GAM, MARS, and MaxEnt. It does not provide information about deep learning or regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
