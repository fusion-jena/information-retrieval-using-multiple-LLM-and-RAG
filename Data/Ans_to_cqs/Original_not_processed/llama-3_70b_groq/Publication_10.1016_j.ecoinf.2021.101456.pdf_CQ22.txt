Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are ARI (Adjusted Rand Index) and AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information) scores. These metrics quantify the intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability of the clustering results. They are used to compare the performance of the dynamic Î²-VAE with the baselines in the clustering task.
