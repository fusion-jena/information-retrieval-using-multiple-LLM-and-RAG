Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, highlighting their differences in terms of computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. It does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps required for deep learning models.

However, it is well-known in the machine learning community that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential before training a deep learning model. These steps help to prepare the data, reduce the effect of outliers, and improve the model's performance. But, these details are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
