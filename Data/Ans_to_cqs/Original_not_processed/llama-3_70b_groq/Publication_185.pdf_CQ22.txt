Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "validation accuracy" in section 4.2.2, which suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it mentions the "recognition rate" for the family Hesperiidae, which could be related to precision or recall, but it is not clear.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of the AlexNet architecture and the Caffe framework, which typically involve evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, these metrics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, but we cannot determine the other metrics used without additional information.
