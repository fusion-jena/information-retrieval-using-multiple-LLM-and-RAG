Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the experiments, results, and methodology used for training and testing the model, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
