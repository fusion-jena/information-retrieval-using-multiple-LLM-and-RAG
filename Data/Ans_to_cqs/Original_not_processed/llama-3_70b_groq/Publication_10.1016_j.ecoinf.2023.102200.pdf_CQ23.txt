Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets of information related to LiDAR data, tree segmentation, and remote sensing, but it does not provide specific details about the development and evaluation of a deep learning model.

However, some of the references mentioned do discuss the use of techniques such as cross-validation and data augmentation to improve the generalizability of machine learning models. For example, the paper by Jin et al. (2018) mentions the use of data augmentation and cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model for individual maize segmentation.

Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this particular context.
