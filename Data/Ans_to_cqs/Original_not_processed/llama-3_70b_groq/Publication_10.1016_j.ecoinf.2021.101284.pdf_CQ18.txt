Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the analysis of factors related to the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland, including the use of machine learning models (MLR M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5) and the importance of considering environmental and air pollution data. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
