Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the development stage, where the data was divided into training, validation, and test sets, and various machine learning and deep learning models were constructed and hyper-parameter tuning was performed. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
