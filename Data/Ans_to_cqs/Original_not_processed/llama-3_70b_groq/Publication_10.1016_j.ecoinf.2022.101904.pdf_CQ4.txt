Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different transformer models (e.g., Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) and their performance in remote sensing image classification tasks. It also discusses the inclusion of CNN-based feature extractors and synthetic data to improve the classification accuracy of these models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
