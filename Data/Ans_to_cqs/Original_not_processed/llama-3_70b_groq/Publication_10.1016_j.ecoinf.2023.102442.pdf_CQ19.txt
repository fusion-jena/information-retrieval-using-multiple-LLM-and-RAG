Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, but it does not provide information about the deep learning framework used. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used to build the deep learning model.
