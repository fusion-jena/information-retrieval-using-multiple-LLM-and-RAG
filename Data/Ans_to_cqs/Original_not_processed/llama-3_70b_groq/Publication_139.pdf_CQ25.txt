Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for bird species classification from soundscape recordings. The model is trained to predict the presence of different bird species in audio recordings, and its performance is evaluated based on its classification accuracy. The model is also capable of handling multi-label data, where a single recording can contain multiple bird species, and it is considered correct if it predicts either or both of the labeled classes.
