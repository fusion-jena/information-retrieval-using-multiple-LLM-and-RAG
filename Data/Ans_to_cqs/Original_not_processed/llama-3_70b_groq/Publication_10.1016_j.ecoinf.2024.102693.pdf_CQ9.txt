Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models, such as CNN-like models, Transformer-like models, and their applications in computer vision tasks. It also provides tables comparing the performance of different models on a specific dataset. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
