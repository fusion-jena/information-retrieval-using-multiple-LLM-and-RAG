Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on weakly supervised learning tasks, specifically in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various terms used to describe weakly supervised learning tasks, such as weak labels, partial labels, and distribution learning. The context also introduces a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
