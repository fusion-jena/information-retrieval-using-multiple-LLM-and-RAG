Answer: 

The context provided does not mention a deep learning model, but rather discusses species distribution modeling and the evaluation of different correction methods for sampling bias effects. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are AUC, Denv, and Dgeo. 

AUC stands for Area Under the Curve, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Denv and Dgeo are not typical metrics used in deep learning, and their meanings are specific to the context of species distribution modeling. Denv and Dgeo are likely related to environmental and geographic factors, respectively, but their exact meanings are not defined in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
