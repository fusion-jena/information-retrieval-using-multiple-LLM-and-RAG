Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition, but it does not include any information about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
