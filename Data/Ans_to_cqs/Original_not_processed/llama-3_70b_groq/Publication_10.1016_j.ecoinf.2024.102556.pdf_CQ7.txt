Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is k-fold cross-validation. Specifically, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation, where each subset served as a validation set, and the remaining four subsets constituted the training set. This approach was used to address concerns about overfitting, the inability to assess the model's generalization ability, and uneven data distribution affecting prediction rates.
