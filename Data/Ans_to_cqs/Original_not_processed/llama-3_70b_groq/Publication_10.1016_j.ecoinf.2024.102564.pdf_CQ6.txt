Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only discusses the configuration of Random Forest (RF) training and the architecture of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
