Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, I can provide general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to address class imbalance and data bias in machine learning. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique to address data bias by collecting data from diverse sources, environments, and conditions to ensure that the model is robust and generalizable.

If you are looking for specific information on how to address data bias in the context of remote sensing or ecology, I would recommend searching for additional resources or consulting with experts in those fields.
