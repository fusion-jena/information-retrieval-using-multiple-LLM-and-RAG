Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context appears to be focused on various machine learning and signal processing techniques, including genetic programming, neural networks, support vector machines, and wavelet analysis, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
