Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The text discusses the performance of the WT-HMM model on different dataset sizes, its comparison with other studies, and the importance of dataset size in training robust models for cetacean vocalization classification. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
