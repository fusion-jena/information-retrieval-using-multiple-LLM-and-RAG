Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing hyper-parameters for each dataset, model development, and the challenges of creating and utilizing CNNs in bioacoustics research. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
