Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter fine-tuning results, the architecture of the CNN, and the overall workflow of preprocessing, network design, and prediction. It also discusses the limitations of deep learning and the importance of large and high-quality training data. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias.

That being said, the context does mention that the data (orthophoto and corresponding labels) were split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 Ã— 10,000 pixels). This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but it does not provide information on whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias.
