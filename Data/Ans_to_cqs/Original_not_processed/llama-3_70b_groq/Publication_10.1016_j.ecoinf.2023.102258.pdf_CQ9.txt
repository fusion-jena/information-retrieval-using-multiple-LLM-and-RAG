Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be related to a bioacoustic event detection challenge, and it discusses various methods and approaches used by different systems, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
