Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify environmental conditions (e.g., fog, glare) in terrestrial images. The model is trained on a dataset of images and is tasked with categorizing each image into one of six environmental condition classes. This is evident from the context, which mentions the validation performance of the CNN model with respect to each of the six environmental conditions and the confusion matrix in Fig. 7 (b).
