Answer:::

The context mentions that augmenting the training dataset using different techniques could be a potential strategy to mitigate the issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data. Specifically, it mentions the following data augmentation techniques:

* Adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions
* Shifting
* Rotating
* Adding noisy versions of the training images
* Using different brightness levels

However, it does not explicitly state that these techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only suggests them as potential strategies. Therefore, we cannot confirm which specific data augmentation techniques were applied in the pipeline.

It is worth noting that the provided table (Table 1) lists the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, but it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques.
