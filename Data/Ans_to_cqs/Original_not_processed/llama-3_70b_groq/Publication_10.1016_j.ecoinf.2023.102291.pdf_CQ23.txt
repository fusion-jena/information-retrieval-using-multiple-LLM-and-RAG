Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the training process, and the hyperparameters used. It does mention that the model was trained on a dataset comprising 3900 images, but it does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or any techniques used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
