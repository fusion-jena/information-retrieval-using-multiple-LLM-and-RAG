Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses various aspects of the model, such as modifying the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and strategies for variance reduction, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available.
