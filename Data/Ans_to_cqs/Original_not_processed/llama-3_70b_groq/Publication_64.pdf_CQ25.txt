Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically plant classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions "plant classification" as the task and uses a ResNet model, which is a convolutional neural network architecture commonly used for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of images of plants and is expected to classify them into different species or categories.
