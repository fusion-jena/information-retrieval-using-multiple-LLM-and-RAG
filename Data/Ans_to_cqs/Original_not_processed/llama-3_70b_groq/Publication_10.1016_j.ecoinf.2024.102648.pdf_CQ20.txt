Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models, including artificial neural networks, bootstrap forest, and boosted tree, for predicting the percent disease incidence of CLCuD. It also provides information on the variables used in the models, such as weather parameters and whitefly count, and presents results from the models, including variable importance analysis. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the models, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
