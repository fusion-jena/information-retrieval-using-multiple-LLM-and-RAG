Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only mentions the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model and its application in the automated framework for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations. It does not provide information about the underlying framework used to build the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
