Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the application of deep neural networks for fish biomass estimation, comparing the performance of different models (DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n), and discussing the importance of high-quality target detection in the underwater environment. It does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
