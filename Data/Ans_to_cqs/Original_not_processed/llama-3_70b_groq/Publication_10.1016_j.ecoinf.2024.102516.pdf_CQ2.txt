Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the mention of image resolution (1536 Ã— 768 pixels) in the training phase, and the use of ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale visual recognition challenge. Additionally, the context mentions data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in image processing. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
