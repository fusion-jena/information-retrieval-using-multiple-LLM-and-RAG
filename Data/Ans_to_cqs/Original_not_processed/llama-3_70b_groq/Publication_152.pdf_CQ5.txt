Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net for image classification and object detection tasks, specifically for identifying invasive vegetation species (Heidychium Coronarium) in the Brazilian natural flora. The dataset used in this work is a custom dataset collected using a DJI Phantom 2 drone, which is not a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
