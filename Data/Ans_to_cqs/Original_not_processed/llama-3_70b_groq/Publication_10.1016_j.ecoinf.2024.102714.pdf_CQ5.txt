Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used are derived from various field datasets and Very High Resolution (VHR) images. The specific datasets used include:

* Seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 (S2)
* Backscatter composites from Sentinel-1 (S1)
* Elevation and slope data derived from multiple LIDAR flights between 2006 and 2015
* Additional contextual datasets such as:
	+ Peat depth map
	+ Phase-1 map
	+ Saltmarsh layer
	+ Mean High Water Spring Tides
	+ National Forest Inventory Data

These datasets are used as input features for the XGBoostClassifier, totaling up to 54 features. The datasets are split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels reserved for independent model validation.
