Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on object detection using convolutional neural networks, specifically YoloV3, and discusses the creation of a custom dataset for the project due to a lack of existing quality data. It also mentions the challenges of labeling data, particularly in complex situations with multiple objects.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset created for the project might have involved collecting raw data through some means, possibly related to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, given the mention of "ocean objects" and "SAR" in the keywords. Nevertheless, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
