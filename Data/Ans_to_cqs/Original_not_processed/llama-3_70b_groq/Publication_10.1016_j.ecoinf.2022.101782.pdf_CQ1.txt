Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data is collected from social media posts, specifically from Flickr, as the context mentions "social media data" and "Flickr users" in the discussion section.

It appears that the raw data is collected from citizen science data and social media posts related to a specific species, in this case, red kites (Milvus milvus). The context does not mention surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Instead, it focuses on leveraging citizen science data to extract relevant records from social media posts.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the method utilized for collecting raw data is social media posts, specifically from Flickr, and citizen science data.
