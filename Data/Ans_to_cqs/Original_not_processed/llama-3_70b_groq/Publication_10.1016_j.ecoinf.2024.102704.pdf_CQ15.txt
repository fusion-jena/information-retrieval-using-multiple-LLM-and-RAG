Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does discuss various techniques to optimize model performance, particularly in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

One technique mentioned is reconfiguring the computation sequence of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation layers to reduce memory access, which can lead to increased computational efficiency. Another approach is to reduce the number of layers in the network model, which can lower the number of convolutions and data required, thereby accelerating operations.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of depthwise separable convolution neural networks, which can be used for high-speed object detection. It also discusses the importance of model lightweighting and inference speed, which can be achieved by reducing the number of parameters in the model. However, the context notes that simply reducing the number of parameters does not necessarily enhance processing speed.

While the context provides insights into optimizing model performance, it does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
