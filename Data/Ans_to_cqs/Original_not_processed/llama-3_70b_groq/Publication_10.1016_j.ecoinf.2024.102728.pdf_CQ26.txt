Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, vegetation, and ecology, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

However, it's worth noting that the context mentions "Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry" in the first reference, which suggests that the authors are aware of the concept of inductive bias in deep learning models. Inductive bias refers to the assumptions made by a model about the data it is trained on, which can lead to biased results.

To answer the query, I would need more information or context about the specific deep learning pipeline and the type of data being used. The techniques used to address data bias can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

In general, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which technique is most suitable.
