Answer:::
The context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be numerical or tabular data, such as CSV, since the study involves estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices using water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data as inputs to the CNN model. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
