Answer:::

I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or performance monitoring. The context appears to be related to a study on animal vocalizations, specifically tracking and analyzing song structures. The table provided shows the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set. The references cited are also related to animal tracking and acoustic monitoring, but do not mention model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
