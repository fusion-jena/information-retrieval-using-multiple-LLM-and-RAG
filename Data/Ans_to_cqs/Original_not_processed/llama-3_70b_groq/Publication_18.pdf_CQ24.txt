Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep neural networks, including image classification, object detection, and image super-resolution, as well as techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the learning process.

However, it is worth noting that randomness can be handled in deep learning pipelines by setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results. This is a common practice in many deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, techniques like ensemble methods and Bayesian neural networks can be used to handle uncertainty and randomness in deep learning models.

Since the provided context does not provide specific information on handling randomness, I couldn't find a direct answer to the query.
