Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, and the HyperBand algorithm for optimization. It discusses the hyperparameters for CNN window size and the number of filters, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
