Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the dataset is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set consists of 22,666 images, the validation set consists of 7554 images, and the testing set also consists of 7554 images. The exact criteria or ratio used to split the data into these sets are not mentioned. Typically, in deep learning, the data is split into these sets to prevent overfitting, where the model is trained on the training set, tuned on the validation set, and evaluated on the testing set. However, without further information, the specific criteria used in this case cannot be determined.
