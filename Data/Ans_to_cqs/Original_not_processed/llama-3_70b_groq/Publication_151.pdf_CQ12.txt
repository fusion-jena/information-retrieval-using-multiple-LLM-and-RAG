Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, which states "training the CNN model" and explains the architecture of the CNN model, including the use of convolutional layers to capture k-mer signatures.
