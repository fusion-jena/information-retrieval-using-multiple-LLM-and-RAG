Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses predicted intensity maps, lasso regularization, bias correction, and penalized regression techniques, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
