Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This is mentioned in the abstract, where it is stated that the study aims to classify land use and land cover for the Talassemtane National Park using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. 

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. The focus is on processing and analyzing large Remote Sensing (RS) datasets using cloud-based computing techniques and machine-learning algorithms.
