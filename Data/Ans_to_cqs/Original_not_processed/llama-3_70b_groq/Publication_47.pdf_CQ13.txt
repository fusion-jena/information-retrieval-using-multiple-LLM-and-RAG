Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or number of epochs. The text only describes the architecture of the neural network, the features used, and the training process, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
