Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a research article about land use/land cover classification using Random Forest, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. It discusses the dataset, spectral indices, and classification methodology, but it does not mention grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization technique. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
