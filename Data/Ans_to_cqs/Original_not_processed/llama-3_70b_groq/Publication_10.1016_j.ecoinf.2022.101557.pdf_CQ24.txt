Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or any specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is trained with a dropout rate of 0.3, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This can be seen as a way to introduce randomness in the model to improve its generalization capabilities.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data is split into several larger blocks depending on coordinates for cross-validation purposes. This could be seen as a way to handle randomness in the data by ensuring that the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data.

However, it does not provide any information about the use of a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that any specific strategy is employed to handle randomness in the pipeline.
