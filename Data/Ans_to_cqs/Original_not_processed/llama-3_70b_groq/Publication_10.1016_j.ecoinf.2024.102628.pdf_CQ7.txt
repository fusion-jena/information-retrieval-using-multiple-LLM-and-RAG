Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is the Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach. In this approach, each multitemporal transect is used once as a test set while the remaining transects are used for training. This means that the data is split into training and testing sets based on the multitemporal transects, with one transect being held out for testing and the rest used for training in each iteration. This approach is used to ensure that there is no information transfer or contamination from previous folds, and to account for the lack of independence in the multitemporal data.
