Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, LSTM neural networks, and their application to carbon emission forecasting. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters, the architecture of LSTM models, and the optimization process, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
