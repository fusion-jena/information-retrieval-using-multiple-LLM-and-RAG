Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses the performance of a model in classifying maturity stages of fish, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. It mentions the use of Random Forests, a machine learning technique, but does not elaborate on the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
