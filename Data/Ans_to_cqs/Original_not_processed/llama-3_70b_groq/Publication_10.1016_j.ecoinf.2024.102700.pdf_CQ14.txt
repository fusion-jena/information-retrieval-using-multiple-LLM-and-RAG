Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the literature search strategy, eligibility criteria, and model results, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. It does not mention specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
