Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of K-Folds cross-validation. This is evident from Tables A.5 and A.6, which show the confusion matrices for RapidEye and Landsat imagery using Random Forest, respectively. Each row in the tables represents an iteration of the 5 K-Folds used, with values only being used on the bags excluded from training. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated on a separate subset of the data (20% of the total data) that was not used for training the algorithm. This approach helps to estimate how well the model will perform on new, unseen data and provides a more accurate assessment of its performance.
