Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a research article on predicting the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls using machine learning ensemble predictions and geographic information systems (GIS). It provides information on the data used, model diagnostics, and references to other research papers, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
