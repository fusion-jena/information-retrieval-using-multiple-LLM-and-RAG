Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics related to camera traps, species identification, and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
