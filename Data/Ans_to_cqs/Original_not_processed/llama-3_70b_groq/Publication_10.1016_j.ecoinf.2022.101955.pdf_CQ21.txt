Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model performance, LULC mapping, and the parameterization settings for each of the four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF). It discusses the model architectures, tuning parameters, and training processes, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
