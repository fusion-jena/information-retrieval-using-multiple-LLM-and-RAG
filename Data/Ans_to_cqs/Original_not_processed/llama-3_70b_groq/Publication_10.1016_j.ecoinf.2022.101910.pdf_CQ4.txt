Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, but it does not provide details on the data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
