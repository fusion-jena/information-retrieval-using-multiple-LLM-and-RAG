Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on convolutional neural networks, model training, and various neural network architectures such as DenseNet, MobileNet, and AlexNet. It discusses model parameters, activation functions, and training procedures, but does not touch on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
