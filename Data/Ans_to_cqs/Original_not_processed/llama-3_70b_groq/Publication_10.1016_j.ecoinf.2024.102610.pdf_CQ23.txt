Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that spatial cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the model. This is mentioned in section 2.3.2, which refers to "spatial cross-validation, model training, and spatial mapping". However, there is no explicit mention of other measures such as diverse datasets, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure generalizability. 

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the creation of a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for the trained model, which might be related to ensuring generalizability, but the exact purpose and methodology are not clear. 

In summary, spatial cross-validation was used, but the context does not provide information on other measures taken to ensure generalizability.
