Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, their advantages, and performance evaluation metrics like RMSE, Adjusted R2, MSE, AIC, and BIC. It also describes the structure of the BP-ANN model used and the process of selecting hidden layers and neurons through trial and error.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to use various stopping criteria to determine when training is complete, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, indicating that the model has converged.
2. Maximum number of epochs: Training is stopped after a specified number of epochs, regardless of the validation loss.
3. Early stopping: Training is stopped when the validation loss starts increasing, indicating overfitting.

These criteria are not mentioned in the provided context, so I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given information.
