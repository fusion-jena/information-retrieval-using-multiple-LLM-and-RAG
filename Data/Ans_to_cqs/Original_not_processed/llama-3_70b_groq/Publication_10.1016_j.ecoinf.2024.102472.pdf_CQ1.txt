Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing and Landsat 8 OLI data, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is one of the sources of raw data used in the pipeline. Additionally, the mention of Sentinel-2 data in one of the references suggests that this might also be a source of raw data. 

It is also possible that the raw data is collected through field measurements or surveys, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. There is no mention of public datasets or sensors being used for data collection. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that satellite imagery, specifically Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 data, is one of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is unclear if other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets are also used.
