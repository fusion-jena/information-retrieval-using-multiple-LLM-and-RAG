Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNNFAST network, its application to bat acoustic signal detection, and references to other research papers on deep learning for audio classification and speech recognition. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
