Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and word frequency counting, as well as word embedding techniques like Word2vec. 

However, it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
