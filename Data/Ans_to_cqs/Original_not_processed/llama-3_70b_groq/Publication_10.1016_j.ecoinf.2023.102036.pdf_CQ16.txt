Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard, a set of visualization tools, and that the model was validated every 300 iterations. This suggests that the training process was monitored and validated regularly, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified. It is possible that the training was stopped after a certain number of iterations (3000 in this case) or when the model's performance on the validation set reached a certain threshold, but this is not explicitly stated.
