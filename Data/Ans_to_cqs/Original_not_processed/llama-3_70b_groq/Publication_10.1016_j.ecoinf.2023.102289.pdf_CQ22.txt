Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It discusses the functionality of LaDeco, a platform that uses a pre-trained model (deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269) for semantic segmentation, and provides details on loading the model, setting a threshold, and output format. It also mentions the computational efficiency and the overall architecture of the platform. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model.
