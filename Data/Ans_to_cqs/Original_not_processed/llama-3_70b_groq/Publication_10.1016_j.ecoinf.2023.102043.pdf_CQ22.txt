Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context provides a confusion matrix (Table 1) that shows the predicted classes against the actual classes, but it does not provide the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. 

However, based on the confusion matrix, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, as the highest rates are emboldened in the table. But without explicit mention, it is difficult to determine if other metrics are also being used.
