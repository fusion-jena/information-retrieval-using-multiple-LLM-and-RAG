Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of accuracy and misclassification rates, as well as the generation of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heat maps. These heat maps are used to visualize the morphological characters of the training set used by the classifier in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily levels of taxonomic identification. The percentages provided in the figure legend indicate the proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classification in the training set.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned. Metrics calculation is implied through the provision of accuracy and misclassification rates, but the specific metrics used are not detailed.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training appear to include Grad-CAM heat map generation and accuracy/misclassification rate calculation, but the context does not provide information on saliency maps or confusion matrices.
