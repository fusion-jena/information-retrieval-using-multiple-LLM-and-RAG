Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the fine-tuning process, model architecture, and technical aspects of the model, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of pre-trained weights obtained from the 'imagenet' dataset, which implies that the input data might have undergone some form of preprocessing before being used to train the pre-trained model. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial in deep learning, as they can significantly impact the model's performance. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
