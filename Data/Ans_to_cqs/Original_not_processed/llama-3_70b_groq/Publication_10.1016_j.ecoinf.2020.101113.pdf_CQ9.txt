Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the model training, data preprocessing, and challenges faced during the study, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
