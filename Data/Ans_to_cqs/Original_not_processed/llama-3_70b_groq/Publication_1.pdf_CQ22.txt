Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The paper discusses the application of deep learning for large-scale biodiversity monitoring, the types of data used (audio and image streams), and the data collection process. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
