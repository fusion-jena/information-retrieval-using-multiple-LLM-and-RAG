Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a specific platform where the deep learning pipeline data is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the performance of different machine learning models on various datasets, but it does not provide information about the availability of the data or the pipeline used. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
