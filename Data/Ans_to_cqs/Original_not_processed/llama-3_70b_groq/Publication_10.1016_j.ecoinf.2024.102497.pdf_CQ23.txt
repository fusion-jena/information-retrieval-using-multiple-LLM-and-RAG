Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It discusses the use of linear regression, artificial neural network-based cellular automata, CART, and RFR models for bathymetry retrieval. Therefore, it does not provide information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does mention the use of cross-validation to optimize the CART model. Specifically, it states that the parameter values for the CART model were selected to "prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model." This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the CART model and prevent overfitting.

No information is provided on the use of diverse datasets, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure the generalizability of the models.
