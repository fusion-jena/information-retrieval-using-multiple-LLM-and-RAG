Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a passage from a research paper discussing the effects of human activities on vegetation coverage in China, specifically in the context of the Grain-for-Green program. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so it is not possible to determine where the code repository is available.
