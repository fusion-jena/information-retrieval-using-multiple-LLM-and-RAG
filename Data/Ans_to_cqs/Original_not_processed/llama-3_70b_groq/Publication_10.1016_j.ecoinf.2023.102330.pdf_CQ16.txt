Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is related to convergence, which is supported by statistics with values less than 1.05. Additionally, an adaptive phase of 2000 iterations and three Markov chains each of length 20,000 were used to ensure convergence, along with a burn-in period of 5000. However, there is no explicit mention of validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining when training is complete.
