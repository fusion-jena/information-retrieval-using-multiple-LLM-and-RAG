Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context provides information about the models used (AlexNet, ResNet, MobileNet), the environment and computational resources used, and the model training parameters, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
