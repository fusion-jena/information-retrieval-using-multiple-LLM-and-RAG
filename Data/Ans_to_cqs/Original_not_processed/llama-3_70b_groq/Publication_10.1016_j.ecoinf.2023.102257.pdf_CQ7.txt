Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing the use of machine learning (ML) bounding boxes to assist in data labeling for trail camera imagery, and evaluating the effects of ML model performance on tagging efficiency. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
