Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a NASA web service API, discussing methods for retrieving data from the NASA server, such as execute_all, execute_many, and their asynchronous versions. It also mentions memory management and data ingestion operations, but it does not provide any information about machine learning model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
