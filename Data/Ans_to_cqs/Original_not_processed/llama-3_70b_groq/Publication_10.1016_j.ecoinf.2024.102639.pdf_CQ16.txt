Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation to refine hyperparameters and ascertain the configuration that minimizes cross-validation error, thereby enhancing model precision. This suggests that the training process may be monitored and stopped when the cross-validation error reaches a minimum or plateaus. Additionally, the context mentions the use of grid search and cross-validation to calibrate hyperparameters, which may also be used to determine when training is complete. However, a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau is not explicitly mentioned.
