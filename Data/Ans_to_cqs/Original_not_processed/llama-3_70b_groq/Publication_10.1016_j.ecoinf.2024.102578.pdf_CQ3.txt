Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that human annotators are needed for reviewing computer vision results, and that a semi-automated workflow is proposed that includes manual quality checks and final data formatting. It does not provide details on the annotation techniques used to prepare the data for the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
