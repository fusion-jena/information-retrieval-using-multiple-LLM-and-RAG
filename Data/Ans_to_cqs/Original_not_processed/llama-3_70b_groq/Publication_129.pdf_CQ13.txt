Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned in the provided context. Specifically, the training hyperparameters of Faster R-CNN are carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests. The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum value of 0.9. The initial value of the learning rate is set to 0.001 and decreases to 0.0004 after 40 K steps.
