Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search or random search. However, it does mention the use of search algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize model parameters, such as the number of neurons in neural networks and error penalty factor in SVM. Additionally, it mentions the use of other optimization algorithms like the multi-verse optimizer for parameter optimization. It does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters are optimized, but it suggests that optimization algorithms are used to find the best combination of parameters for the models.
