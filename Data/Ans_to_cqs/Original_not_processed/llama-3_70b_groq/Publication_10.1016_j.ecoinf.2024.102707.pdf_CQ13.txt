Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the authors tried many different sets of hyperparameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements, and therefore decided to use the default settings. However, the default settings are not specified.
