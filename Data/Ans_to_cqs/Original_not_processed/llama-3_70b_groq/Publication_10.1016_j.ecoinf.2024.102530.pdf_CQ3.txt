The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a study on beekeeping suitability mapping using various datasets and expert knowledge. It discusses the use of different data types, such as Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), weather data, and parcel data, but does not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
