Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. The section 3.3 "Post-processing of output" only mentions "Spatial patterns within seagrass meadow ecosystem" as a subtopic, but it does not provide any information about the specific post-processing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It is possible that the post-processing steps are not mentioned in the given text, or they might be discussed in a different section or document.
