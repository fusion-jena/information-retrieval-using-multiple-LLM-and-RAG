Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter fine-tuning results, evaluation metrics, and the architecture of the U-net model. It does mention that the experiments were "validated on the validation portion of the dataset," but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
