Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for covey call detection and its integration with the ARU DS model for density estimation. It discusses the data augmentation process, the modeling of detection probabilities, and the use of informative priors for certain parameters. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during the training of the CNN. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
