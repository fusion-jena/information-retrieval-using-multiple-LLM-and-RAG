Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps.

However, based on general knowledge, common postprocessing steps involved after model training may include:

* Saliency maps: to visualize the importance of input features
* Metrics calculation: to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* Confusion matrix: to visualize the performance of the model on a test dataset
* Hyperparameter tuning: to optimize the model's performance by adjusting hyperparameters
* Model interpretation: to understand how the model is making predictions
* Model validation: to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps, and the specific steps involved may vary depending on the model, dataset, and problem being addressed.
