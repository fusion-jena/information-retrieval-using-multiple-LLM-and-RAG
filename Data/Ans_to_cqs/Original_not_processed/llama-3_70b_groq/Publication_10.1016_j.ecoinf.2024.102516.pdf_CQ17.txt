Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the training process, data augmentation, and comparison with a baseline model, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
