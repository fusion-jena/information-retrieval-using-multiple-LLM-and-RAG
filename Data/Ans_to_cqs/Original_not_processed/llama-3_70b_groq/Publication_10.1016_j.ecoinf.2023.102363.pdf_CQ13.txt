Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 0.001 (during training) and 0.0004 (during fine-tuning)
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Decay factor: 0.75
* Step size: Not specified
* Dropout rate: 0.2 (during fine-tuning)
* DropConnect: Employed during fine-tuning

These hyperparameters are mentioned in the provided context, specifically in the sections describing the training and fine-tuning of the model.
