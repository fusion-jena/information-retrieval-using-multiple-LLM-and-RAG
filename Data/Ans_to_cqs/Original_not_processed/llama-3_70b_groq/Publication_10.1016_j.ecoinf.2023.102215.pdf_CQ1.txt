Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and design of convolutional neural networks, specifically the U2-Net model, and its applications in image segmentation and feature extraction. It discusses the use of dilated convolutions, receptive fields, and encoder-decoder structures, but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
