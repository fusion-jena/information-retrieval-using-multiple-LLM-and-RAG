Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual inspection by two trained graduate students into a set of sound categories. This suggests that the annotation technique used is some form of manual labeling or classification of spectrogram images into different sound categories. The context does not provide further details on the specific annotation technique used.
