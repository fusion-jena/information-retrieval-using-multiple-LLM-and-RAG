Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on different deep learning architectures, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, and their performance on image recognition tasks. It also mentions various papers and research related to deep learning, but does not provide information on optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
