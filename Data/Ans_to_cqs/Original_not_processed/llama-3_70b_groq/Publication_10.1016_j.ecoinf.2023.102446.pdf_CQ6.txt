Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecology and carbon uptake by vegetation, discussing concepts such as Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Ecosystem Respiration (RE), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE). There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
