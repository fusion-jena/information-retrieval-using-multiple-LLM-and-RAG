Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, stochastic gradient descent, and supervised learning, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the models are trained using a supervised approach, where the learning algorithm is told what the desired output is for each input data sample. This suggests that the model performance might be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or loss, which are commonly used in supervised learning. However, this is only an inference, and the actual strategy used to monitor model performance during training is not specified in the provided context.

In summary, the answer to this query is that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
