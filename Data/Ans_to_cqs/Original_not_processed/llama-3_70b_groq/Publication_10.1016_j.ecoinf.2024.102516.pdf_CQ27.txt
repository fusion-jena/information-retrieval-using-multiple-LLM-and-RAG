Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the segmentation pre-training approach, transfer learning, and the network setup for investigations. It also compares the results with a baseline model and provides details on the network architecture and hyperparameters used during training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
