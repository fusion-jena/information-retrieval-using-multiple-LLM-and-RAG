Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a specific platform where the deep learning pipeline data is stored or shared. The context primarily focuses on the machine learning models, their optimization, and performance evaluation. It does not provide information about data storage or sharing. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
