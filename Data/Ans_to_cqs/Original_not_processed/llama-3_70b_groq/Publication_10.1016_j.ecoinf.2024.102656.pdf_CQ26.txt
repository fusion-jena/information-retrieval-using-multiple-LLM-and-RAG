Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, habitat suitability analysis, and landscape resistance modeling, using statistical models such as generalized linear models, maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting models, and multivariate adaptive regression lines. The context discusses model evaluation metrics, such as area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS), but does not mention deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.
