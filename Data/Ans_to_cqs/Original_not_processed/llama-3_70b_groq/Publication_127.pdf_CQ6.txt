Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers and architectures related to deep learning, such as sequence-to-sequence learning, image recognition, and speech recognition. It also provides a table comparing the performance of different deep learning architectures.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.
* Normalization: Scaling the input features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: Transforming the input features to a specific range, such as standardization or feature scaling, to improve the model's performance.
* Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the raw data, such as resizing images or extracting spectrograms from audio signals.
* Data augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping, to the input data.

Please note that these preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are common practices in deep learning.
