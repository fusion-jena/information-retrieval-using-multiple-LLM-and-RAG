Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the procedure for building models, including data preparation, scale optimization, and model training. It does mention that the trained models are evaluated using the evaluation dataset, with metrics such as AUC and TSS being calculated. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
