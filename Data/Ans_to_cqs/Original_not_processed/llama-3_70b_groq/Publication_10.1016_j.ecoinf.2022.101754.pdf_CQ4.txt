Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning methods for estimating above-ground biomass in forests, with a focus on the preprocessing of LiDAR data and the comparison of different regression models. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques.
