Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the neural network are Intersection over Union (IoU) and Accuracy. 

The IoU metric is a custom implementation that computes the intersection of the reference dataset and the predicted classification, divided by the union of the two. The formula for IoU is given as:

IoU = TP / (TP + FP + FN)

where TP, TN, FP, and FN are true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively.

The Accuracy metric is also used, which is calculated as:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)

These metrics are used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model during the training process.
