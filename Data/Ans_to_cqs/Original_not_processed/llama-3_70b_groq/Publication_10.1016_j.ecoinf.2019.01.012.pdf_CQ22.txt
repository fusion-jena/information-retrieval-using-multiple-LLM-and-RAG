Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1 score (F1), and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated based on the loss, which serves as a measure of how far the model predictions differ from the actual class.
