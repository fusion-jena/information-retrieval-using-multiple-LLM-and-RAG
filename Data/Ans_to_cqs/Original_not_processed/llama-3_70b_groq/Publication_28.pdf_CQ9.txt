Answer::: 

The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available. According to the data availability statement, "Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study." This implies that there is no dataset or data repository associated with this study. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the data can be accessed.
