Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using a performance metric Φ(M, D) or Φ(Smanual, D) on the dataset D. This metric is used to compare the performance of different hyperparameter configurations and select the best one. The context also mentions that the models are evaluated using a 60:40 split of training and testing data, and the performance metrics such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are reported. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned.
