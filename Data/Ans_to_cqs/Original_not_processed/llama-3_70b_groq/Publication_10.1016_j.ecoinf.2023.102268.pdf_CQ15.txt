Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the use of ResNet-50, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a cubic polynomial kernel. It also mentions 10-fold cross-validation for model selection and parameter optimization, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
