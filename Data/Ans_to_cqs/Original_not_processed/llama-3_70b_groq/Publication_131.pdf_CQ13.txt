Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only describes the architecture of the CNN, including the number of filters per convolution layer, kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. It also discusses the training and testing strategy, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
