Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the tuning of hyperparameters using a grid search method, the training process of artificial neural networks, and the selection of optimal predictor variables. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

In the context of artificial neural networks, it is common to use techniques such as validation curves, learning curves, or early stopping to monitor the model's performance during training. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training based on the provided context.
