Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the learning rate, number of training epochs, and batch size used in the training process, but it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized. It is possible that the authors used a specific optimization technique, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided information.
