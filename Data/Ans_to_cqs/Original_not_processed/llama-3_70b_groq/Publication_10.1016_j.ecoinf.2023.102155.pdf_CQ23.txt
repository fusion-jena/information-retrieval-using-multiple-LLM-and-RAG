Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses various methods such as k-NN, k-means, and random CF Loop A Loop T Loop E, as well as the use of the ppmlasso package. It also mentions bias correction and provides information on the arguments of certain functions. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or measures to ensure their generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
