Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various deep learning models and architectures, such as Faster R-CNN, FCRN, and others, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training.
