Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of convolution kernels, feature maps, and receptive fields in the context. The context also mentions the use of a backbone network, which is a common term used in CNN architectures. Additionally, the context discusses feature pyramid networks, path aggregation networks, and bidirectional feature pyramid networks, which are all variants of CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
