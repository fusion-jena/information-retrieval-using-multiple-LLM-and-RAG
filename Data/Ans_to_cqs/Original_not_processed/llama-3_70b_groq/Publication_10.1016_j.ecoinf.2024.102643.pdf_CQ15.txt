Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to a study on predicting range shifts of African apes under global change scenarios, and it discusses various statistical models and techniques used in the study, such as Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and others. However, it does not provide information on deep learning or optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
