Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various deep learning architectures such as ResNet, AlexNet, DenseNet, and DeepLab, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
