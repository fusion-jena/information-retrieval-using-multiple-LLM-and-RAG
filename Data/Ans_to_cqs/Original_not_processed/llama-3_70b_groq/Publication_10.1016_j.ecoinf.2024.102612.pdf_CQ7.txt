Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the methodology used for fuel model retrieval, the performance evaluation of the SoftGroup semantic branch, and the training process of the deep learning model. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
