Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context mentions various machine learning and deep learning models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
