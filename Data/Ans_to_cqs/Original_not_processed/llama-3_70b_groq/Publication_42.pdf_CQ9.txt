Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the performance of different CNN architectures, transfer learning, and the challenges of collecting a sufficient dataset for training and validation. However, it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
