Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data augmentation strategies and patching techniques used during the training phase.

Specifically, the context states that during the training stage, square patches of various sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels) are randomly cropped from the images, and a simple augmentation strategy is applied, which involves flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images contain contaminants such as dust, fluff, or leaves, which are accidentally glued over the sticky traps. However, it does not specify any preprocessing steps to remove or handle these contaminants.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of data augmentation is involved, but the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned.
