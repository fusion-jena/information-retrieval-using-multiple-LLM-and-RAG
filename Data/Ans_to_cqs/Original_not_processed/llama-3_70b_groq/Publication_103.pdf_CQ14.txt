Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the results of experiments with different pre-trained models and fine-tuning strategies, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
