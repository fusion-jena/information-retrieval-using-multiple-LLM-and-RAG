Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on wetlands, wetland use intensity, and ecosystem health in East Africa, using earth observation data from Sentinel-2. It mentions a dataset, plot locations, and a table, but does not provide information on how the data was split for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
