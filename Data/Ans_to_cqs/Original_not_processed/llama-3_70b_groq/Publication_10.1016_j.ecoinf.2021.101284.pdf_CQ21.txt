Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing step, specifically standardization, and discusses the different models (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5) used to analyze the dependencies. It also presents the W* parameters values for each model in figures 10, 11, and 12. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
