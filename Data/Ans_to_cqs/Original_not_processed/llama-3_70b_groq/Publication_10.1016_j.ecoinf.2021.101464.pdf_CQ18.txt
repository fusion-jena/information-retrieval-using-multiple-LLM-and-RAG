Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored through the use of out-of-bag (OOB) error rate and 10-fold cross-validation.

The OOB error rate was used to determine the optimal number of variables to try (M) in the Random Forest model. The TuneRF function was used to find the value of M that resulted in the minimum OOB error rate.

Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. The results of the cross-validation are shown in Table 5, which provides the RMSE and R2 values for each fold. The average R2 and RMSE values were calculated to assess the model's overall performance.

While the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the OOB error rate and 10-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate and optimize the model's performance.
