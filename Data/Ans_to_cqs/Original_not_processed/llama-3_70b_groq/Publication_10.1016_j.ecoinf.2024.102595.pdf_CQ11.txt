Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of oil palm yield prediction, the use of machine learning and deep learning models, and the analysis of 17 models using a robust agronomy dataset. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the data repository.
