Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be focused on audio signal processing, ecoacoustic indices, and mitigating device biases in site comparisons. It mentions the use of different recording devices such as SongMeter and AudioMoth, but it does not provide information about the training of a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
