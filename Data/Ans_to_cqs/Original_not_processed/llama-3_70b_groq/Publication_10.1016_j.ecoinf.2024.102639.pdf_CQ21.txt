Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the model training process, including the selection of the distance metric, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning for the SVM model. It also discusses the analytical solution of the decision-making model and provides mathematical theorems and corollaries to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions.

However, it can be inferred that the model training process is followed by some form of evaluation or validation, as the text mentions "cross-validation error" and "explained variance ratio." These metrics suggest that the model's performance is being evaluated, but the specific postprocessing steps are not detailed.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
