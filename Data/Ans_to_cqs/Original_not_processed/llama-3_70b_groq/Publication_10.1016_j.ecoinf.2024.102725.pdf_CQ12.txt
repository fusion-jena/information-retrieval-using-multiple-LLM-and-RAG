Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. While it mentions "deep-learning enhanced fusion methods" and "fusion of optical and SAR images based on deep learning", it does not specify the type of deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
