Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the use of Maxent, a machine learning technique, and deep learning strategies such as neural networks, but it does not provide details on the regularization methods used.

However, it does mention the concept of "regularisation multiplier" in the context of Maxent, which suggests that regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting. But the specific methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
