Answer: The context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "The performance is averaged over 10 random seeds." This suggests that the authors are using a technique called "seed averaging" to handle randomness. This involves training the model multiple times with different random seed values and averaging the results to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
