Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that hyperspectral imagery is used as a data source, as mentioned in the paper by Hong et al. (2022) that estimates cyanobacteria pigments in rivers using spatial attention convolutional neural networks with hyperspectral imagery.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat satellite data, as referenced in the paper by Irons et al. (2012), which discusses the Landsat Data Continuity Mission. This suggests that remote sensing data from satellites may be used as a source of raw data.

It can also be inferred that water quality parameters are used as input features, as mentioned in the context, but the method of collecting these parameters is not specified. It may involve surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but this is not explicitly stated.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that hyperspectral imagery and remote sensing data from satellites may be used as sources of raw data. However, the exact methods of collecting water quality parameters are not specified.
