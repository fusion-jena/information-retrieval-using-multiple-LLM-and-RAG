Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the networks was assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, which were computed at both micro and macro levels. The context also mentions that the performances of different ResNet architectures were compared on validation and test sets, suggesting that the model performance was monitored and evaluated on these sets during training. Additionally, the use of a grid search tool implemented in scikit-learn for optimizing the learning rate (LR) on the validation set implies that the model performance was monitored and tuned during training. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated.
