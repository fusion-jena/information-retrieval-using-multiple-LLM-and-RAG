Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on describing the augmentation strategies, model architectures, and training times for various deep learning models, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
