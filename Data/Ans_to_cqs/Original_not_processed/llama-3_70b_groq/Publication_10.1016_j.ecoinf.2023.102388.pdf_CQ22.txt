Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "discrimination accuracy" in Table 7, which suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the context mentions "loss and accuracy" in the description of the contrastive loss function used in the Siamese Neural Network (SNN) model, which implies that accuracy is being used as a performance metric. 

However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, but we cannot determine the other metrics used.
