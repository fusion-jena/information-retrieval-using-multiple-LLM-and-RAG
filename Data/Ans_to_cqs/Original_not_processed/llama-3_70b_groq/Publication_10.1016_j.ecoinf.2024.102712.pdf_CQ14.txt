Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only mentions that the explanatory variables were selected using regsubsets in the R package leaps (Lumley and Lumley, 2013) and the best model was selected based on the adjusted R2. It does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were tuned or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
