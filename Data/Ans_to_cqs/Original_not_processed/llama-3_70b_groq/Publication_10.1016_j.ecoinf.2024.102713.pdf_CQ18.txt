Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or performance monitoring. It appears to describe a system called CASE, which is used for data collection and analysis, but it does not provide information about machine learning models or their training. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training based on the given context.
