Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the validation set is used during training for the fine-tuning of hyperparameters and model selection, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
