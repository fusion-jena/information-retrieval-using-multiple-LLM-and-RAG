Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on object detection algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and EfficientDet, and their architectures. It also discusses feature fusion approaches, including unbounded fusion, softmax-based fusion, and fast normalized fusion. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning and may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature engineering. These steps help prepare the data for training and can significantly impact the model's performance. However, without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in the context, and further information would be required to provide a more accurate answer.
