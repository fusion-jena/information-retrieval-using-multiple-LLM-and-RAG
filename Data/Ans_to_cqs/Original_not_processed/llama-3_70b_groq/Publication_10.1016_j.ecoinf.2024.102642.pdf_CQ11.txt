Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the Ple de Calcul et de Donn√©es Marines (PCDM) as providing storage, data access, computational resources, visualization, web-services, consultation, and support services, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Additionally, it does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, which are common data repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the data repository.
