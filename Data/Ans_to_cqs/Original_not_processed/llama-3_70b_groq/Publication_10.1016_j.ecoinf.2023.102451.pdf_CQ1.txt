Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms EMDS-6 is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. This suggests that the raw data is collected from a pre-existing dataset, rather than through methods such as surveys or sensors. The context does not provide further information on how the EMDS-6 dataset was originally collected.
