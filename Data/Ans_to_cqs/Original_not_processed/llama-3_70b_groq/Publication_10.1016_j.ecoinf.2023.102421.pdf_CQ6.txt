Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context only mentions that the workflow starts with collecting sample plots and image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, including on-field AGB and independent features. However, it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.
