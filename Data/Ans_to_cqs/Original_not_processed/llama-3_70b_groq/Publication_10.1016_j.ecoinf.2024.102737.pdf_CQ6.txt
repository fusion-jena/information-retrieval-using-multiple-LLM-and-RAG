Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way to achieve better results. It also references face preprocessing adjustment methods, such as "one-to-many augmentation" and "many-to-one normalization", which are used to handle pose variability in face recognition.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images in the training and test sets varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast and brightness. However, it does not specify how these variations were handled or what preprocessing steps were applied to the images.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
