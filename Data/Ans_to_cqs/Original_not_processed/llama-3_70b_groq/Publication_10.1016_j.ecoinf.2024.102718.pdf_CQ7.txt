Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data is split into training, testing, and validation sets, but the exact criteria used for this split are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that "80% of the dataset is used for training and validation purposes, and the remaining 20% are used for testing and validation." This suggests that the data is split into 80% for training and validation, and 20% for testing, but the exact proportion of the 80% allocated to training and validation is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide any information about stratification, randomization, or other methods used to ensure that the split is representative of the overall dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
