Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experimental setup, results, and discussion of the SeedNet model for image classification and retrieval tasks, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
