Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context appears to be focused on climate modeling, species distribution models, and downscaling climate data, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
