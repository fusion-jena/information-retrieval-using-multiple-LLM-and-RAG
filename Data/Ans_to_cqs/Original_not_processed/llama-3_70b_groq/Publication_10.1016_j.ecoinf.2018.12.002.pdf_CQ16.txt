Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the use of support vector machines and other supervised learning algorithms for automated interpretation of field ACC data on free-living animals, as well as the importance of discernible behavioral modes and ACC sampling frequency for classification accuracy. It also references various papers on machine learning, movement ecology, and signal extraction, but does not provide information on training completion criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
