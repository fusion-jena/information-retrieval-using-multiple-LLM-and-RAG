Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that satellite images are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions "Satellite images" as a source of data in section 2.2.1. Additionally, it mentions Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 imagery, as well as Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, which suggests that satellite-based sensors are used for data collection.

Furthermore, the context also mentions "in-situ measured data" in section 2.2.2, which implies that some form of ground-based measurements are also used for data collection. However, the exact methods or instruments used for these in-situ measurements are not specified.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that satellite images and in-situ measurements are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
