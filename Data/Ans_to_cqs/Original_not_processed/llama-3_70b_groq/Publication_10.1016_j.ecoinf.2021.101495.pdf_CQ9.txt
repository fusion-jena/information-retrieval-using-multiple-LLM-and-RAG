Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the computing infrastructure, search strategy, and training duration of the neural networks, as well as the hyperparameters used for training. It also provides information about the fish classification task, including the architecture of the residual neural network and the data used for training. However, it does not provide any information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
