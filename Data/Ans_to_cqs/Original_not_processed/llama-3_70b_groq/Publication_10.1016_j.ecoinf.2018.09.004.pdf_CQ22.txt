Answer:::

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F-measure

These metrics are used to measure the performance of the binary classification model. Accuracy is a suitable measure for model performance evaluation, but the applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to best).

Precision is defined as the fraction of relevant/correct instances among the retrieved instances for a class, while Recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances.

The F-measure score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, which provides a balanced measure of both precision and recall.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of correctly classifying presence and absence points of seagrass in Mediterranean and Sicily.
