Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, automates feature engineering and data preprocessing as part of its approach. This suggests that AutoGluon may perform certain preprocessing steps, but the specific steps are not detailed.

It is also worth noting that the context focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model selection, rather than preprocessing. Therefore, it does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and more information would be needed to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
