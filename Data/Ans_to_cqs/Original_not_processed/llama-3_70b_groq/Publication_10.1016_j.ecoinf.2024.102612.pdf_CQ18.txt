Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology for fuel model retrieval, the use of a deep learning (DL) model trained with synthetic data, and the validation of the model using real MS point clouds. It does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
