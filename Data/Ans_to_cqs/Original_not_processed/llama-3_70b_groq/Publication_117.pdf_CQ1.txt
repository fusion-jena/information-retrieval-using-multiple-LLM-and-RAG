Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the researchers collected census images and used citizen science data to create training sets for the deep learning algorithm. Additionally, it mentions the use of an online platform called Zooniverse to collect multiple non-expert counts by citizen scientists.

It can be inferred that the raw data collection method used in this study involves collecting aerial wildlife images, possibly through unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite platforms, or fixed camera traps, as mentioned in the context. However, the exact method of collecting raw data is not explicitly stated.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the availability of raw count data from Enlighten: Research Data, which suggests that the raw data may be publicly available. However, the exact method of collecting this data is not specified.
