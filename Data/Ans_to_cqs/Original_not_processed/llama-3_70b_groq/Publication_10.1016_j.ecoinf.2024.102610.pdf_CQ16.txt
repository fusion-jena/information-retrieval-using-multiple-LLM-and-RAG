Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on discussing the importance of spatial cross-validation, the separation of training and test data, and the need to adopt robust model evaluation techniques. It does not provide specific information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
