Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a research article about a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network, and it presents various results and comparisons of different models, but it does not discuss the data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
