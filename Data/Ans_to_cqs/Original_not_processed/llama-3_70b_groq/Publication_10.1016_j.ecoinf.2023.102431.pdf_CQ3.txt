Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the use of FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) for species and sex identification, and discusses the use of predictor screening analysis and bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object. It also mentions the manual marking of landmark points in the FIT interface, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
