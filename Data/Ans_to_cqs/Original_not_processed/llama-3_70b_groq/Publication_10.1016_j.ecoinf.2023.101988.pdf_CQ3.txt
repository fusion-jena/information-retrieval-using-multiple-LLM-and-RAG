Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological research, survey methods, and unmanned aircraft systems, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
