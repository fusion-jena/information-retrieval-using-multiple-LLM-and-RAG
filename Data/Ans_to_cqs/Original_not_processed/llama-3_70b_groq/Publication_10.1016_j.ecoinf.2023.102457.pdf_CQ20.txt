Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the use of pre-trained models such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, and mentions the computational cost of training a model with a large dataset, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training.
