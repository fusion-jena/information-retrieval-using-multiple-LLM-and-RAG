Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on fish biomass estimation, image processing, and object detection using deep learning techniques such as YOLO and fully convolutional neural networks.

However, it can be inferred that the authors are concerned about the quality of images and the need for manual intervention in the biomass estimation process. They highlight the importance of obtaining high-quality images to reduce the workload for humans. This implies that the authors might be aware of the potential issues with data bias, but they do not explicitly discuss techniques to address it.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
