Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The text discusses the ApisFis model, which appears to be a pollination model, and its comparison with field estimations and literature knowledge. It also mentions the use of the InVEST model and various tables, such as the pollinator species table and biophysical attribute table, but does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model.
