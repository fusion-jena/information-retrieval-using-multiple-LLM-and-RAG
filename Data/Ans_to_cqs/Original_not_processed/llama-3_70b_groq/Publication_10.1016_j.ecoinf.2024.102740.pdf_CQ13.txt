Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to random forest (RF) classification and regression, which is a machine learning technique, but not deep learning. The hyperparameters mentioned for RF are the maximum tree depth, minimum sample number, and maximum shaft number value, but not learning rate or optimizer.
