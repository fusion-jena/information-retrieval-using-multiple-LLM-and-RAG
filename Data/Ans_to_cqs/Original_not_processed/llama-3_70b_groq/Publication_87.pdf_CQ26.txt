Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning for image classification tasks, such as identifying animal species in images.

While the context does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias, it can be inferred that techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling might be relevant in this context. For instance, if the dataset is imbalanced, with some species having more images than others, stratified splitting could be used to ensure that each split has a similar proportion of images for each species. Oversampling or undersampling could also be used to balance the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the importance of collecting diverse data, such as using camera traps to collect images of animals in their natural habitats. This suggests that diverse data collection could be a technique used to address data bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the real-world environment.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to say which techniques are actually used to address data bias in this context.
