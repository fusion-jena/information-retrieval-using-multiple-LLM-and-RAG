Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context only mentions the use of deep learning strategies (e.g., neural networks) in species distribution modelling, but it does not provide information about the deployment of these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
