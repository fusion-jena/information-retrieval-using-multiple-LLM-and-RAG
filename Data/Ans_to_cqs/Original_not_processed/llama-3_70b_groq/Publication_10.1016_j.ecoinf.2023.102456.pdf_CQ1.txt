Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on forest fires, machine learning, and cellular automata, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

However, it can be inferred that historical databases and existing data are used to generalize the concept of neighbourhood relations in the intelligent cellular scheme presented in Section 5. This suggests that the data collection method might involve leveraging existing datasets or databases.

Additionally, the context mentions a survey on missing data in machine learning, which implies that surveys might be one of the methods used for collecting raw data. However, this is not explicitly stated in the context.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that historical databases and existing data might be used for collecting raw data, and surveys might also be a possible method. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
