Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the baseline model, the approach to incorporate additional information into the model, and the results of the experiments. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
