Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data preparation, model training, and reconstruction procedure. It discusses the division of data into training, validation, and testing sets, the use of batch normalization, and the handling of imbalanced categorical data. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
