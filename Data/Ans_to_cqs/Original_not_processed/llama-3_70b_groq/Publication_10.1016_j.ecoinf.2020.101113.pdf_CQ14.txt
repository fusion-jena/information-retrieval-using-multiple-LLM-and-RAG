Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that a pre-trained ResNet50 model is used, which is re-trained on the new data. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
