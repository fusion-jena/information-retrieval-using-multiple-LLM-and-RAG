Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context appears to be discussing a specific application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image segmentation, but it does not mention well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it seems to be using a custom dataset, possibly derived from OpenStreetMap data, as referenced in the context. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in this pipeline.
