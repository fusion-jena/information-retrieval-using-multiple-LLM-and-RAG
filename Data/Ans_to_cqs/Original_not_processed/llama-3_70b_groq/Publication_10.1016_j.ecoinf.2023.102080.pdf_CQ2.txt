Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in species distribution modeling (SDM), and it discusses various functions and arguments for filtering and embedding covariates. There is no mention of deep learning or data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
