Answer: 

Based on the provided context, one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is L2 regularization. This is mentioned in the context as the "L2 regularization parameter" which is used to control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set between 1e-2 and 1e-10, in line with benchmarks from similar studies.

There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context. However, it is a common regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but it is not mentioned in this specific context.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, so it's possible that other methods are used in addition to L2 regularization.
