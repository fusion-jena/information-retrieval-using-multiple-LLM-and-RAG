Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. The accuracy is reported for different models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on different datasets (raw, pre-processed, and swapped testing sets) in various tables. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. The context only focuses on the accuracy of the models in different scenarios.
