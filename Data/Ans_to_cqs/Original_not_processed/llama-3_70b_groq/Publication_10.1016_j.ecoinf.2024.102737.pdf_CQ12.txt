Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)" and also in the experiments section where Siamese architectures with 2 or 4 convolution layers are used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CNN in other studies, such as Salman et al., (2016) and Siddiqui et al., (2017), for fish species classification.
