Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, which suggests that the model was pre-trained on ImageNet or uses a similar normalization scheme. The actual dataset used for training and testing is a custom dataset of red kite images, with a total of 24,675 images in the training set, 32,986 images in the validation set, and 2060 images in the independent test set.
