Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This is mentioned in equation (2), which updates the weights as follows: wt+1 = µwt − α∆J(wt), where µ is the momentum weight and α is the learning rate.

There is no mention of Adam or other optimization techniques in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that SGD is the optimization technique used in this specific deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline, and it's possible that other optimization techniques might be used in other pipelines or scenarios. However, based on the provided information, SGD is the optimization technique applied in this specific case.
