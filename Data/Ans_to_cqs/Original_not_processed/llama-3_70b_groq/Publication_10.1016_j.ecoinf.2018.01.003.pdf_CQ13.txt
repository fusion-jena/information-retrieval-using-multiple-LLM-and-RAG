Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the development of neural networks, the emergence of deep learning, and the comparison between the BPNN model and the SVM model. It also explains the SVM method and its advantages, including the use of kernel functions to overcome nonlinearity and the curse of dimensionality. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
