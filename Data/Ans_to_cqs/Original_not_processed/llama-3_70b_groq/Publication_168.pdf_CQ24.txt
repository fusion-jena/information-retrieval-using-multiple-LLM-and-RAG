Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image classification tasks, specifically for forest species classification using UAV hyperspectral images. It discusses the use of CNNs for feature extraction and classification, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
