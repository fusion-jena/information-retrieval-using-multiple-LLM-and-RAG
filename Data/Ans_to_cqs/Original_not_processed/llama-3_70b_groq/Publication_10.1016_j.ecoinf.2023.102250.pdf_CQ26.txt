Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the proposed framework, attention mechanisms, and convolutional block attention modules, as well as spectral normalization and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition.

However, it does mention "image data augmentation for deep learning" in the reference by Shorten et al. (2019), which implies that data augmentation might be used to address data bias. Data augmentation is a technique that involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

Other than that, the context does not provide any information about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only suggest that data augmentation might be used to address data bias, but I don't know for sure, and I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
