Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the performance of different deep learning models (YOLOv5s, TPH-YOLOv5, and YOLOv5m) in detecting Pacific oysters using drone imagery, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
