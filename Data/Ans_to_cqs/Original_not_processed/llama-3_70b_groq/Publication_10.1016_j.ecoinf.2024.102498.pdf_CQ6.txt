Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for classification tasks, the hyperparameters set for different machine learning models, and the use of a pixel-based approach and deep learning techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
