Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions YOLOv5, which is an object detection architecture, but it does not specify the underlying framework used to implement it. YOLOv5 can be implemented in various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific framework used.
