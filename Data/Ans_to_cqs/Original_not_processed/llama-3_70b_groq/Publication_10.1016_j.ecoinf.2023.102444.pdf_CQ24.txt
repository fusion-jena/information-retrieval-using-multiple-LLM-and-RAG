Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, machine learning techniques, and dimensionality reduction methods like UMAP. It discusses the application of these methods in ecology and conservation management, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
