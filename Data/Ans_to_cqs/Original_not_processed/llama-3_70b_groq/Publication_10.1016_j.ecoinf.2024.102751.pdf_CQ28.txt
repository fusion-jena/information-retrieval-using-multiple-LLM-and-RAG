Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for deployment. The context appears to be related to a research study on water retention patterns on a coal mining heap, using satellite imagery and ALS data. It discusses the development of a predictive model, but does not provide information on the deployment of the model or the platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
