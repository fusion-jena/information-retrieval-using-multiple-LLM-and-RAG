Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on feature selection and fusion using various machine learning models, including LightGBM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. 

However, it does mention the calculation of cross-validation accuracy in the context of feature selection and fusion. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the evaluation metrics used, but it is not explicitly stated as a metric for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model. 

Other metrics commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, such as precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc., are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model based on the provided information.
