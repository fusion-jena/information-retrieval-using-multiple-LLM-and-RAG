Answer: 

The preprocessing steps involved in this study are proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries. Specifically, the original NDVI values were divided by a scale factor of 10,000 for proportional scaling. The projection transformations utilized the WGS1984-Albers projected coordinate system. Additionally, mask extraction was performed based on watershed boundaries, which were extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological analysis toolbox. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether these preprocessing steps are specifically for training a deep learning model. These steps seem to be general preprocessing steps for preparing the NDVI data for analysis.
