Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study by Huang et al. (2019). The context only mentions that the study used high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen, but it does not provide details on the model's development, training, or evaluation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the original study may have discussed these details, but they are not included in the provided context.
