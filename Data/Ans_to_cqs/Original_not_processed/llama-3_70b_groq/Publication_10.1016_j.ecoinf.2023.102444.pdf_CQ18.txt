Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the workflow to analyze the similarity between a target species and its environment using UMAP, and the assessment of UMAP as a binary classifier. It discusses the calculation of various metrics such as Pss, S, MIC, AUC, ROC, kappa index K, and point-biserial correlation (COR) index to evaluate the performance of UMAP. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
