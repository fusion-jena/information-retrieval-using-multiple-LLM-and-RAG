Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, including the selection of the number of nodes in the hidden layer, learning rate, and the number of epochs for model training. It also discusses the importance of avoiding overfitting and the use of early stopping technique to prevent it.

However, it does mention the calculation of the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data, which is a metric used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions the splitting of the data set into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing, which is a common practice in machine learning. But it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
