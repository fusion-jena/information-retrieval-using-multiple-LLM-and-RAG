Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be discussing various machine learning algorithms such as random forest, gradient boosting, artificial neural networks, and others, but it does not specify the purpose of these models. Additionally, the context does not mention deep learning models specifically. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
