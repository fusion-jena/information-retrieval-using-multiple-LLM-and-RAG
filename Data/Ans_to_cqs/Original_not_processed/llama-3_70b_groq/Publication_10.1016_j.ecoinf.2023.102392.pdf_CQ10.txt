Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of deep learning models, specifically XGBoost, to detect and categorize forest types using high-resolution remote sensing data. The context includes figures and tables showing the results of the study, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
