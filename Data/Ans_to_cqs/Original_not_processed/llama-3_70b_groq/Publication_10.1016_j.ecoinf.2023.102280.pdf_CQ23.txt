Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning-based denoising methods to bioacoustics and the challenges associated with it. It discusses the model architecture, training parameters, and data requirements, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
