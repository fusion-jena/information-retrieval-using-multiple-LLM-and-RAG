Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text discusses various deep learning architectures such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, and provides references to research papers and conferences. However, it does not mention the specific frameworks used to implement these architectures.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
