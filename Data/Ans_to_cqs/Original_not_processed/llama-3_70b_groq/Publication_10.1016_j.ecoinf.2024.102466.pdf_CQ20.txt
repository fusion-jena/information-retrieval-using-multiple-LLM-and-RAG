Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the performance of different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection and their evaluation, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training.
