Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of the proposed classification network and compares it with other models (ResNet50, ViT, and CA-Hybrid), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
