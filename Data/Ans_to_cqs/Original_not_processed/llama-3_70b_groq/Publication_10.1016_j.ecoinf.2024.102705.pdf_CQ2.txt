Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline, specifically camera trap images. This is mentioned in the text as "ecological information from camera trap images, including species labels, counts, and behaviors" and "image processing module". However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data is used, but the use of other formats is unknown.
