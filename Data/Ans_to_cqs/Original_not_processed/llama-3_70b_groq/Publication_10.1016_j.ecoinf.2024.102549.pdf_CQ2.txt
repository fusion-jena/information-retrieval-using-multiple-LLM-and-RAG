Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The context mentions CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architectures, such as AlexNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. The description of the AlexNet architecture and the mention of convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinear layers, and pooling layers in Fig. 3 also suggest that image data is being used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CNNs for image scene classification tasks and the processing of high-dimensional imagery. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as a data format used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that image data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
