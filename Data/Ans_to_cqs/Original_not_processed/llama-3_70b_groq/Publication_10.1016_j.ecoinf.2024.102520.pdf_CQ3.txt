Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover, and it discusses image acquisition and processing using remote sensing data from Landsat 8 and Google Earth Engine. It also mentions image preprocessing steps such as geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
