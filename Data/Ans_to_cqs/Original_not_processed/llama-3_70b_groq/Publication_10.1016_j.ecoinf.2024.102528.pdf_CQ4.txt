Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations and the analysis of the model's performance. It does not provide details on the data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
