Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance of the optimized models was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2).

2. Model interpretation using SHAP values: The SHAP values were calculated to understand the machine learning models. The average of the absolute SHAP values for each input variable was calculated to understand the contribution of each input variable to the model's predictions.

3. Model evaluation: The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models. Additionally, the RMSE for each observation site was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the provided context.
