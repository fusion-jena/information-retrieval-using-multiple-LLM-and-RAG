Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
