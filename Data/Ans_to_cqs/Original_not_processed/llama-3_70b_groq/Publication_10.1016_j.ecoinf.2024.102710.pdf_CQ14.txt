Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text focuses on the active learning experiments, sampling strategies, and the use of a pre-trained model (BirdNet-1) as the embedding model. It does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
