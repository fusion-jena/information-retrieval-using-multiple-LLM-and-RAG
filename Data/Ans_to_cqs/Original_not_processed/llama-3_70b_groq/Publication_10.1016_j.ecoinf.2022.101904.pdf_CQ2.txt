Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image classification, specifically for remote sensing imagery and wetland classification. The context mentions transformers, which are typically used for image recognition tasks, and references papers on image recognition at scale.

The figures provided, such as Figure 8, show classification maps of wetland areas, and Figure 9 shows extracted features of an urban object using convolutional layers of a CNN network. This suggests that the input data format is likely image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format typically used for tabular data, which is not relevant to the image classification tasks described in the context.

Therefore, the answer is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data.
