Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for drought propagation time prediction and its advantages over traditional methods. It discusses the architecture of the hybrid model, its ability to capture non-linear relationships and time lags, and the compilation of a comprehensive dataset for the study. However, it does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
