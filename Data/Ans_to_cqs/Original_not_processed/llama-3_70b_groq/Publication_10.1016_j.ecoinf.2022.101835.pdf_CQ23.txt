Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters for the Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and LightGBM models using Optuna, and the evaluation of their performance using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. It does not provide information on the dataset used or the methods employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
