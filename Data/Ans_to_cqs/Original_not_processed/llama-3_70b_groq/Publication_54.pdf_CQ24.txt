Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text only discusses the experimental settings, including data augmentation, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the endemic bird data is "randomly split" into training and testing sets, which implies that some form of randomness is introduced in the data splitting process. Additionally, the use of mini-batch gradient descent and the Adam optimizer may also involve some degree of randomness. Nevertheless, the context does not provide specific details on how randomness is handled or controlled in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
