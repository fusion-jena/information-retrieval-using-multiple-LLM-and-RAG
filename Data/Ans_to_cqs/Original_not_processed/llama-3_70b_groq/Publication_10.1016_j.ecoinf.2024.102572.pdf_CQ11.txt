Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions a link to the official documentation of a dataset (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084), but this is not related to a deep learning pipeline. The context also mentions Google Drive as a storage location for data in CSV format, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
