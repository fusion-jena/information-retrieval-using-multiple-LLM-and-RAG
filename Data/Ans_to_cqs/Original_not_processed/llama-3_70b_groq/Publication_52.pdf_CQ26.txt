Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their applications in biosecurity, particularly in machine hearing for marine species identification. It explains the basic theoretical framework of ELMs, their advantages, and their ability to learn from huge training data sets. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the provided context.
