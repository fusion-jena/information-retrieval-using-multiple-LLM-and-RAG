Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the use of repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, and 5 folds and 5 repetitions for the species meadow models. This suggests that the data was split into folds for cross-validation, but the exact proportions of the data allocated to training, testing, and validation sets are not specified.
