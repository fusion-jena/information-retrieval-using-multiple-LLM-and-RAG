Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to data curation and filtering for a ecological informatics study, and does not mention deep learning or regularization methods. The text discusses the processing of occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS, and the application of filters to clean the dataset. There is no mention of deep learning or overfitting, and therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
