Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the PTDLEN-VAE model, as well as its performance comparison with other techniques. 

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are calculated from the classification outcomes. Additionally, it presents the results in the form of tables and figures, but it does not provide information about saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not mentioned.
