Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning, regression tasks, and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, with references to various research papers and studies. There is no mention of data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
