Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to various topics such as flood susceptibility mapping, dry-wet variations, burned area mapping, vegetation change, and forest cartography. None of these references explicitly mention data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
