Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but it does not provide information about optimization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
