Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the architecture and implementation details of the model, such as the use of NASnet architecture, Faster-rcnn backbone, and TensorFlow2. It also provides information about the training process, dataset, and evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide any information about where the code is hosted or available for access. Therefore, I cannot determine the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
