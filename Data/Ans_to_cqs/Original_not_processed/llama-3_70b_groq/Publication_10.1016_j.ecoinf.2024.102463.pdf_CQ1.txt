Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of a deep learning tool, specifically the Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN), for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers. It discusses the architecture of the neural network, the optimization algorithm used, and the hyperparameters involved, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
