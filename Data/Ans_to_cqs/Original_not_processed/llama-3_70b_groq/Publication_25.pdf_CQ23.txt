Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, including the need for large training datasets and the limitations of existing approaches. It also mentions the potential benefits of combining labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, using self-supervised learning, and incorporating hyperspectral data to improve model performance. However, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
