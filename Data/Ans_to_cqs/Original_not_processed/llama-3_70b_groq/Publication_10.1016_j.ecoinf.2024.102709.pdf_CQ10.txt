Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article that discusses various topics related to ecological informatics, including data collection, feature extraction, and parameter estimation using ground-based systems such as TLS and MLS. It also references several other research papers and articles, but does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
