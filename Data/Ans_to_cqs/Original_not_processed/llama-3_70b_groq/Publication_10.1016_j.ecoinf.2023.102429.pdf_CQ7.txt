Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machines (SVM) for soil nutrient concentration analysis, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
