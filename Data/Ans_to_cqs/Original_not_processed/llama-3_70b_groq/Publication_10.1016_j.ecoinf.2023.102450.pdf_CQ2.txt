Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image and video. This is inferred from the description of the dataset in Table 2, which mentions the number of videos and images used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning techniques for object detection and motion monitoring in wildlife videos, which further supports the use of video data. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
