Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on metadata fields for image and data curation, documentation, and sampling protocols, but it does not delve into the specifics of annotation techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
