Answer:::
Answer: The framework used to build the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that all deep learning-related operations were performed in MATLAB 2020b, equipped with the Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Parallel Computing toolboxes. This suggests that the deep learning model was built using MATLAB's built-in deep learning capabilities, rather than a specific framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
