Answer::: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. One of the key measures was the use of five-fold cross-validation. This involved dividing the dataset into five folds, training the model on four folds, and validating it on the remaining fold. This process was repeated for each of the five folds, and the results were averaged to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. Specifically, 10% of the data was reserved for comparing the training and validation loss/accuracy after each epoch, and a further 10% was reserved for performance testing after all training had ceased. This splitting of the data helped to prevent overfitting and ensured that the model was evaluated on unseen data.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the use of cross-validation and data splitting suggests that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, more information would be needed to confirm whether the dataset was diverse and representative of the problem domain.
