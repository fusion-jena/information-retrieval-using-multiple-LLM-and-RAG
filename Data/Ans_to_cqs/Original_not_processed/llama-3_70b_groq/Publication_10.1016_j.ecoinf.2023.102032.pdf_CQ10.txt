Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. However, it does mention a GitHub repository link for Sentinel-2 Cloud Masking with s2cloudless, which is https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/tutorials/sentinel-2-s2cloudless/index.ipynb. This is not a deep learning pipeline, but rather a cloud masking tool for Sentinel-2 data. If you are looking for a deep learning pipeline, I don't know the answer as it is not provided in the context.
