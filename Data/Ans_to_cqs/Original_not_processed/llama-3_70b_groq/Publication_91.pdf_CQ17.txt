Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the dataset, data augmentation, and training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and decay factor, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
