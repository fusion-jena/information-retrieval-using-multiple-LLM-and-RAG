Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to machine learning and land use/land cover classification, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
