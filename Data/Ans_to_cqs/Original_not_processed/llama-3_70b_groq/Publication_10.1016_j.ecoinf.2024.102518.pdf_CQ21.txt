Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model, which are the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). 

It is likely that the model's performance was evaluated using these metrics, but the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
