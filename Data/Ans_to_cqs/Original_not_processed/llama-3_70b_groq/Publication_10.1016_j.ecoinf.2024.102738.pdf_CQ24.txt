Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE). It discusses the use of Random Forest for classification, the selection of input variables, and the evaluation of the classification results. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
