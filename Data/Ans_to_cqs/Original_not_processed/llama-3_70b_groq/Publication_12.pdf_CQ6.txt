Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the modifications made to the BatNet model, such as adding batch normalization layers to prevent overfitting, and optimizing the parameter setting of batch size. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is worth noting that the context mentions that the model was trained using a dataset of images, but it does not provide details on how these images were preprocessed before being used for training. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
