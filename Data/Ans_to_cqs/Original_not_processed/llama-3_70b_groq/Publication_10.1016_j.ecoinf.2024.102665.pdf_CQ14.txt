Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using an automated expectation-maximization process, which involves a random walk with 300 steps to minimize the MDL (Minimum Description Length) score. The final ten steps are used to check for stability with the number of clusters chosen for each taxon. This process is used to identify the optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in each.
