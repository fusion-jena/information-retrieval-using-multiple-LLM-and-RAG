Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions techniques such as dropout and ADAM optimization, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used to build the model.
