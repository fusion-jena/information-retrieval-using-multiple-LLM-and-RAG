Answer::

The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include the use of diverse datasets from different geographic sites, cross-site predictions, and transfer learning. The authors selected sites that were as different as possible to encompass a range of tree canopy conditions, which helped to increase the diversity of the dataset. 

To assess generalization, the authors performed three types of experiments: within-site, cross-site, and transfer learning. The within-site experiment used pretraining and hand-annotated data to predict the evaluation data from the same site. The cross-site experiment used pretraining data and hand-annotated data from the same site to predict the evaluation data from a different site. The transfer learning experiment used pretraining data from all other sites, but hand annotations from the same site as the evaluation data. 

These experiments helped to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data from different sites. The results showed that the model was able to generalize well, with an accuracy of 80% when using pretraining data from all sites. This suggests that the model learned flexible deep features that can be applied to different sites.
