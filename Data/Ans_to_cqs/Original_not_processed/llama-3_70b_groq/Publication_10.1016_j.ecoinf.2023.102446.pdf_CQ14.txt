Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the data collection and processing, the use of TPINet-based process network approach, and the analysis of variability in the pine-dominated ecosystem. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as the method used for grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
