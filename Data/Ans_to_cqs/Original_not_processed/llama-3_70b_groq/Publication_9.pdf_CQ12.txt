Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "CNNs" and "image recognition" in the context, as well as the reference to the paper "Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level performance on ImageNet classification" by He et al. (2015), which is a well-known paper on CNNs. Additionally, the context mentions "object detection/recognition" and "image segmentation", which are typical applications of CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
