Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is a binary classification model that classifies images into "dam" or "not dam" categories. The model is trained on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams and is used to automate the classification of images from the unlabelled training dataset.
