Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing imagery is used as a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the references to remote sensing in the context, such as in the papers by Laliberte and Ripple (2003), LaRue et al. (2017), and Leblanc et al. (2016). These papers discuss the use of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife counts, assessing vertebrate wildlife populations, and spectral reflectance of polar bear pelts, respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions high-resolution satellite imagery, which suggests that satellite-based remote sensing is also used for data collection. However, it does not mention other methods such as surveys or public datasets. Therefore, it can be concluded that remote sensing imagery, particularly from satellites, is a primary method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. The answer is limited to the specific context provided and may not be generalizable to all deep learning applications.
