Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (CNN) are accuracy and error rates. The accuracy results are mentioned in the text as 96.34% for training and 97.53% for the test data. Additionally, the confusion matrices (Tables 2 and 3) provide more detailed information about the performance of the model, including error rates and dispersion of errors between classes. However, precision and recall metrics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
