Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on describing the model architectures, including Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+, and their components, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
