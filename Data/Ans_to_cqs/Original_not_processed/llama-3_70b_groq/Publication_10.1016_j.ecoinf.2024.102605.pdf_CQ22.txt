Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (1D-CNN) are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient. The text states that "these sensitive spectral vegetation indices perform well in the 1D-CNN model, with an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 89.50% and 0.8666, respectively." This suggests that the authors used OA and Kappa Coefficient to evaluate the performance of their model. However, it does not mention other common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
