Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context provides information about the architecture of the model, including the layers, patch sizes, strides, and output sizes, as well as references to various papers and experiments. However, it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
