Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep-learning methods for classification in entomology, specifically for pest management, and discusses the challenges and limitations of using these methods. It also presents the results of experiments with different models and architectures. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
