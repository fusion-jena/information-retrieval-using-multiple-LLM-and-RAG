Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention dropout as a form of regularization that randomly removes a proportion of nodes to reduce overfitting. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of handling randomness in their deep learning model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a specific threshold value (acceptance value = 0.1) in the DeepMeerkat model, which prioritizes minimizing false negatives at the potential expense of increasing false positives. This could be seen as a strategy to handle randomness in the model's predictions.

However, the context does not provide explicit information on how random seed values are handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in this context.
