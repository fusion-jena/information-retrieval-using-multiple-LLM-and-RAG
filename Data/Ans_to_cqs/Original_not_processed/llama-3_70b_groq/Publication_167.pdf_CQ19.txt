Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. It only explains the structure and functionality of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and its application in the deep learning module. It does not provide information about the specific frameworks used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
