The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a survey of public weed datasets, a dataset curation process, and a cross-season weed detection pipeline, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context does mention GitHub links to specific libraries and issues, but not a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
