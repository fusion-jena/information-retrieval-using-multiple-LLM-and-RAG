Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing a comparison of different covariate selection procedures and their impact on model accuracy and computation time in the field of ecological informatics. There is no mention of deep learning models or model deployment.
