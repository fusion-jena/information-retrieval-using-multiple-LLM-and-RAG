Answer: 

According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows: 

The data is split into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. The validation set is used during training for fine-tuning hyperparameters and model selection. The test set is used to assess the prediction error of the best model setup. 

The splitting process is done randomly. First, a random sample of 10% from the total number of tiles is taken as the validation set. Then, a further sample of 10% is taken as the test set. The remaining 80% of the tiles are used as the training set. 

Additionally, data augmentation is performed on the training set to artificially increase the number of training samples by applying slight transformations on the original data. This helps to prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles.
