Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions the use of ResNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is typically used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC), which is a benchmark for image classification models. Furthermore, the case-study involves discriminating 20 coral reef fish species, which suggests that the input data consists of images of these species.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to a separate paper titled "Neural Networks Audio-based Bird Species Identification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks", which suggests that audio data formats may be used in a different context.

There is no mention of CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV files are typically used for tabular data, which is not relevant to the image classification task described in the context.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be images.
