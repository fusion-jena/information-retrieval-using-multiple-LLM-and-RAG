Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, and it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
