Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation and selection of different deep learning models for landscape type classification, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, to prepare the data for training. Normalization and scaling can help to reduce the effect of feature scaling and improve the model's performance. Cleaning the data involves removing missing or noisy data points, handling outliers, and transforming the data into a suitable format for the model.

Since the context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps, it is unclear what exact steps were taken in this particular case.
