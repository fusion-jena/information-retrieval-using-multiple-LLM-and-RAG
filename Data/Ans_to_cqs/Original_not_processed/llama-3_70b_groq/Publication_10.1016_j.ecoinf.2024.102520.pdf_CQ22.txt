Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of spatial predictions using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Geometric Index of Agreement (G). The context also mentions the use of leave-one-out cross-validation to check the accuracy of the spatial predictions. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
