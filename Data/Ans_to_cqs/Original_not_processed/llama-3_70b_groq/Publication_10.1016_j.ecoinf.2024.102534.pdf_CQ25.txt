Answer: 
The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather an ensemble model incorporating Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) components. The model is used to predict current and future suitable areas of orchids under land cover and climate change. The model's output is a predictive map of suitable areas, which are classified into unsuitable (0-0.6) and suitable (0.6-1) areas. The model's purpose is to identify the potential impact of climate change and land cover change on suitable areas for each group of orchids. Therefore, the purpose of the model can be inferred as a classification task, where the model predicts the suitability of areas for orchid growth.
