Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. This implies that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or ratio for this split is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the creation of a testing dataset, which was used to test the efficacy of the models. The testing dataset was created by using the same sliding window approach as in training, and multiple segments were created across the entire testing file. However, the proportion of data allocated to the testing set is not mentioned.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, but it does imply that the data was split into training, validation, and testing sets.
