Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses hard negative mining, IoU thresholds, and model performance evaluation, but it does not provide information about the stopping criteria for training. 

It is possible that the training process is based on trials and errors, as mentioned in one of the context pieces, but this does not provide a clear answer to the query. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
