Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only mentions that the point cloud test set is segmented, and the final segmentation results are obtained, which include point cloud geometric partition graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results. There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
