Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline are primarily related to remote sensing and hyperspectral imaging technology. 

Specifically, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 data, which is a satellite-based remote sensing system. It also references various studies that utilize hyperspectral imaging technology, such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images, Landsat-8 OLI data, and SPOT-5 images. These data sources are likely used to collect raw data for deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of single-board computers as low-cost instruments for collecting data, specifically for estimating SPAD values through color images and chlorophyll-related spectral indices.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other contexts or applications.

Overall, the primary methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as suggested by the provided context, are satellite-based remote sensing and hyperspectral imaging technology.
