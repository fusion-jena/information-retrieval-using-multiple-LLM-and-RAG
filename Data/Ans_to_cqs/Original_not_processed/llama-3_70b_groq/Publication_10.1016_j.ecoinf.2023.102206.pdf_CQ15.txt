Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various topics, including the use of IFTL (Iterative Feature Transfer Learning) to improve the knowledge transfer of different models (ELM, GRNN, and SVR), transfer learning approaches, and ecological informatics. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
