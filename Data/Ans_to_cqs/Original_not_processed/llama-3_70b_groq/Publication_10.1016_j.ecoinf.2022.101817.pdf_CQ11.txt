Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics related to computer vision, machine learning, and freshwater biodiversity monitoring. It cites several references and provides tables and figures, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
