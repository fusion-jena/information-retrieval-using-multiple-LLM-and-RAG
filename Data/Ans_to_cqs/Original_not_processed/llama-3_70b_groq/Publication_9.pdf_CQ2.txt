Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the references to ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database (Deng et al., 2009), and the discussion of processing fish images and using pre-trained CNNs for image recognition tasks. Additionally, the context mentions segmentation mask annotations, which is a common technique used in image processing and computer vision tasks.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that other data formats like CSV might be used for storing or processing metadata related to the images, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline, based on the provided context, is images.
