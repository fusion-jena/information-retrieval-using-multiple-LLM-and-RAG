Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically satellite images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. This is evident from the references to water body extraction, water quality estimation, and suspended sediment concentration prediction using these images. 

Additionally, there is a mention of UAV images in the context of wind erosion rates, which further supports the notion that image data is a key component of the deep learning pipeline.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store and process other types of data, such as wind speed or water quality metrics, that are used as inputs or outputs of the deep learning models.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be image data, specifically satellite and UAV images, with a possible secondary use of CSV files for other types of data.
