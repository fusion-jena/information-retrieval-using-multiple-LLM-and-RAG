Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it mentions the use of XGBoost and LightGBM, which are gradient boosting frameworks, not deep learning frameworks. These frameworks are used for building tree-based models, not deep neural networks. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context which deep learning framework is used to build the model.
