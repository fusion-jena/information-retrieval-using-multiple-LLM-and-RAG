Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The text discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) for predicting Ecological Footprint (EF) values, but it does not provide information on how the performance of these models is monitored during training.
