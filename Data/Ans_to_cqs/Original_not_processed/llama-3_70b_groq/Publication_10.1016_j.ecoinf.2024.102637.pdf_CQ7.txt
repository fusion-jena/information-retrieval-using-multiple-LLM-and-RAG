Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and optimization of deep learning models, particularly the SIAlex model, and its comparison with other models. It discusses the use of structural re-parameterization techniques, convolutional layers, and activation functions, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
