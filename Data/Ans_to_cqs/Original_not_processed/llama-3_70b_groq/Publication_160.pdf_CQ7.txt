Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It only mentions that the deeply learned features and the different layer outputs of the training, validation, and test sets were extracted in advance, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into these sets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
