Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the results improved dramatically when the authors fully optimized their choice for the parameter values, but it does not specify the optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
