Answer:::

Based on the provided context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, it is mentioned that "We added a dropout layer for each convolutional layer with a dropout rate of '0.1' to mitigate overfitting [43]". This indicates that dropout was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

However, there is no mention of L2 regularization being used in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may have been used, but they are not explicitly mentioned.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions the importance of having a large amount of training data and augmenting the training dataset to mitigate issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data. This can also be seen as a way to prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data.
