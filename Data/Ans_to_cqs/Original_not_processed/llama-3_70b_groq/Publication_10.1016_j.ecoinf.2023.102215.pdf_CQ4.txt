Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of neural networks, particularly the use of dilated convolutions, nested models, and attention mechanisms for feature extraction and image segmentation. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
