Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used for classification, specifically precision and recall, and how they are calculated. It also discusses the variability in the quality of citizen science user annotations and the potential for using these annotations to train detection algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
