Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of estimating biomass in turbid environments, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges. It also mentions various deep learning models and techniques, such as Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and YOLO, but does not provide a link to a code repository. The figures mentioned in the text appear to be related to hyperparameter tuning and model performance, but do not provide a link to a code repository either. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
