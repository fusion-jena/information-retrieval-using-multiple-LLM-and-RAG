Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of a regularized cost function using stochastic gradient descent, embedding layers, and the implementation of algorithms in Pytorch. It also discusses the training process, including the use of a validation set, batch size, and number of epochs.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent, which is an optimization algorithm that inherently involves randomness. Additionally, the use of a batch size of 64 samples during training implies that the algorithm is processing the data in batches, which can help reduce the impact of randomness.

Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this query.
