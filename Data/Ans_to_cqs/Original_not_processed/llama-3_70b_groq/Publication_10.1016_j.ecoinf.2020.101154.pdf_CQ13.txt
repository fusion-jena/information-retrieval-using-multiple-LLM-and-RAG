Answer:::
Answer: The context provided does not mention a deep learning model. It appears to be discussing Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are specific to GBRT models and include:

* Learning rate: 0.05 for RI CS and RI NW models, 0.01 for RI NW model, and 0.005 for RY CS and RY NW models
* Maximum tree depth: 4 for RI CS and RI NW models, 6 for RI NW model, and 2 or 8 for RY CS and RY NW models
* Number of iterations: determined by early stopping, with values ranging from 102 to 500
* Subsample rate: 0.75% for all models

There is no mention of an optimizer or other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models.
