Answer: 

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only discusses the experiment design, the results, and the statistical analysis using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and R packages glmmTMB and DHARMa. There is no information about hyperparameter tuning or optimization methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
