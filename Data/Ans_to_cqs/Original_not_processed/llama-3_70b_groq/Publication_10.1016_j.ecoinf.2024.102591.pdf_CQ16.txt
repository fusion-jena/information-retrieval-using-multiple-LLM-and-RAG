Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a wildfire mapping system called FIREMAP, which uses satellite imagery to assess burned areas, fire severity, and vegetation recovery. The text describes the system's functionality, input data, and validation datasets, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.
