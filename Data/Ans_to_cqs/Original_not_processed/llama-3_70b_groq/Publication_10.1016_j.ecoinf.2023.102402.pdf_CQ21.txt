Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the model's accuracy and performance. 

It can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as the context mentions the calculation of AUC and TSS values. However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these steps are involved or not.
