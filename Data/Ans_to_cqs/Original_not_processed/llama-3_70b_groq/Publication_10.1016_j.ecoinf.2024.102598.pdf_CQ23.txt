Answer: 

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms and ensemble modeling to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability. 

To ensure the generalizability of the ML models, the following measures were taken:

1. Cross-validation: A 10-fold cross-validation design was used to calibrate and validate each model. This involves dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, and the average performance is calculated.

2. Data splitting: The data was split into training (70%) and validation sets (30%) for each run of the cross-validation procedure.

3. Ensemble modeling: The predictions from multiple ML algorithms were combined using the AUC-weighted ensemble method to mitigate the risks of errors and biases, resulting in stable predictions that generalize well to unseen data.

These measures help to ensure that the ML models are generalizable and can perform well on unseen data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
