Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the architecture of VGG16, the optimization algorithm of CNNs, and the techniques used to reduce overfitting, such as batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay. It also discusses the label-only attack and the challenge of generalization in deep learning models. However, it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques.
