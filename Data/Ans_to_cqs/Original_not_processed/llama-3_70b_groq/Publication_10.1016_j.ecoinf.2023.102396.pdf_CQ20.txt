Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be related to a research article in the field of ecological informatics, discussing topics such as animal abundance, spatiotemporal variations, and time series analysis. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
