Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of transfer learning, the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the training process of a model for plant organ detection in herbarium scans.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation, among others. Normalization and scaling are used to ensure that the input data has a similar range, which can improve the model's performance. Cleaning involves removing any noise or irrelevant data from the dataset. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps used in this particular case, it is impossible to determine the exact steps involved.
