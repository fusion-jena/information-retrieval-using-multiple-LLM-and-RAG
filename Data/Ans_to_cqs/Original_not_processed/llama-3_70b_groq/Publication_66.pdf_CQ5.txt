Answer: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the application of deep learning to animal tracking data, specifically GPS data from seabirds, to predict diving behavior. It does not mention any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in image recognition tasks. The GPS track data used in the analysis is available at http://seabirdtracking.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950, but this is not a standard dataset like the ones mentioned in the query.
