Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to environmental mapping and machine learning applications in geostatistics, discussing the importance of accuracy assessment for thematic maps produced by calibrated statistical prediction methods. 

The datasets mentioned in the context are related to environmental variables, such as above-ground biomass, soil carbon stock, and land cover change, which are used as predictors in machine learning approaches. These datasets include:

1. Elevation data (used to compute topographic variables such as slope, aspect, and terrain ruggedness index)
2. Forest height data
3. Spatial configuration of observed AGB pixels in central Africa
4. Distance from coast data
5. Land mask data

These datasets are used to produce maps of environmental variables, but they are not typical deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
