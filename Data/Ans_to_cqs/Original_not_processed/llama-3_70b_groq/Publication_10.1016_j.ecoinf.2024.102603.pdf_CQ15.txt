Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, discussing their differences in terms of computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. It does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
