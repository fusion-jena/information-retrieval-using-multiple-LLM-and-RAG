Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of ResNet models, particularly in the context of object detection in UAV thermal images. It discusses the limitations of deeper CNN layers in retaining spatial information and the benefits of using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to combine feature maps from different layers. 

While preprocessing is an essential step in deep learning, the provided context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved in the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
