Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from various sources, including:

1. Soil Moisture Probe: This suggests that soil moisture data is collected using probes or sensors.
2. AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a): This is a meteorological agency that provides data on weather-related variables such as pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and radiation.
3. Radiation Station: This implies that radiation data is collected from radiation stations.
4. Eddy Covariance Station: This suggests that data on fluxes such as sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and carbon dioxide flux is collected using eddy covariance stations.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that the data from these sources is combined with other data from public datasets or surveys, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
