Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text discusses the use of computational tools, genetic algorithms, and the Least Squares method for optimization and parameter estimation in an ecological context. It also mentions the use of Python and the Ray package for parallel computing, but there is no mention of deep learning or any specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model as it is not mentioned in the context.
