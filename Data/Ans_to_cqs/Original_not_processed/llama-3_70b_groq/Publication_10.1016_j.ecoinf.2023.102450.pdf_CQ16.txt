Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a dataset of videos of animals (lions, wolves, zebras, and giant pandas) with different motion trajectory patterns (straight line, 8-shaped curve, and circular curve). It discusses the success plot, overlap rate, and cross-correlation coefficients, but it does not provide any information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
