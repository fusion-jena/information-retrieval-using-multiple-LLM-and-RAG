Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image classification, particularly for forest species classification using UAV hyperspectral images. It provides references to other research papers and mentions the authors and their affiliations, but it does not provide a link to a data repository.
