Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the CNN is implemented in Python using Lasagne and data stream multiplexing (for training) is implemented using Pescador. There is no mention of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resources. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
