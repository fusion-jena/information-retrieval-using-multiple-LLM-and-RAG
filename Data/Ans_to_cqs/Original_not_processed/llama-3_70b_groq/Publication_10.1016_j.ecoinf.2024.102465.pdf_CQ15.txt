Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models such as ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and HRNet, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train these models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of XGBoost algorithm with interpretable results through SHAP value analysis in one of the references (Todorovic et al., 2023). XGBoost is a popular gradient boosting algorithm, but it is not an optimization technique used in deep learning pipelines.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
