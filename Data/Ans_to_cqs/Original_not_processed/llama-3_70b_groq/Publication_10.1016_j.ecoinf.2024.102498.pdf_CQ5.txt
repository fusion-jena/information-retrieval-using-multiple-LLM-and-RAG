Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a benchmark dataset called So2Sat LCZ42, which is used for the classification of global local climate zones. Additionally, the context mentions the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing data, such as MODIS NDVI, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for general image classification tasks.
