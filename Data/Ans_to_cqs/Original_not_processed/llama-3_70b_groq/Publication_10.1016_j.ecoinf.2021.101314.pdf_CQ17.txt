Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters and thresholds to control the size and complexity of queries. It also discusses filtering and ranking redescriptions based on accuracy and removing redundant ones. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
