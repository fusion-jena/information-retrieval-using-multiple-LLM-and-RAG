Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the evaluation of fusion quality, feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV), and the classification model and schemes. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
