Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the optimization was performed using the L-BFGS-B method, which is a quasi-Newton approach that can resolve functions with simple constraints. This method was used to optimize the weights of the indicators in the TOPSIS method, ensuring that they were positive and not greater than 1. 

There is no mention of grid search or random search, which are common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, it can be inferred that these methods were not used in this particular study.
