Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is for detection, specifically for detecting artisanal and small-scale mines. This is evident from the context provided, particularly in the papers by Couttenier et al. (2022) and Elmes et al. (2020), which discuss the use of deep learning models for mapping artisanal and small-scale mines from space and detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, respectively. The model is designed to classify pixels as mining or non-mining areas, and the additional processing steps, such as selecting mining pixels above 3 pixel sizes, are aimed at improving the accuracy of the detection.
