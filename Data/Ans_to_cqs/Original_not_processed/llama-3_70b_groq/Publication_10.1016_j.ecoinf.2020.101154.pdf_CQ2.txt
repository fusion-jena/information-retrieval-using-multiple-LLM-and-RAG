Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the pipeline are not related to deep learning, but rather to Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. The context mentions datasets such as CS and NW, which seem to contain data related to herring populations and environmental factors like salinity and sea surface temperature (SST). 

The data formats mentioned in the context are tables from ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) reports and datasets from sources like NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the MET Office Hadley Centre. These datasets are likely in CSV or similar formats, but this is not explicitly stated. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
