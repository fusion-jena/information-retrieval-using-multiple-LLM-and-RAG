Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions "DNN architectures" and "models" without specifying the type of deep learning model used. It discusses hyperparameters, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques, but does not provide information about the specific type of model used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
