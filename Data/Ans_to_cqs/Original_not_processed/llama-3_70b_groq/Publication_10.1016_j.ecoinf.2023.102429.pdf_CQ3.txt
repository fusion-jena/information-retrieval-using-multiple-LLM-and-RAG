Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to soil organic carbon estimation using spectral data and various machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
