Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to soil salinity distribution mapping, groundwater dynamics, and land use analysis, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
