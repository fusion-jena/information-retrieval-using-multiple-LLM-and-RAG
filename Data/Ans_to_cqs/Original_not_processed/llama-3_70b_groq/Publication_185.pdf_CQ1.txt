Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, the architecture of the AlexNet model, and its application in image classification tasks. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
