Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the challenges of creating and utilizing CNNs for bioacoustics research questions, presents pre-processing hyper-parameters for each dataset, and compares the average F1 score across different network architectures and dataset configurations. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used for hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or any other method.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
