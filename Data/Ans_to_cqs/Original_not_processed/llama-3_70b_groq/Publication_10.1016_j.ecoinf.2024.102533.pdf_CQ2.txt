Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The references cited in the text are related to fish freshness evaluation, fish grading, and fish quality assessment, but they do not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions "imaging framework" in one of the references, which suggests that image data might be involved, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
