Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline is collected from a public dataset. Specifically, the dataset used is the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains images of plant leaves in grey scale, with 24 species shown in Figure 5. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. Instead, the dataset is downloaded from the UCI repository and then augmented to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting.
