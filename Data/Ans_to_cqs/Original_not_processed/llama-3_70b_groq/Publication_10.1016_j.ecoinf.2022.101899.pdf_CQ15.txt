Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the application of deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, discussing the methodology and results of different studies. It mentions the use of six different optimizer models using deep learning technology in Halgamuge et al. (2020), but it does not specify the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
