Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, discussing the architecture and components of CNNs, and techniques to improve their performance, such as attention mechanisms and transfer learning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, including setting a random seed value, to ensure reproducibility of results and control over the randomness introduced during training. This is not mentioned in the provided context, but it is a general practice in the field of deep learning.

In summary, the context does not provide information on strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, but it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value and employ other strategies to control randomness.
