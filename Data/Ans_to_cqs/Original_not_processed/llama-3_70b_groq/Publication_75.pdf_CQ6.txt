Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed model, SeedNet, and its performance on seed image classification and retrieval tasks. It describes the network architecture, the input image size, and the activation functions used, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
