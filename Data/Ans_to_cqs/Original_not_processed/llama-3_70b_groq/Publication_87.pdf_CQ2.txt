Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions "a set of manually labelled images" and "a set of unlabelled images" as part of the training and prediction process, respectively. Additionally, the code snippet shows the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically a resnet18, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
