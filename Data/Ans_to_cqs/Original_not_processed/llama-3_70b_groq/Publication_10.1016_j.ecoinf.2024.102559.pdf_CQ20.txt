Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to machine learning and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training a model. The papers cited are about scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, and ecological informatics, but they do not mention specific hardware resources. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
