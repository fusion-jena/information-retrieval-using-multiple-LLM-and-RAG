Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper or academic work, focusing on the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, including MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and VGG16, with dynamic convolutional decomposition. It discusses the classification results, precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and top-1 and top-5 errors of these models on different datasets. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for these models.
