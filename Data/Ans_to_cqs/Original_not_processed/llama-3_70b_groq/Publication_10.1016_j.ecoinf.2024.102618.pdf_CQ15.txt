Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep-learning models, the architectures of the models (e.g., EfficientNet, InceptionResNetv2, ResNet50v2), and the results of the experiments. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
