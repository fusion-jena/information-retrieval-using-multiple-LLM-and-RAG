Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The text appears to be discussing a monitoring program for the dive community, collecting data on marine taxa, and assessing the usability of an app. There is no mention of machine learning or model optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
