Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology and evolution, particularly in bird species identification through audio recordings. It discusses the potential of deep learning techniques for monitoring bird diversity and acoustic activity, but it does not delve into the technical details of implementing these techniques, including handling randomness.
