Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the use of validation data sets and the calculation of accuracy metrics such as the proportion of correctly classified cases and the Area Under the Curve (AUC).

In the model selection procedure, the accuracy of candidate models is compared using a left-out validation data set (Av), and the model with the highest performance is selected for further training. Additionally, the optimal number of training epochs is determined using a validation data set (Bv). This suggests that the model performance is monitored during training using these validation data sets.

However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not explicitly stated. It is also not clear if techniques such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling are used to prevent overfitting or improve model performance.
