Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as coral reefs, synthetic data, and deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. It mentions Python packages and libraries, such as y-data-synthetic and Synthetic Data Vault, but it does not specify a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
