Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The code snippet only shows the architecture of the model (resnet18), the metrics used (accuracy and error_rate), and the training process using fit_one_cycle with SaveModelCallback. It does not provide information about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
