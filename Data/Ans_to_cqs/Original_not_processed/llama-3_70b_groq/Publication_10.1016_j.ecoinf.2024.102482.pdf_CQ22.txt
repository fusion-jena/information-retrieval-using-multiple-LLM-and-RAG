Answer: According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. These metrics are defined as follows: 

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
F1 = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the LSTM model in detecting water pollution.
