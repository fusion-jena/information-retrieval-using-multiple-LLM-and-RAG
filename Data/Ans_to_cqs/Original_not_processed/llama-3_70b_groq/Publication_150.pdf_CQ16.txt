Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "models were trained for 150 epochs" and that "the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs". This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs (150) and the learning rate was adjusted during training, but it does not provide information on whether a specific criterion, such as validation loss plateau, was used to determine when training was complete.
