Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is model validation. The model was trained on a cloud service, and during training, the model performance was validated using a validation data set. The validation data set was used to calculate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each class. This allowed the researcher to evaluate the model's performance during training and make adjustments as needed.
