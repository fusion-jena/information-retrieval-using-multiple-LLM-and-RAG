Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in various domains, including image analysis and segmentation, and discusses the challenges of obtaining ground truth data and the potential for improvement through the development of more specific detectors or user interfaces. 

While the context does mention the use of deep learning-based models and their performance in comparison to other methods, it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
