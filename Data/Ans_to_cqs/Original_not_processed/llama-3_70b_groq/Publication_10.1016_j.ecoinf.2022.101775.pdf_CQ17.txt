Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that 10% of the data was used as a validation set to check for overfitting during the training process. This implies that the authors were aware of the overfitting issue and took steps to prevent it, but the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent to optimize the regularized cost function, but it does not specify the type of regularization used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether dropout, L2 regularization, or other regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting.
