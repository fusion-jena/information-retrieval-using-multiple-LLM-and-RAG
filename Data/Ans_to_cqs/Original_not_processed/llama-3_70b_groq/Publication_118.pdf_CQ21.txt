Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the research design, dataset, data pre-processing, and training of an auto-encoder model. It also mentions the evaluation of the feature representation produced by the auto-encoder and the computation times for generating acoustic indices, MFCC, and the feature representation. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
