Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. One of the primary measures was the use of fivefold cross-validation. This involved splitting the dataset into five equal-sized folds, where each fold was used once as the validation set and the remaining four folds were used as the training set. This process was repeated five times, and the model's performance was evaluated on each validation set. The average performance across the five iterations was used to estimate the model's generalizability.

Another measure taken was the use of hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters were carefully selected to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance. Hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and subsample were tuned to control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting. The learning rate was also tuned to prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the use of random_state and subsample hyperparameters helped to reduce overfitting. The random_state hyperparameter was used to ensure reproducibility, and the subsample hyperparameter was used to reduce overfitting by reducing the number of samples used to train the model.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of fivefold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
