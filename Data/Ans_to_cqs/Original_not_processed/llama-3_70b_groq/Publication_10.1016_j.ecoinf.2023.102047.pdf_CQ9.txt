Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a literature review or a research paper discussing various deep learning models and their applications in seagrass coverage estimation and object detection. It cites several research papers and references, but it does not provide information about a data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
