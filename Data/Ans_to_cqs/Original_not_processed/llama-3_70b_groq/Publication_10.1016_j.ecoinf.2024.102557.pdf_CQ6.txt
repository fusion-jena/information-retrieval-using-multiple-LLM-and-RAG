Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology, conservation biology, and environmental science, as well as the use of machine learning models in understanding relationships between variables. 

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial before training a deep learning model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, and data transformation, among others. The specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset, model, and problem at hand.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
