Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the training and testing of a deep learning model, specifically a YOLOv5 model with an attention layer, and discusses the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. There is no mention of data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
