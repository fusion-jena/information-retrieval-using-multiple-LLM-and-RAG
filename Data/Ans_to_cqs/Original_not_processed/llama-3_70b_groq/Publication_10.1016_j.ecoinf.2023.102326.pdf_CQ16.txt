Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to ecological informatics and acoustic monitoring, and it does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are terms commonly used in machine learning. The context includes tables and figures related to land use types, average shortest path length, and standard deviation, but it does not provide any information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
