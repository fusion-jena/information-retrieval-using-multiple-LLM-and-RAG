Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, soil mapping, and classification methods, with references to machine learning algorithms like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
