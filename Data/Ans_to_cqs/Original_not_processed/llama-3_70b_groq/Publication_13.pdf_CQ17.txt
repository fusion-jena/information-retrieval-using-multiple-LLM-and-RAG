Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the context as "the numbers of units in the two FC layers (512 and 256 for the first and second FC layers, respectively) and the dropout rate were determined by five-fold cross-validation."

There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that dropout is the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in this specific deep learning pipeline.
