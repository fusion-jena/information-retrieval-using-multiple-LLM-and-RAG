Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are not explicitly mentioned as traditional deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, the text does mention the use of true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and accuracy. 

The true positive rate (TPR) is calculated as TP / (TP + FN), and the false positive rate (FPR) is calculated as FP / (FP + TN). The accuracy is also mentioned, but its formula is not provided. 

It is worth noting that the text does not mention other common deep learning metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or mean absolute error.
