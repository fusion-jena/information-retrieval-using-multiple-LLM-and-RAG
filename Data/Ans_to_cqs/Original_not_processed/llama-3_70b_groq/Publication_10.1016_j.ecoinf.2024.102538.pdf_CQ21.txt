Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model's training process, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it does mention that the model's performance was assessed using the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), accuracy (ACC), and hierarchical distance of a mistake (HDM) as metrics. This implies that some form of metrics calculation was involved, but the exact steps are not specified. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, except for the calculation of evaluation metrics such as MRR, ACC, and HDM.
