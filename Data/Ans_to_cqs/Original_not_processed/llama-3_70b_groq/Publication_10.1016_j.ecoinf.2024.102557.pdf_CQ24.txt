Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and machine learning algorithms, specifically random forests, for predicting fungal productivity. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
