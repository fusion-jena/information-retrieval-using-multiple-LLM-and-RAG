Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only mentions that the ANN model was implemented using the "nnet" package, which is a package in R for feed-forward neural networks. It does not provide information on the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
