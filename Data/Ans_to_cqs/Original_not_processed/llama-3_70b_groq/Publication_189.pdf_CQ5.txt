Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the implementation of Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation, but it does not specify the datasets used for training and testing. It only mentions that the dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom training, using images collected from a KaKaXi fixed camera. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in this pipeline.
