Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about building a deep learning model or using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as continuous cover forestry, diversity indices, and estimators for calculating values from sample trees. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model based on the provided context.
