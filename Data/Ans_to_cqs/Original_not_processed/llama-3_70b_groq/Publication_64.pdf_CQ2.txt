Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant classification, which is a typical approach for image classification tasks. Additionally, the dataset descriptions, such as the Portuguese Flora dataset, mention images belonging to different plant species, further supporting the use of image data formats. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
