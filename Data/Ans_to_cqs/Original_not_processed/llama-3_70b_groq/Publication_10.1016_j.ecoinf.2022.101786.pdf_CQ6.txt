Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the model configuration, training process, and evaluation metrics. It discusses the model parameters, batch size, subdivisions, and iterations, as well as the use of manual annotations for generating training, validation, and testing datasets. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
