Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the model architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the number of training steps used for each challenge. It does not provide information about the hyperparameters used to train the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
