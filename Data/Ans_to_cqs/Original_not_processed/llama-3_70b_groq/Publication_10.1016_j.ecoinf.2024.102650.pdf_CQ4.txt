Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on text processing, data cleaning, and theme perception technology using machine learning models, specifically the ERNIE model. It discusses text preprocessing steps like word segmentation and stop word removal, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
