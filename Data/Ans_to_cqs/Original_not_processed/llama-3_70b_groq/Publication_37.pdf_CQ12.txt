Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, specifically in the introduction where it is stated that the authors explored two state-of-the-art classification techniques, one of which is a "deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation". Additionally, the context provides details about the implementation of the CNN model, including the optimization algorithm, hyperparameters, and software libraries used.
