Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The discussion focuses on the comparison of citizen science and deep learning methods for counting wildebeest in images, and the processing of citizen science data.

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the text mentions assessing the deviation of each method from the single expert count, which is assumed to be the true number of wildebeest in each image. This suggests that some form of error calculation or metrics computation is performed to evaluate the performance of the citizen science and deep learning methods.

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on postprocessing steps. It is possible that additional processing steps are involved, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
