Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is detection. 

The context mentions that the model uses a Faster-RCNN backbone, which is a common architecture for object detection tasks. Additionally, the model is trained on a dataset of images and is evaluated using metrics such as recall, precision, and F-measure, which are typical evaluation metrics for object detection tasks. The context also mentions that the model is used for shark detection and classification, which further supports the conclusion that the purpose of the model is detection.
