Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the architecture employed is AlexNet, which is a type of CNN model. This is mentioned in the text as "This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep CNNs proposed by Krizhevsky et al. (2012)".
