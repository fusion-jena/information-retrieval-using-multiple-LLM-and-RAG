Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context where it is stated that "Huang and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs."
