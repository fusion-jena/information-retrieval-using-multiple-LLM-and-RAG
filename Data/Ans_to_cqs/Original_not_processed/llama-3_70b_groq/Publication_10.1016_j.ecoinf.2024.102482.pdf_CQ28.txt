Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for water quality monitoring, and the features used as input to the model. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
