Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context mentions facial recognition of sika deer, which implies that the input data is in the form of images. Additionally, the mention of computer vision techniques and the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet and DenseNet further supports this inference. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
