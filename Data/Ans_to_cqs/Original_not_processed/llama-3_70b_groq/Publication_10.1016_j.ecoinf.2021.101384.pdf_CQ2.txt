Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. However, it does mention that geospatial data are offered as standardized NetCDF files, and vessel data are aggregated at 0.01Â° resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. This suggests that the workflow may involve geospatial data in NetCDF format and possibly CSV or other formats for vessel data, but it does not provide information on the use of image, audio, or video data formats.
