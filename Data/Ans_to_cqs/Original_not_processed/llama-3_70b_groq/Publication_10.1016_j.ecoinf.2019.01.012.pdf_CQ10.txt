Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, and it provides details on the architecture and training of the model. However, it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
