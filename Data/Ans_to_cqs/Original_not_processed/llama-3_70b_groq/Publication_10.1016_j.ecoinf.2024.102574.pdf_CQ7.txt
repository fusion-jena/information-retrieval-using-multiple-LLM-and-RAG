Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, LiDAR, and UAV-based data, as well as forest ecology and carbon sequestration. It includes references to various studies and research papers, but none of them discuss the specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
