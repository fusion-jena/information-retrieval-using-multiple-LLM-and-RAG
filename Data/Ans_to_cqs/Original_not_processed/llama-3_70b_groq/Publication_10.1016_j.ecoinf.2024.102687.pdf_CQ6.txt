Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained CNN backbones and their comparative analysis for clustering quality improvement. It discusses the importance of fine-tuning the CNN backbone on the target dataset and the potential benefits of using features extracted from models trained on smaller, more specific datasets. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
