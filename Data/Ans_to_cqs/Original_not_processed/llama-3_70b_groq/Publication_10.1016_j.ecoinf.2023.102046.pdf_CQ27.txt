Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT) for image classification tasks, their architectures, and their performance on a specific dataset. It discusses the fine-tuning of these models, the optimizers used, and the learning rates, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
