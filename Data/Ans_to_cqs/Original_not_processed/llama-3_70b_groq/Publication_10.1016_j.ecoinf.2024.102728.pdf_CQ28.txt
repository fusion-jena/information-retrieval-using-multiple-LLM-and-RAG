Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. The context mentions various data sources, software, and tools used for the research, such as QGIS, TerrSet, and Litchi, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
