Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, drought characteristics, and groundwater assessment. It discusses various studies and techniques used in these areas, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
