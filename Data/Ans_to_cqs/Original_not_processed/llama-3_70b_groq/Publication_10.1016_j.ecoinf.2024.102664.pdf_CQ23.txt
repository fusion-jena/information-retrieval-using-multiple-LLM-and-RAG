Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the results of the models, including their RMSE values, and provides visualizations of the forecast results. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure the generalizability of the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
