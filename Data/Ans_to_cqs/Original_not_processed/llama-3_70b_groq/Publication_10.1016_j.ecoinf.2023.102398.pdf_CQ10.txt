Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about the YOLOv5 architecture, the SENet attention mechanism, and the training process, but it does not include a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not mentioned in the context.
