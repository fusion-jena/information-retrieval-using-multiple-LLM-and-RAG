Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is resizing the image patches to a uniform size of 256 × 256 pixels. This is mentioned in Section 2.6.4, "Model training with selected patches". Although the original images had different resolutions, such as 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, they were converted to a uniform size for training.

There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps were involved in the preprocessing of the data.
