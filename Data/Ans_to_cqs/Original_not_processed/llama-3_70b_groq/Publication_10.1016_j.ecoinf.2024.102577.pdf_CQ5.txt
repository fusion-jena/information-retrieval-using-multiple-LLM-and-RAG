Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a research article on machine learning in sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, and it lists various environmental and oceanographic variables, but it does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
