Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a section from a research paper discussing the use of random forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats. It cites several references and explains the methodology used, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
