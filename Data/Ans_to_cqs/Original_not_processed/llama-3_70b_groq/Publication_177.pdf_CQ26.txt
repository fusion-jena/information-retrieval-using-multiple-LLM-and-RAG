Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a "split balancing technique based on instance hardness" (sBal_IH) in one of the referenced papers [33]. This technique is used for classification in imbalanced datasets, which is a common issue related to data bias. 

Other than this, the context does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
