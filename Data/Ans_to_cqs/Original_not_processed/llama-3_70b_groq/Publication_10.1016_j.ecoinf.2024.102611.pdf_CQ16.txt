Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, distribution, and evaluation of the hierarchical classification model using a Random Forest classifier. It discusses the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, as well as the performance metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) used to evaluate the model. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
