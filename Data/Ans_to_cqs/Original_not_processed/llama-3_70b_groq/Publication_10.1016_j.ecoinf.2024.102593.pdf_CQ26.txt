Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance in the bioacoustics field, which can lead to data bias. 

It mentions active learning as a method to facilitate the labor-intensive process of data generation, which can help to address data imbalance. Additionally, it highlights the importance of accessing diverse datasets, such as those with geographically diverse origins, to reduce bias.

While it does not explicitly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it implies the need for diverse data collection and strategies to address data imbalance. Therefore, it can be inferred that these techniques might be relevant in this context, but it is not explicitly stated.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it hints at the importance of addressing data bias and imbalance through diverse data collection and active learning.
