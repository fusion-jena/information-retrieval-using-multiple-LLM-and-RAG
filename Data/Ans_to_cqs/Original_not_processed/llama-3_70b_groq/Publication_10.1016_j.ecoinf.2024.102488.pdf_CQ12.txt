Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The papers mentioned are related to remote sensing, gradient boosting, and feature selection, but there is no mention of a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context does mention the use of LightGBM, which is a gradient boosting framework, but it is not a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
