Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from remote sensing Earth observation data, specifically from satellite images. The text mentions "raster bands stack" which represents a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each containing information about different wavelengths. This suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite imagery.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. Additionally, the text does not explicitly mention the use of public datasets, although it is possible that the satellite imagery data is sourced from public datasets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery from remote sensing Earth observation data.
