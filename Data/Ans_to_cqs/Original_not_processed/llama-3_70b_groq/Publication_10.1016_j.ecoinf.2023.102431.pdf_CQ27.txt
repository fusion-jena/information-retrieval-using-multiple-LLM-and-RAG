Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the development of non-invasive survey methods for wildlife conservation. It provides information on the authors' contributions, methodology, and results, but does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
