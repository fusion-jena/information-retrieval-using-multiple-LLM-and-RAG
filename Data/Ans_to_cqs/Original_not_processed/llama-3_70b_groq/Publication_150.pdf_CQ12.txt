Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The models mentioned, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, are all variants of CNNs. These models are commonly used for image classification tasks, which is consistent with the mention of the ImageNet dataset in the context. There is no indication of the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the pipeline.
