Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is mentioned in the context as "The LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s architecture previously described."
