Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only discusses the training process of the YOLOv5 model, which involves iterative reduction of the loss function using a stochastic gradient algorithm. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
