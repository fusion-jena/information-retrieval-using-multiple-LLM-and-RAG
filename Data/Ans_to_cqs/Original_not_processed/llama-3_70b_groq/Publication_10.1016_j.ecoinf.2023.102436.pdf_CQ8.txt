Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to landscape planning, visualization, and ecology, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
