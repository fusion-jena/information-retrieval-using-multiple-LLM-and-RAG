Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM), environmental covariates, and bias correction methods, but it does not provide information about deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
