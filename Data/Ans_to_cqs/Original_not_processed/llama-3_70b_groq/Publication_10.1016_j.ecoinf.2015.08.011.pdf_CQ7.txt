Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study are not explicitly stated as a general rule or guideline. However, in the context of this specific study, the data was split into two sets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing (validation set). This split is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications, but the exact criteria for determining the proportion of data to allocate to each set are not provided.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Some common considerations include ensuring that the training set is representative of the overall data distribution, that the testing set is large enough to provide a reliable estimate of model performance, and that the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

In this study, the authors do not provide a detailed explanation of how they determined the 80-20 split, but it is likely that they used a random split, as mentioned in the text, to ensure that the training and validation sets are representative of the overall data distribution.
