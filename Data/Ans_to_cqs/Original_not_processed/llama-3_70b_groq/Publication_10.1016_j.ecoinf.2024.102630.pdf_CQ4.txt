Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, and their sources, strengths, and weaknesses. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision and deep learning applications. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
