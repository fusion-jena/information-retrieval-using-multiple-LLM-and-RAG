Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to land use/cover change, ecosystem services, and time series forecasting using LSTM models, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
