Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses the overall process, architecture, and components of the model, including the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), spectrogram data, and specific design choices for the downsampling blocks and classification block. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
