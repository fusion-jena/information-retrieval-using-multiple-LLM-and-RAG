Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the structure and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for anuran call classification. It discusses the data augmentation techniques and the splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
