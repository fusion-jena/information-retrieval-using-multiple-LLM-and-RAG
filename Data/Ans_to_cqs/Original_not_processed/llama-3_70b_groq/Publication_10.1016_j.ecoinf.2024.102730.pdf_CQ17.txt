Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is L2 regularization. This is mentioned in Table 2, which shows the explored ranges of hyperparameters used in the Optuna grid search. Specifically, the "Strength of the L2 regularization term" is listed as one of the hyperparameters, with a range of float values from 1e-4 to 1e-1 in logscale. 

There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may be used in the pipeline, but based on the available information, L2 regularization is the only one explicitly mentioned.
