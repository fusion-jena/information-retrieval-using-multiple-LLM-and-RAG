Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos, and it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this context is a collection of underwater videos, possibly obtained through underwater cameras or sensors. The context also mentions the creation of a thumbnail database, which suggests that the raw data might have been collected through video recordings.

It is also possible that public datasets or existing datasets related to underwater species recognition were used, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, but it can be inferred that underwater video recordings might have been used.
