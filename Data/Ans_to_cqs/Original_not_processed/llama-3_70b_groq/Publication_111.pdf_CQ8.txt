Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the deep learning model implementation is performed using Python programming language version 3.8.5, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
