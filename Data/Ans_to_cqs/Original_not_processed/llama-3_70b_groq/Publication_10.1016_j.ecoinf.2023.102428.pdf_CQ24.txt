Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be related to a research article about forest carbon sequestration mapping and economic quantification using machine learning and ecological informatics. It discusses the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Markov chain model, but it does not provide information about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
