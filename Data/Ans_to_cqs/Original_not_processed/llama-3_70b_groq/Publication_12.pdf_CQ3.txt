Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, and it discusses the architecture of the BatNet model and its optimization. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
