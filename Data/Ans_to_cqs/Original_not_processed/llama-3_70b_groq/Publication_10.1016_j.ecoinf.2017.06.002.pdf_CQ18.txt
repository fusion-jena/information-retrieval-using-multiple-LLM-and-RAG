Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model performance or training, nor does it provide any information about a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to metadata templates for measurement data, including installation details, measurement-specific details, and data file descriptions. It does not seem to be related to machine learning or model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
