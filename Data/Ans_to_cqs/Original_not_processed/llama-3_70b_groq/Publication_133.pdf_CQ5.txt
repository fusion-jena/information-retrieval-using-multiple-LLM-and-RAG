Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, there are some hints and references to datasets. For instance, the text mentions "trap images" and provides a link to a dataset repository (http://meshi1.cs.bgu.ac.il/FIE2020_data). Additionally, there is a reference to COCO dataset (https://cocodataset.org/#home) and YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0), which is a popular object detection model. It is likely that the dataset used is a custom dataset specific to insect images, but the exact name or details of the dataset are not provided.
