Answer: The context provided does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning models, including Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, but not a deep learning model. Therefore, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.

However, the context does provide information about the hyperparameters used in the LightGBM model, which is a type of gradient boosting framework. The hyperparameters used in LightGBM include:

* learning_rate
* max_depth
* bagging_fraction
* bagging_freq
* n_estimators

These hyperparameters control the algorithm and shape the structure of the leaves within the trees, influencing the model's complexity and efficiency.
