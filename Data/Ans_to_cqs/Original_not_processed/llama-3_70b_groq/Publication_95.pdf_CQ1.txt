Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline involves the use of sensors, specifically hyperspectral remote sensing. This is evident from the references to hyperspectral remote sensing in the context, such as in references 32 and 33, which discuss the benefits of hyperspectral remote sensing for tracking plant invasions and detecting invasive weeds.

Additionally, the context mentions image classification accuracy, which suggests that the raw data collected may be in the form of images. However, the specific method of collecting these images is not explicitly stated. It is possible that the images are collected through aerial or satellite imagery, but this is not explicitly mentioned.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary method of raw data collection in this deep learning pipeline is through the use of hyperspectral remote sensing and image data.
