Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the use of deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks, to generate high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) using Sentinel-2 optical images. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
