Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is early stopping. It is mentioned in the training setup section that "Early stopping was introduced to prevent overfitting when no further [progress] could be observed." This implies that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, which is a common criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it does not explicitly mention validation loss plateau as a criterion.
