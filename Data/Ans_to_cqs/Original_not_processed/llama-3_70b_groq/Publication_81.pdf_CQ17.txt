Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is Elastic Net. This is mentioned in the text as "To solve the overfitting problem in training process on small datasets is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model." 

It does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know if these methods are used in this specific pipeline, but Elastic Net is explicitly mentioned as a method to prevent overfitting.
