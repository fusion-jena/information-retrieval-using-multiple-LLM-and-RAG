Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the hyperparameters for each SDM (Species Distribution Model) are described in Table 3, but the table is not provided. Additionally, the context discusses the use of different models, such as MaxEnt, ANN, and deep neural networks, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
