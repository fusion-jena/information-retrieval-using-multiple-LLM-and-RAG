Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be discussing online repositories of biodiversity information, such as FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS, and how they can be used to analyze species occurrence data. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository, so it is not possible to determine where the code repository is located.
