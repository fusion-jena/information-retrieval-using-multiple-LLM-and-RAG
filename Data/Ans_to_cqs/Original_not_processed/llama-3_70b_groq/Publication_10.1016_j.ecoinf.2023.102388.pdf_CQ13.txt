Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned in the provided context. 

For the no-overfitting setting, the optimization algorithm is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, and the number of training epochs is 200. Additionally, batch-norm and dropout (0.5) are used to reduce overfitting.

For the overfitting setting, the same hyperparameters are used as in the no-overfitting setting, but without batch-norm, weight decay, and dropout.

In another context, the optimization algorithm is also Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) but with a momentum of 0.9. The learning rate is set to 0.001, the batch size is 32, and a decay of 0.5 is applied every 512 iterations, summing up to a total of 2048 iterations.

Note that the hyperparameters may vary depending on the specific model and setting.
