Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context only mentions the use of deep learning techniques in smart farming systems and ecological monitoring, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
