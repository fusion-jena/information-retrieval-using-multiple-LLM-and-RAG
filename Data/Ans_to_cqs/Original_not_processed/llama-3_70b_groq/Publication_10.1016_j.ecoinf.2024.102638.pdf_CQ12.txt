Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer being used in the pipeline. The mentioned models are XGB, SVR, MLP, KNN, GP, TREE, and RF, which are not deep learning models. MLP is a feed-forward neural network, but it is not a deep learning model in the sense of CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, the answer is that the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified or mentioned.
