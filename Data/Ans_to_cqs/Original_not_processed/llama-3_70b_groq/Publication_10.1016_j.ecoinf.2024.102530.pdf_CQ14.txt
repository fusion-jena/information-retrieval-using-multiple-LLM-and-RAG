Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the InVEST pollination model, its components, and related studies, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
