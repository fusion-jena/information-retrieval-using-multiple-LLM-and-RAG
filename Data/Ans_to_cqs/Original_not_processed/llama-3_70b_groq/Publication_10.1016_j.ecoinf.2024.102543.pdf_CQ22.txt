Answer:::

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Precision (Prec.)
2. Mean Average Precision (mAP) - which considers both precision and recall. It has two variants: mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95.
3. Parameters (Params) - which refers to the number of learned variables used for making predictions, and is an essential metric for evaluating the model's complexity and computational efficiency.
4. Floating-Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs) - which measures how many floating-point arithmetic operations a model can perform per second, and is a hardware-dependent measure.
5. Inference Time (Inf.) - which measures the speed at which the model processes input data and produces output predictions.
6. Time taken for training (Time) - which measures how long it takes for the model to learn from the training data and improve its accuracy.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its accuracy, complexity, computational efficiency, and speed.
