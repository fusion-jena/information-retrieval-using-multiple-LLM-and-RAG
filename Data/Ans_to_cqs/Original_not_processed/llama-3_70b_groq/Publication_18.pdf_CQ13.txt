Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to deep neural networks, object detection, and image classification, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a specific model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
