Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of autoencoders and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating aquatic ecosystem health, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
