Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics related to ecological informatics, including wildfire susceptibility mapping and forest fires. It cites several references and includes tables and figures, but it does not provide information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
