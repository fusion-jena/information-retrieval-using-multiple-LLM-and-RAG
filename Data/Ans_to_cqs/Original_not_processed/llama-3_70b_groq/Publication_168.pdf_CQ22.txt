Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). These metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate the classification performance of the model. 

Specifically, OA represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples in the total samples, AA represents the average of each category classification accuracies, and Kappa coefficient is used to measure the consistency of classification accuracy. 

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context.
