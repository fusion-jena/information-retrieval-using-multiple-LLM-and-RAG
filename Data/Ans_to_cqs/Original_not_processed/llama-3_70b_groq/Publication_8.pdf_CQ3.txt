Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model was trained on 653 annotated images and later evaluated on an un-annotated independent dataset. It also mentions the use of Faster R-CNN, which is a common object detection architecture that typically uses bounding box annotations. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation might be one of the annotation techniques used in this pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques.
