Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on a cellular automaton model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation, and its application to a real wildfire case. It discusses the model's parameters, modifications, and potential improvements, but does not touch on the deployment of a deep learning model.
