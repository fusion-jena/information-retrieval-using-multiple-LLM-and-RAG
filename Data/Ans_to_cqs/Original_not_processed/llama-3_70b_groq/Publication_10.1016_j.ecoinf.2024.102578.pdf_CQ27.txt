Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the workflow performance, the multi-step semi-automated workflow, and the training of the ResNet-50 model using the keras package in R. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
