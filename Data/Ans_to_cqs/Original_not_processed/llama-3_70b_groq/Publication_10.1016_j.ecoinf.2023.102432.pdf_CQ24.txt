Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses Random Forest, a machine learning approach, and its application in remote sensing for classification. It also compares Random Forest with MTMI-SMF, another machine learning approach. The context does not provide any information about deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
