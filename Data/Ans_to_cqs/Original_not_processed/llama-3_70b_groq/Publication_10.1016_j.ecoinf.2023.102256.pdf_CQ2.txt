Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is spectrograms, which are a visual representation of audio signals. This is evident from Figure 1, which shows an example of spectrograms recorded for two species of birds. The baseline model takes a spectrogram input and produces a probability for each of the 22 species. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
