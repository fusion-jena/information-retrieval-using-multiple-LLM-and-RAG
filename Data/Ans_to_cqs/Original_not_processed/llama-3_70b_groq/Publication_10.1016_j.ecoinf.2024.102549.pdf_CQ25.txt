Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. The model is designed to classify input images into three water-quality level labels: Class I, Class II, and Class III. The model architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which are typical components of a classification model. The model is trained to learn features from the input images and output a probability distribution over the three classes, allowing it to predict the water quality level of a given image.
