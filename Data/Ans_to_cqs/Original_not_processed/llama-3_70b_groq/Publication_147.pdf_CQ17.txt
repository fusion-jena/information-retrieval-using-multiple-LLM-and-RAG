Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and XGBoost for wetland classification, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the use of a combination of binary cross-entropy and dice coefficient loss as the objective loss function for training the CNN model. This loss function combination may help to some extent in preventing overfitting, but it is not a traditional regularization method.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
