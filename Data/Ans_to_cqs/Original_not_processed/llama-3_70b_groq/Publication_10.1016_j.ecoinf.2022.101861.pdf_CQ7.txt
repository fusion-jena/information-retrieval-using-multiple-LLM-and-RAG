Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the use of Kaleidoscope Pro, an automated signal recognition software, to analyze acoustic datasets and extract sounds of interest based on specific parameters. It also mentions the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks in future studies, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
