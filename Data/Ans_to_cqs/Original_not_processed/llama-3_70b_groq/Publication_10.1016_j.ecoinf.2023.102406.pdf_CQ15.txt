Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on random forests, a type of machine learning algorithm, and discusses topics such as bagging, tree averaging, and parameter tuning. It does not provide information on deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
