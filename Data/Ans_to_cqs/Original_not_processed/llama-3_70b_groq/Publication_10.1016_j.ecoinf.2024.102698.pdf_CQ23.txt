Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the use of various deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for learning sophisticated patterns in data. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
