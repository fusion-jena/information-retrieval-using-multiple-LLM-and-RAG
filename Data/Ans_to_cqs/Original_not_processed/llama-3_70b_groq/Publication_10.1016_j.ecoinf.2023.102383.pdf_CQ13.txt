Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, specifically the ResNet family of models, and how they are used for object detection tasks. It discusses the feature pyramid network (FPN) and how it can be used to improve object detection, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
