Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on the different machine learning models, their architectures, and their performance metrics (R, RMSE, MAPE) during training and testing phases. 

However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps, as the context provides various performance metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE for different models. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps are involved or not. 

In summary, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is metrics calculation, but other steps like saliency maps and confusion matrices are not mentioned.
