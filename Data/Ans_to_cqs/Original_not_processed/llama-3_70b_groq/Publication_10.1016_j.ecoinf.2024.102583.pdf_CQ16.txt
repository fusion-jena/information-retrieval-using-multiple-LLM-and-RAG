Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the features and advantages of the XGBoost model, the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model, and the landslide susceptibility maps consistency analysis. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, or a predetermined number of epochs. However, this information is not provided in the given context.
