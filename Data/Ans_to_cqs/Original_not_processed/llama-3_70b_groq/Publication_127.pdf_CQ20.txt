Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses various deep learning architectures, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, and provides references to research papers and conferences. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
