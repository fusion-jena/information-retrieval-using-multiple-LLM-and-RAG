Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the classification process, feature extraction, and the proposed framework for automatic annotation of coral reefs.

However, it can be inferred that the authors have used a pre-trained VGGnet model, which was fine-tuned on the Benthoz15 dataset. This implies that the dataset was likely preprocessed before training the model, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning the data. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves resizing the input images to a fixed size, which is often required for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Cleaning the data involves removing noise, handling missing values, and correcting errors in the dataset.

However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular study.
