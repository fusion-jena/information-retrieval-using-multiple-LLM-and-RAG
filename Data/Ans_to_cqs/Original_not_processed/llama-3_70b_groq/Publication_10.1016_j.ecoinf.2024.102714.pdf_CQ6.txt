Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on habitat classification, mapping, and accuracy assessment using machine learning models, specifically the XGBoostClassifier.

However, it can be inferred that the input features used in the XGBoostClassifier include seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2, backscatter composites from Sentinel-1, elevation, and slope, totaling up to 54 features (Appendix-A). These features are likely to be used as input to the model without explicit preprocessing steps mentioned.

It is common practice in machine learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what specific preprocessing steps were involved before training the XGBoostClassifier model.
