Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, its performance, and the dataset used for training, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
