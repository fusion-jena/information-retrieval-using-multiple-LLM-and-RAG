Answer::: 

The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is RMSprop, which is an unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton. This is mentioned in the context as the optimizer used with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. There is no mention of other optimization techniques like SGD or Adam in the provided context.
