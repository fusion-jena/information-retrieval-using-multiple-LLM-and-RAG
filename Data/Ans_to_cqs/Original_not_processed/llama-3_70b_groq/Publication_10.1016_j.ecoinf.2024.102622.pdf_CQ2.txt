Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based. There are multiple references to remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, and UAV multispectral images, which suggest that image data is being used. Additionally, there are mentions of hyperspectral imaging technology and colour images, which further support the idea that image data is being utilized.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to CSV data in the context of crop type classification, which suggests that CSV files may be used as an input or output format for certain models.

It's worth noting that the context provided is focused on remote sensing and agricultural applications, so it's possible that other data formats may be used in different domains or applications. However, based on the information provided, it appears that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline.
