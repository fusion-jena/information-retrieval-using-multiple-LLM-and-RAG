Answer::: 
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Optuna, a Bayesian optimization library. Specifically, Optuna is used to optimize the structure and hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. For the LightGBM models, Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integration.lightgbm) is used for hyperparameter fitting. The parameters and ranges used for optimization are shown in Table 1.
