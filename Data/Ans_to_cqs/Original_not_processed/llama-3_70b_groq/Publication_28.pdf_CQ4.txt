Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of various deep learning models, including PTDLEN-VAE, CNN-RBFNN, CA-CNN-BiLSTM, and others, on the AIM dataset. It also explains the architecture of the VAE model and the EfficientNet framework. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
