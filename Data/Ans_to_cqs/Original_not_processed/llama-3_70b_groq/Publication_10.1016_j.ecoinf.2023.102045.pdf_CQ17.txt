Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and mapping, but it does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context discusses the importance of considering color vision deficiency in scientific visualization, particularly in mapping, and references various studies and tools related to this topic. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
