Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is manual annotation through crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users. This is mentioned in the text by Sharma et al. (2017), where they utilized crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes.

There is no mention of specific techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is suggested that a user interface for easily marking desired components could be a future perspective for a more versatile removal of components.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that manual annotation through crowd-sourcing is the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific techniques mentioned in the query (bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not mentioned in the provided context.
