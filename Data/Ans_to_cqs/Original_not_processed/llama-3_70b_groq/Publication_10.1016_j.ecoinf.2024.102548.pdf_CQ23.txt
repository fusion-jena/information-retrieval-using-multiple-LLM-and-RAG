Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on explaining the importance of total model parameters, total layers in the model, and the fine-tuning process of pre-trained models. It also presents the results of various models on a specific classification task, including their accuracy, loss, and training time.

However, it can be inferred that the study experiments were designed to ensure comparability and standardization across all models, as mentioned in section 5.1.5. This might imply that some measures were taken to ensure generalizability, but the specific details are not provided.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
