Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of machine learning models for wildlife monitoring and data labeling, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. The references cited in the article are mostly other research papers and articles, and none of them seem to be related to a data repository. Therefore, I couldn't find any information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
