Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does mention the metrics calculation step.

According to the context, after model training, the performance of the model is assessed using the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation. The following metrics are calculated for model performance: the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps are involved in the postprocessing phase.
