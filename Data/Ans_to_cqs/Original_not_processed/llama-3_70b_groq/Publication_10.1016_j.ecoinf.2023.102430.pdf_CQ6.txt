Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only discusses the implementation of the algorithms, the training and testing process, and the performance of the models, but it does not provide information about the preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
