Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This is mentioned in the text as a classic deep learning model extensively utilized for image processing. Additionally, the context mentions that DCNN can effectively extract ecological information from camera trap images, including species labels, counts, and behaviors. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific architecture of the DCNN used in the pipeline.
