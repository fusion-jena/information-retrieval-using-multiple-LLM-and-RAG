Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of residual networks, convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
