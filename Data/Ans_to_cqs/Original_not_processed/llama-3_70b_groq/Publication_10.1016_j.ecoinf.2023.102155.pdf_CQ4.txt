Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, nor does it mention a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing intensity maps, lasso regularization, bias correction, and performance measures such as meanRSS, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
