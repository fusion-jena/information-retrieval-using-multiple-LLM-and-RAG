Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The references cited are academic papers and datasets, but there is no mention of a specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
