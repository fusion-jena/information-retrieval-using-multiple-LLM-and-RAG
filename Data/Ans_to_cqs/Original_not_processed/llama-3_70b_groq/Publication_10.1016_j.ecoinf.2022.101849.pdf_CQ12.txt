Answer: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a feed-forward neural network. This is mentioned in section 1.1 of the provided context, which describes the architecture of the neural network used for predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. The architecture consists of three layers: an input layer with 47 neurons, a hidden layer with 40 neurons and sigmoid activation functions, and an output layer with 13 neurons and a softmax function to ensure the outputs sum up to unity.
