Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and provides information on various climate variables (BIOCLIM) and references to research papers on species distribution modeling and semi-supervised learning. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
