Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically ResNet50, for bioacoustic tasks and species identification. It discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, as well as the architecture of the implemented model. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
