Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text appears to be discussing a monitoring program for the dive community, citizen science, and data quality, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
