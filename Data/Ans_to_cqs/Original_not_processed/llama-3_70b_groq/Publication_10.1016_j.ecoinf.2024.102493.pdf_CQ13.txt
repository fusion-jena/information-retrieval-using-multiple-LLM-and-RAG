Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses the use of the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) and its application in studying vegetation growth, as well as the geographical detector (Geodetector) method for analyzing the spatial patterns of kNDVI. It also explains the calculation of the Q value, which represents the explanatory power of each driver factor on the spatial variability of the kNDVI. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer.
