Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to environmental and sustainability topics, including water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment. There is a mention of a neural network model being used to predict GHGdwts (greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment) with input factors of population size and GDP, but it does not specify a particular dataset used for training or testing the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
