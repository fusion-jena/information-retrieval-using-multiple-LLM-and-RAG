Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be discussing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and their application to classify blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. It does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
