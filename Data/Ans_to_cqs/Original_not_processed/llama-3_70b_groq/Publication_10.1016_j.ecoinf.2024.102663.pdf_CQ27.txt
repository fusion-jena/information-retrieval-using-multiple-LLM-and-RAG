Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the potential of deep learning techniques in preprocessing and improving fish biomass estimates, and it presents various figures comparing different hyperparameters and optimizers. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
