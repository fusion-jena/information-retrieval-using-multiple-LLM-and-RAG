Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the classification network, the evaluation metrics, and the comparison of different methods for bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection. 

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training and testing the models is the VnPollenBee dataset, which is not a publicly available dataset. The context does not provide information on how this dataset was collected or what methods were used to gather the raw data. 

It is possible that the dataset was collected using sensors, such as cameras, or other monitoring systems, but this is not explicitly stated in the context. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
