Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of Bayesian optimization for tuning model hyperparameters and environmental cross-validation with ten folds to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the models. This suggests that the authors took measures to ensure the generalizability of their models by using cross-validation, which helps to prevent overfitting and evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. The focus of the context is on tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the predictive accuracy of the models using environmental cross-validation.
