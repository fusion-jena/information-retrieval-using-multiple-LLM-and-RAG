Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a snippet from a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, and it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. The context includes some mathematical equations and notation, but it does not provide any information related to the query.

The query asks about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout and L2 regularization, but the context does not provide any information about these topics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
