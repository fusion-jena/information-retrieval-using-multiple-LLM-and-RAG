Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It mentions the use of machine learning models (MLMs) and ensemble modeling, but it does not provide details about the specific type of deep learning model used. The context only mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) as one of the MLMs, but it does not provide information about the other MLMs used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
