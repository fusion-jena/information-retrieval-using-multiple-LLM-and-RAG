Answer:::
The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in wildlife conservation, specifically in aerial surveys for wildlife population estimation. It mentions the use of a deep learning model called HerdNet3, which is a single-stage fully convolutional neural network designed for animal detection and classification in aerial survey images. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used to train or test this model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
