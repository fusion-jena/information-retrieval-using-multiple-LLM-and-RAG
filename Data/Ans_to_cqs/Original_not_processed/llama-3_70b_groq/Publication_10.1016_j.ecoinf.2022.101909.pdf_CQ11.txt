Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning with the ResNet50 model, pre-trained on ImageNet data, and mentions various papers and datasets related to bioacoustic tasks, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
