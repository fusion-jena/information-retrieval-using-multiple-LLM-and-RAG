Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and its parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, but it does not specify the optimization technique used to update these parameters.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the "decay" parameter, which is often used in optimization techniques such as SGD with decay or Adam to regularize the learning rate. But without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific optimization technique used in the pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
