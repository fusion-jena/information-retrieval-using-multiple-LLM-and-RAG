Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the experimental setting, training of the bird sound noise reduction network, and comparison with other algorithms, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
