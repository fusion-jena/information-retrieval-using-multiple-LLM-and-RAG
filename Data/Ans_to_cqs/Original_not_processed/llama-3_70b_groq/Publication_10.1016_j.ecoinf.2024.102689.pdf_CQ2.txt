Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that various data formats are used in deep learning pipelines. 

Image data is used in several studies, such as fish recognition in underwater environments (Laplante et al., 2021), underwater target detection (Lei et al., 2022), and fish classification (Salman, 2017). 

Audio data is also used, as seen in fish recognition in underwater environments using deep learning and audio data (Laplante et al., 2021). 

Video data is used in studies such as detecting, tracking, and counting fish in low-quality unconstrained underwater videos (Spampinato et al., 2008) and feeding action recognition from underwater videos in aquaculture (Måløy et al., 2019).

There is no explicit mention of CSV data format being used in the provided context. However, it is possible that CSV files might be used as an intermediate format for storing and processing data, but this is not explicitly stated.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are image, audio, and video data.
