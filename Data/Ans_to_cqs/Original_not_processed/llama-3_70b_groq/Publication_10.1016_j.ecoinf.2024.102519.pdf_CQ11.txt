Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link associated with it. The context appears to be related to a research study that uses various datasets, including DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, and meteorological data, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The links provided in the context are related to data sources, such as the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, but they do not seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline.
