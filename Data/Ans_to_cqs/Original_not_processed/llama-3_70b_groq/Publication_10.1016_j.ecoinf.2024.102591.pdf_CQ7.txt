Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) wildfire events, the FIREMAP burned area product, and the PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL models. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes.

However, we can infer that the data was split into training and validation sets based on the labels provided in Table 1. The "training" label is assigned to some wildfire events, while the "validation" label is assigned to others. This suggests that the data was split into two sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not provided.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and we can only infer that the data was split into training and validation sets based on the labels provided in Table 1.
