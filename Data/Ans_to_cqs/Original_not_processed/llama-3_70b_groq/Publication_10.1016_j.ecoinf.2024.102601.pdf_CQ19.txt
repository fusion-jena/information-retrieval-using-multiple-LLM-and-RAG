Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention the use of deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions the use of the scikit-learn library for hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and for building a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. There is no indication of the use of deep learning models or frameworks.
