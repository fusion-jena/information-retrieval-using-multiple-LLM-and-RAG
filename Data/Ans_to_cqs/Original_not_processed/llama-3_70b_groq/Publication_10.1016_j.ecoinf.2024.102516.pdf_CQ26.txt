Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the network setup, training, and comparison with a baseline model for plant species cover estimation. It discusses the use of data augmentation, specifically horizontal flipping, but does not mention other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
