Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions "neural networks" and "animal detection model" but does not specify the architecture or type of model used. It does reference some papers and articles related to deep learning, such as Scaled-YOLOv4 and MobileNetV3, but these are not explicitly stated to be part of the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
