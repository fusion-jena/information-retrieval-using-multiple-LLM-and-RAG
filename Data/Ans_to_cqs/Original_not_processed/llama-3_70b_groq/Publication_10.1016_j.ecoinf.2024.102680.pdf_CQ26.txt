Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is mosaic data augmentation. This is mentioned in section 2.2.1, which states that the input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations on the initial images, including applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. This suggests that the authors are using mosaic data augmentation to make the distribution of the input data more uniform and enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, thereby improving the model performance during training.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these techniques are used in this specific deep learning pipeline.
