Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the tuning of hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the trained model is used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data. This suggests that the model is used to make predictions on new input data, but the context does not provide information on how the performance of the model is evaluated or what postprocessing steps are involved.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the context.
