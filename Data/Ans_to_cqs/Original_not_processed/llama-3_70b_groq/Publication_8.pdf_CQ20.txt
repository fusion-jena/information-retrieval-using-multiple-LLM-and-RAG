Answer: The hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), specifically a TITAN Xp. This is mentioned in the context as "a minibatch size of four images per GPU (TITAN Xp) was selected for training the model." Additionally, it is mentioned that the model was trained on a single GPU for 9000 iterations and then trained again on three GPUs for 18000 iterations.
