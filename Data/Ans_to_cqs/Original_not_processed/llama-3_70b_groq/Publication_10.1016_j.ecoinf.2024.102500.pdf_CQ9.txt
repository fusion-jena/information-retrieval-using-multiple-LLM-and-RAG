Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models for water quality prediction, but it does not provide information about the availability of the data repository. The references cited are academic papers and do not seem to be related to data repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
