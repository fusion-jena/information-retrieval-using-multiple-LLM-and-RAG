Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the data collection and sampling process used in the study.

The study deviated from the traditional approach of generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, it used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of sampling plots, from which training and validation points were collected. This approach helped ensure that the training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

Additionally, the study addressed the issue of an unbalanced training set by creating a separate geometry, 'add trees', which added well-defined examples of woody cover elements until the two classes had the same number of training points. This new geometry was then merged with the randomly allocated woody points.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does describe a form of data collection that aims to ensure diversity and balance in the training data. However, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and it is unclear whether other techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
