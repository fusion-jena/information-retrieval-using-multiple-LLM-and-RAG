Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using a combination of satellite imagery and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Specifically, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 optical images, Landsat 8 OLI imagery, and GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data.

GEDI is a LiDAR instrument that provides high-resolution 3D data on forest structure and canopy height. The context suggests that GEDI data is fused with passive optical images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI to create a high-resolution CHM (Canopy Height Model) of the Earth.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms to compute and derive a global forest canopy height map at 30m spatial resolution, which suggests that the raw data is processed and analyzed using machine learning techniques.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used as a source of raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that other data sources may be used in the pipeline that are not mentioned in the provided context.
