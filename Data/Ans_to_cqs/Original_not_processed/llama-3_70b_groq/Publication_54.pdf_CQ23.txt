Answer::: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the endemic bird data was randomly split into training and testing datasets, which helps to prevent overfitting and allows the model to generalize well to new, unseen data. 

Secondly, the training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. This augmentation helps to increase the diversity of the training dataset, which in turn improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Thirdly, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation. This split allows the model to be fine-tuned and validated on a separate dataset, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well.

Lastly, five-fold cross-validation was employed to verify the predictive performance of the model. Cross-validation is a technique that involves training and evaluating the model on multiple subsets of the data, which helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a particular subset of the data.

Overall, these measures help to ensure that the deep learning model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data and is not overfitting to the training dataset.
