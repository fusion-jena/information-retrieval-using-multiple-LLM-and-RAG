Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a snippet from a research article or paper, and it does not provide any information about the code repository. The context mentions the journal homepage, article information, and references, but it does not include any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
