Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model selection procedure, model architectures, and their performance. It discusses the data partitioning, training, and validation processes, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
