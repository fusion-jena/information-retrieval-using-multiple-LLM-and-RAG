Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting plant disease severity and forecasting disease incidence. It mentions the use of various weather parameters and machine learning models such as bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and artificial neural network, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
