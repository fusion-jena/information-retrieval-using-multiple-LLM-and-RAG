Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only provides information about the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in the model, including the types of layers, their shapes, and the number of parameters. It also provides information about the supplementary materials, such as Mathematica notebooks and PDF files, that contain the code used to define and train the CNNs. However, the hyperparameters used in the model are not specified.
