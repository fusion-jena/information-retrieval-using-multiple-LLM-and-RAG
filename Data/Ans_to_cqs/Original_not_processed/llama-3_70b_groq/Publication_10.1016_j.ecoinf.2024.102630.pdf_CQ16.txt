Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically discussing forest area, grassland area, cropland area, and orchard area over different time periods. There is no mention of training, validation loss, or plateau, which are terms typically associated with machine learning and model training. Therefore, I cannot determine the criteria used to determine when training is complete based on the provided context.
