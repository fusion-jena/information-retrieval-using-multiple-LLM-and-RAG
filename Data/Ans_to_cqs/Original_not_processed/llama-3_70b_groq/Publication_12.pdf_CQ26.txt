Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, and it does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of batch normalization (BNorm layers) to prevent overfitting, which can be related to addressing data bias. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a large batch size (128) to train the model, which might have implications for data bias. Nevertheless, it does not provide explicit information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
