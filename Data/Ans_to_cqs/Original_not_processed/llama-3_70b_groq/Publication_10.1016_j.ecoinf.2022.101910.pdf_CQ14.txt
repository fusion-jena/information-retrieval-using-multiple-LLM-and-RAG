Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold are set to specific values (1.5, 1.5 s, and 0.4, respectively) in BirdNET, but it does not explain how these values were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
