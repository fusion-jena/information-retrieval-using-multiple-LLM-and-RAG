Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing soil nutrient concentration analysis using various machine learning and statistical methods, including PLSR, RF, CWT, LASSO, CNN, SPA, WAPLSR, and MARS. The context provides tables and equations related to the analysis, but it does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
