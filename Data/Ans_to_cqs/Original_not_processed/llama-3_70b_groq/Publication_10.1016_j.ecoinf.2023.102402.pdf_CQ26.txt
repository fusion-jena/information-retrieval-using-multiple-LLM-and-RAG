Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological niche modeling, and bioclimatic modeling, with mentions of algorithms such as Maxent, Biomod2, and sdm. 

However, it does mention that the method used (presumably Maxent) "may be considered an excellent method to cope with imbalanced-biased data in species distribution modelling approaches" (Ahmadi et al., 2023). This suggests that the method is capable of handling imbalanced or biased data, but it does not specify the techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
