Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and atmospheric correction, citing various research papers and algorithms, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
