Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the machine learning methodology, specifically the use of random forest models and the repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

However, it can be inferred that the repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach might help to reduce the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. But, it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
