Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the design of a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance, specifically using honey bee flight activity data and a recurrent neural network model. It discusses the data collection process, performance metrics, and hyperparameters used for training the model, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
