Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The only mention of code is in the sentence "To make these methods more accessible, we published the data used in this study, the code used in the analysis, and the trained machine learning model." However, it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
