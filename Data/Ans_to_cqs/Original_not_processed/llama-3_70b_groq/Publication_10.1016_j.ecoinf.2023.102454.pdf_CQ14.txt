Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be discussing a study on carbon emissions and energy consumption in Xi'an, China, and provides information on the study area, data sources, and a formula for calculating carbon emissions. However, it does not provide any information on the optimization of hyperparameters in a model.
