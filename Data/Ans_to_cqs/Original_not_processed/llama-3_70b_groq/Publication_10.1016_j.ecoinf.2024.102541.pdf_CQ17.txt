Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various deep learning models and techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), single shot detectors, YOLOv5, and residual networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.

Although the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it is worth noting that regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.

Since the context does not provide specific information about regularization methods, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
