Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Aerial images: As mentioned in the context, aerial images were used to collect data for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect whales.
2. Satellite imagery: The context mentions the use of satellite imagery, specifically high-resolution satellite imagery, for collecting data.
3. Public datasets: Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that public datasets are used, as the context mentions the use of ImageNet, a large public dataset, for image classification tasks.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation and transfer learning to boost the learning of CNNs on small datasets, which implies that the collection of raw data is an important step in the deep learning pipeline.

It is also important to note that the context is limited, and it may not provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, it is possible that other methods, such as surveys or sensors, may be used in certain deep learning pipelines, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
