Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and instructions for setting up a CUDA-capable Virtual Machine instance on Google Cloud for running deep learning models, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
