Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and materials used in the study, including the EfficientNet model, data augmentation, and evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
