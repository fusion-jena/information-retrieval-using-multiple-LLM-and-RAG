Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for semantic segmentation of nadir photographs to estimate boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition. It discusses the challenges of class imbalance in the dataset and the limitations of manual segmentation, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
