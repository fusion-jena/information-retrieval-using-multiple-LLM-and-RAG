Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. The training and validation set are divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation method, in which nine of the parts are used as a training set and one is used for the validation set. The validation set is a set of samples set aside separately during the model training, which can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the model's capabilities. This approach helps to monitor the model's performance during training and prevents overfitting.
