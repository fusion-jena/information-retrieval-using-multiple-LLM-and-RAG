Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms using Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GSCV) and provides a table listing the tuned parameters for each algorithm. It does not delve into the preprocessing steps required for deep learning models.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data for training, improve model performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance.

Normalization involves scaling numeric values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming numeric values to a common scale, often using techniques like standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming categorical variables into a suitable format for the model.

While these preprocessing steps are essential for deep learning models, the provided context does not provide specific information about them.
