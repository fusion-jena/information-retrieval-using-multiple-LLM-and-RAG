Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from existing datasets, specifically the Sparrow population dataset, and two simulated datasets from Matthiopoulos et al. (2011) and Matthiopoulos et al. (2015). There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used to collect raw data. The context suggests that the focus is on analyzing and modeling existing datasets rather than collecting new data. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the data is sourced from existing datasets.
