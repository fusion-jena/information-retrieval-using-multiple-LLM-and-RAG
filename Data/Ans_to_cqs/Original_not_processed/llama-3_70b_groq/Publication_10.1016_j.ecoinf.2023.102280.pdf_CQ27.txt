Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning-based denoising methods to bioacoustics, the challenges of applying these methods to bioacoustics, and the methodology pipeline for noise reduction and deep audio enhancement models. However, it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
