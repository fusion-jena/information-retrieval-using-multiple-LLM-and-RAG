Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics related to machine learning, neural networks, and remote sensing, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
