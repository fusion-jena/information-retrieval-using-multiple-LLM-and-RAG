Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The text only mentions that the authors did not use an image recognition model (e.g., deep learning) due to the limited geographical area and the subsequent limited volume of data. It does not provide information about the datasets used in the study.
