Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of decision trees, bootstrap forest partitioning, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression, but it does not mention any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
