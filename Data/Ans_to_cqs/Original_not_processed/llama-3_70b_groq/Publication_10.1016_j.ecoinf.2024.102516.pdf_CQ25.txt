Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation, specifically for plant species identification and plant cover prediction. The model is trained in three phases, where the first phase involves classification training to predict plant species, and the second phase uses the generated segmentation maps to train a segmentation network. The final phase can be used to either train a plant cover prediction network or generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations. The model aims to identify and segment plant species in images, including their blossoms and leaves, to ultimately predict plant cover.
