Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses various algorithms and models used for water quality prediction, including deep learning algorithms, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or its repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
