Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the values of certain hyperparameters, such as batch size, momentum, L2 weight decay penalty multiplier, and dropout ratio, but it does not explain how these values were chosen. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or some other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
