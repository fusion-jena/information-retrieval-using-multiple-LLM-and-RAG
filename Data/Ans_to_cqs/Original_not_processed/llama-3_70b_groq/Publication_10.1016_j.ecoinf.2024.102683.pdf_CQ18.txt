Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is by tracking the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score at different epochs. This is evident from Fig. 8, which reports the performance of the presented models in different epochs. The figure shows how the performance of the models increases with the number of epochs and the number of training data. This suggests that the model performance is being monitored and evaluated during training by tracking these metrics at each epoch.
