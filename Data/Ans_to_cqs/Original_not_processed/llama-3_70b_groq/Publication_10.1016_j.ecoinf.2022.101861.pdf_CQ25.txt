Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of the provided papers is classification. Specifically, it is used for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. This is mentioned in the paper by LeBien et al. (2020), which describes a pipeline for identification of bird and frog species using a convolutional neural network. The model is trained to classify audio recordings into different species based on their acoustic characteristics.
