Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The experiment section mentions that the model was trained and evaluated on a test set using metrics like accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular experiment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
