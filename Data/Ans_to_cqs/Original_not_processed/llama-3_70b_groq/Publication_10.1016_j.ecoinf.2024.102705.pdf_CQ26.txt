Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Reducing bias in density estimates for unmarked populations that exhibit reactive behaviour towards camera traps" in the paper by Delisle et al. (2023). This suggests that bias reduction is an important consideration in certain applications of deep learning, but the specific techniques used to address bias are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
