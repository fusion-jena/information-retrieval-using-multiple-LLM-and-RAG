Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to recognize fish in images. 

Specifically, the F-measure is used as the primary metric, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F-measure is calculated as the weighted average of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. 

In Table 3, the precision, recall, and F-measure are reported for the deep learning model on four test videos. The F-measure is also compared with the HOG+SVM method in Table 4, showing that the deep learning model outperforms the HOG+SVM method. 

Additionally, the ROC curves are provided in Figure 6, which show the performance of the deep learning model at different thresholds. However, accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as a metric in this context.
