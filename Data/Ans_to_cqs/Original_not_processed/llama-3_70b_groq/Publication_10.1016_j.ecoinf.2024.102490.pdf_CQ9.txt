Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, plant diversity, and species occurrence records, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. The mentioned databases and repositories, such as SpeciesLink, Reflora-Virtual Herbarium, and GBIF, are related to species occurrence records and biodiversity information, but they are not associated with a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
