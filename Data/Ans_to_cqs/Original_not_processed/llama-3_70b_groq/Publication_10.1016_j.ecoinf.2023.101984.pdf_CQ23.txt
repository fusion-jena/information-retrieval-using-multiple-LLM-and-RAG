Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It appears to be discussing a MaxEnt model, which is a type of species distribution model. The context mentions that the MaxEnt model's output was analyzed, and the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the model were estimated.

To ensure the generalizability of the MaxEnt model, the context mentions that 10 replicate runs were performed, and the results were averaged. Additionally, a 30% random test percentage was used, which suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate test dataset. However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset.

It is also worth noting that the context provides information on the permutation importance of the variables, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated by randomly permuting the values of each variable and measuring the resulting drop in training AUC. This is a common technique for evaluating the importance of variables in a model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does suggest that some form of evaluation was performed using a separate test dataset and permutation importance. However, without more information, it is difficult to say whether the model was properly validated or whether other measures were taken to ensure its generalizability.
