Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and their application in estimating the distribution of invasive species, with discussions on data preparation, model evaluation, and testing. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
