Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through field data and remotely sensed optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) datasets. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection. The field data is collected using 196 sample plots, as shown in Fig. 3b. The remotely sensed data is likely collected through satellite or aerial imagery. However, the exact methods or sources of the remotely sensed data are not specified in the provided context.
