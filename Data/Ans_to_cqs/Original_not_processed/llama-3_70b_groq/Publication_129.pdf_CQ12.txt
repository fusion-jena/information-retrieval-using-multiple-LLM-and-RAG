Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is evident from the mention of specific CNN architectures such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), and Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet) in the text. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a feature extractor network, which are common components of CNN-based object detection pipelines. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer models in the provided context.
