Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methods used in designing a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance, including data collection, performance metrics, and hyperparameters used for training the Recurrent Neural Network model. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted or made available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository used (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
