Answer: The provided context does not mention deep learning or any regularization methods commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on statistical modeling and estimation, specifically in the context of species distribution models.

However, it does mention the use of an L1 penalty in the penalized loss function (Equation 5) for shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This is a form of regularization, but it is not specific to deep learning.

In summary, the context does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, but it does mention the use of an L1 penalty for regularization in a statistical modeling context.
