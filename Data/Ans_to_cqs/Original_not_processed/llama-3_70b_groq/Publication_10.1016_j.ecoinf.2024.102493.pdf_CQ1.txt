Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from remote sensing products and public datasets. Specifically, the study utilizes the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to acquire NDVI data. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 16 days. The study collects original images of the study area spanning from January 2001 to December 2020, totaling 460 images. Additionally, the study uses a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) to derive terrain-related drivers such as elevation, slope, and aspect. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data.
