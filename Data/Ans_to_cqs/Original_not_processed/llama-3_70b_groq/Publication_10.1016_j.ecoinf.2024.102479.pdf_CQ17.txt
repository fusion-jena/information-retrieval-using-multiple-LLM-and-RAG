Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Penalized regression" as one of the algorithms used in the study, which is a type of regularization method. 

LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, which is a type of penalized regression, is mentioned in the context as a reference. LASSO regression is a regularization method that adds a penalty term to the loss function to reduce the magnitude of the model's coefficients, which can help prevent overfitting.

However, the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used regularization methods in deep learning. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these methods were used in the study.

In summary, while the context mentions penalized regression, which is a type of regularization method, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
