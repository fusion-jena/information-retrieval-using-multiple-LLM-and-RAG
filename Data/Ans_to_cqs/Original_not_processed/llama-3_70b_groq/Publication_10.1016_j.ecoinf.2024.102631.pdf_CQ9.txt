Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It describes the architecture and performance of the model, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
