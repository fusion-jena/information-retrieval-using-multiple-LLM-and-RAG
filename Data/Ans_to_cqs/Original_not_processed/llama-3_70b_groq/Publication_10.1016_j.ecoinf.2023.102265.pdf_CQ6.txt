Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different ResNet models and their performance in feature extraction and classification tasks. It discusses the training times, validation accuracies, and the visualization of extracted features using a t-SNE algorithm. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
