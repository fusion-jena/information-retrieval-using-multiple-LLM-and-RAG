Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not delve into the specific preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, among others. Normalization and scaling are used to bring the data into a common range, which can improve the model's performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features for the model.

While these preprocessing steps are crucial, the context does not provide specific information about them. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
