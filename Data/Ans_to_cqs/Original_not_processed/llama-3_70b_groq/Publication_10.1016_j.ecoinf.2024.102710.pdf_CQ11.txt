Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It provides links to GitHub repositories and TensorFlow Hub models, but it does not mention a data repository link like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and results of the study, rather than providing a link to a data repository.
