Answer: The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context appears to be object detection and species identification in camera trap images. Specifically, models like YOLOv4 and Scaled-YOLOv4 are used for object detection, while others like Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation are used for instance segmentation of animal species in video clips. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning models for species identification, with the goal of training bespoke neural networks for specific sets of species. Overall, the purpose of these deep learning models is to analyze and process camera trap data to identify and classify animals, reducing the amount of useless data being collected.
