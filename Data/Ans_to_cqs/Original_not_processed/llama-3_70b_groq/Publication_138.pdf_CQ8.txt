Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the ICSNet model and its performance compared to other deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
