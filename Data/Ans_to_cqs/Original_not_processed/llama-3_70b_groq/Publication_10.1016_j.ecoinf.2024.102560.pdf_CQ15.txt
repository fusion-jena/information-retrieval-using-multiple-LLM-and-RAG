Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, discussing topics like soil erosion, lake drying, drought, and soil salinity. It mentions machine-learning algorithms being used to map soil salinity, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
