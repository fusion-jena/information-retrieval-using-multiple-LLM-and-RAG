Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution, and statistical machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or its purpose. The text discusses issues with crowdsourcing data analysis, species distribution models, and statistical methods, but it does not mention deep learning or its applications. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
