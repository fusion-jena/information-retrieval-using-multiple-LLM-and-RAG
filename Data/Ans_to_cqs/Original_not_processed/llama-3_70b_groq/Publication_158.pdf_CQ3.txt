Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the challenges of object detection due to varying image object sizes and scales, and the use of an ensemble with varying input image sizes to address this issue. It also mentions that segmentation-based approaches were considered, but sufficient quality training data for segmentation was a limitation. However, it does not specify the annotation techniques used for the training data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
