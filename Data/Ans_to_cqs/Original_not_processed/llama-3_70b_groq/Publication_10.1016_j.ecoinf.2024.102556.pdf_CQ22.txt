Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the architecture and components of the model, such as the multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet), Res2Net, and YOLOv7, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
