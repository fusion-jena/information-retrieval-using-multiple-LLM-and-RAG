Answer::: 
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. This is stated in the context as "we performed a grid search over 216 different U-Net-like architectures and found several of the best ones which are suitable for forest damage segmentation." This indicates that the authors exhaustively searched through all possible combinations of the specified hyperparameters to find the optimal set.
