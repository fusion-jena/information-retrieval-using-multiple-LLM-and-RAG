Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different models and techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, including the use of multiple probabilistic classification models, tile models, and space-spectrum array models. It also discusses the issue of unbalanced training data and various sampling techniques to address it. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
