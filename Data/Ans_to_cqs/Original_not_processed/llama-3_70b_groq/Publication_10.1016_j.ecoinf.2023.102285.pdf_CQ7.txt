Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the methodology for developing and evaluating a model, including testing and evaluating the model using different datasets, but it does not provide specific details on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it can be inferred that the authors follow a general approach of splitting the data into multiple datasets for training, testing, and evaluation. The context mentions that the model is tested using another dataset completely different from the first dataset to observe if the test results are satisfactory without overfitting, and then evaluated by field experts using a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. This suggests that the data is split into at least three parts: a training dataset, a testing dataset, and a validation dataset. But the specific criteria used to split the data are not provided.

In general, common criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
