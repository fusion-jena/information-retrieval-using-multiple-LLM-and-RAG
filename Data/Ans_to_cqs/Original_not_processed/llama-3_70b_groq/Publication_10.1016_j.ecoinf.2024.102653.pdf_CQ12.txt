Answer::: 

The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. This is stated in section 2.3 of the text, which describes the deep neural network architecture used for predicting pesticide presence in bees. The model architecture is illustrated in Fig. 3 and consists of two BiLSTM layers that process three integrated features: the daily number of flights, the duration spent outside each day, and the bee's age.
