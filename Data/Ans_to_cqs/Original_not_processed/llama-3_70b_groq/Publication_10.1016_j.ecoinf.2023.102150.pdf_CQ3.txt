Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models for image classification and annotation.

The context mentions the use of AIDE (Annotation Interface for Data-driven Ecology), an open-source web framework for image annotation that also provides tools for training machine learning models. It also mentions the use of semi-automatic workflows that combine automatic classification and human labeling.

While it does not provide specific details on the annotation techniques used, it suggests that human labeling and annotation are involved in the pipeline. However, the exact techniques used for data annotation are not specified.
