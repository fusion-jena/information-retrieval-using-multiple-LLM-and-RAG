Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text only discusses the experimental design, model training, and hyper-parameter settings, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the authors "randomly extracted capture events" and "randomly selected events" to create the training sets. This implies that randomness is introduced in the data preparation step, but it is not clear how this randomness is controlled or handled in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of the results. But in this specific context, there is no mention of such a strategy being employed.
