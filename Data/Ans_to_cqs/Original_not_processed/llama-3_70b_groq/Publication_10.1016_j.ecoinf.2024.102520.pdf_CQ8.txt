Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper or study focused on ecological informatics, soil sampling, and land use analysis, with references to GIS, remote sensing, and satellite imagery. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository, making it impossible to determine where the code repository is available.
