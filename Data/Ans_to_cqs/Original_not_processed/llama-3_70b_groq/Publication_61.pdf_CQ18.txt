Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the training loss and accuracy plots (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) and validation accuracy plot (Fig. 10). These plots are commonly used to monitor the model's performance during training and validate its performance on a separate dataset.
