Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the proposed approach for plant identification using CNN-based methods, attention mechanisms, and data augmentation techniques. It discusses the importance of texture characteristics, the use of Bayesian optimizers, and the evaluation of optimal augment policies. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
