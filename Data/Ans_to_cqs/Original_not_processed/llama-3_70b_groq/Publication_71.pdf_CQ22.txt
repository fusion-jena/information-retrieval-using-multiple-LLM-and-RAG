Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions "performance metrics" and "average overall accuracy" without providing further details. 

It can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used, as it is mentioned that the average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298. However, other common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are not mentioned. 

Therefore, I don't know the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model beyond accuracy.
