Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various neural network architectures such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
