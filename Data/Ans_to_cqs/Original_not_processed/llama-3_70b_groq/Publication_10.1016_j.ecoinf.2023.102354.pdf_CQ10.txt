Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research article or paper discussing the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. It provides background information on the GAB, its characteristics, and the research objectives, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline implementation.
