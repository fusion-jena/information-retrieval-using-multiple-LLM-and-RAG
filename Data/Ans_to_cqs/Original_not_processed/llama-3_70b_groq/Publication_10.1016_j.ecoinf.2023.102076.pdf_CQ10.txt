Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the implementation and evaluation of a hierarchical text classification pipeline, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. The references cited are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository as it is not available in the provided context.
