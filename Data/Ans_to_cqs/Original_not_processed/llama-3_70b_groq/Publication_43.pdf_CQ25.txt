Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is trained to classify images into two classes: Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation. The model is designed to predict the class label of an input image, and the objective of the training is to minimize the prediction loss. The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the ground truth label. The model is trained on a dataset of 80x80-pixel image patches, with 80 images for training and 20 images for validation for each class. The goal is to develop a CNN classifier that can accurately classify images into these two classes.
