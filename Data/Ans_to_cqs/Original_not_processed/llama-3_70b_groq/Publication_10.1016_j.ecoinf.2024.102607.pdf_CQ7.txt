Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on addressing the problem of unbalanced training data in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping using various sampling techniques and models such as Random Forest and Spaceâ€“spectrum array. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
