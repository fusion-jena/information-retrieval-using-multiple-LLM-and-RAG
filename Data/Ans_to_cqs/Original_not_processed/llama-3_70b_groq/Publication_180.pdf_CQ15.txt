Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the adaptation and configuration of TensorFlow for the project, including adjusting two parameters: validation percentage and number of training steps. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
