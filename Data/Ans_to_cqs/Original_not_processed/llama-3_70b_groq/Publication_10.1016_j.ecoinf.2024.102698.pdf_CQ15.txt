Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the use of deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
