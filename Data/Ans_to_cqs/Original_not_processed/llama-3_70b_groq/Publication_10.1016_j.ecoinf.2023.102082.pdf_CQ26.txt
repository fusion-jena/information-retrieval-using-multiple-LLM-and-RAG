Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning approaches, convolutional neural networks, and machine learning algorithms for fusing GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images to produce high-resolution CHM maps. It also mentions various studies that utilize machine learning techniques for forest fuels classification, biomass density estimation, and surface elevation modeling. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
