Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide a link to it. The text only describes the methodology and approach used in the study, including the use of BERT and the hierarchical text classification pipeline, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
