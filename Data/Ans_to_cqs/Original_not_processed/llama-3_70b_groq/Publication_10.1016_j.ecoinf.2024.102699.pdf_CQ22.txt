Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects of machine learning and computer vision, including evaluation and performance metrics, but it does not provide a clear answer to this specific question.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the importance of evaluating and optimizing augmentation strategies for deep learning models, which suggests that metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall might be relevant in this context. Additionally, the context cites a paper on "Grad-CAM: Why Did You Say That?" which is a technique for visualizing and explaining the decisions made by deep learning models, which might be related to evaluating their performance.

In general, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and others, depending on the specific problem and task at hand. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which metrics are used in this particular context.
