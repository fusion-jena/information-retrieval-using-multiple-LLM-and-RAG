Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the models. The context discusses the architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures of PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
