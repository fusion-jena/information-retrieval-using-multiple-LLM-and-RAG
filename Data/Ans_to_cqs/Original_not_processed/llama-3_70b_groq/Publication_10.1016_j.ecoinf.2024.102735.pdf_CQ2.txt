Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is CSV (Comma Separated Values). This is inferred from the table provided in the context, which shows a dataset with various water quality parameters such as temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a, among others. The table is structured in a format that is typical of CSV files, with each row representing a single data point and each column representing a different parameter. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
