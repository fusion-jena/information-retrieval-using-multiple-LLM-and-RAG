Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the engines supported by ibis.iSDM for inferring or projecting relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features, which include regression and non-parametric machine learning approaches, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
