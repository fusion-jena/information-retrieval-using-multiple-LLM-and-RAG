Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context discusses the HRNet model, semantic segmentation, and formulas for deriving greenness, blueness, and sky openness index, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
