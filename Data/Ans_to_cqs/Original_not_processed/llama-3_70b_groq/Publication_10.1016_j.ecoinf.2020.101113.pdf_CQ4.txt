Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that "data augmentation (i.e. noise addition)" was used in previous studies to improve performance. This suggests that noise addition was used as a data augmentation technique, but it does not provide information on other techniques that may have been used.

It's worth noting that the context focuses on bioacoustic recognition and soundscapes, which may require different data augmentation techniques than those typically used in image classification tasks. Therefore, it's possible that the data augmentation techniques used in this study may be specific to the audio domain and not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, the only data augmentation technique mentioned is noise addition, but it's unclear if other techniques were used.
