Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of deep learning models for remote sensing data, provides some mathematical equations for an LSTM network, and references some papers on deep learning for remote sensing data. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search or random search.
