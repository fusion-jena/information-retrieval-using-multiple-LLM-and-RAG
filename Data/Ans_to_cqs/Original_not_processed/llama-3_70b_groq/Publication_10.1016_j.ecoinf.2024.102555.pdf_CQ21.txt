Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and ecological studies, with references to research papers on topics such as vegetation and land-cover change in Arctic tundra ecosystems and ecological restoration through vegetation patterns in the lower Tarim River, China. There is no information about machine learning models or postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
