Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in wildlife population estimation, aerial surveys, and biodiversity monitoring, rather than delving into the technical aspects of deep learning pipeline management.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the selection of the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, which might imply some form of regularization or early stopping to avoid overfitting. But this is not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and employing ensemble methods. However, these are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
