Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the use of GPUs in computation, particularly in machine learning applications, and cites various papers and software tools related to this topic. It does not delve into the specifics of data splitting for deep learning model training.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention machine learning applications involving recognition and classification of visual images and acoustic recordings, which often require data splitting into training, testing, and validation sets. But the criteria for splitting the data are not discussed.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question.

In summary, the provided context does not provide the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and a more specific context or information is needed to answer this question accurately.
