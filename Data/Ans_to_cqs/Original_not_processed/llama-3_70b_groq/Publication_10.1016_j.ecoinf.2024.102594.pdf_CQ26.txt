Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the following techniques are mentioned:

* Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis
* Exchanging between multiple image channels while the labels remain unchanged
* Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°
* Randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged

These techniques are used to enhance the training set and increase the sample size, which can help to mitigate data bias. However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.
