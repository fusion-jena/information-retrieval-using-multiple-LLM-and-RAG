Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that remotely sensed data is utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions the use of hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data, as well as NAIP imagery, for land use and land cover classification. Additionally, it mentions the use of Google Earth Engine Python API for data collection.

It does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or sensors for data collection. However, it does mention the potential of leveraging cloud computing and machine learning to analyze remotely sensed data, which suggests that the data collection method is focused on remote sensing technologies.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline, and it's possible that other methods such as surveys or sensors may be used in addition to remotely sensed data. However, based on the provided information, it appears that remotely sensed data is a primary method for collecting raw data.
