Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be discussing the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions and investigating climatic hotspots in the GAB region. It presents results of SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) analysis and discusses the relevance of the findings for policy and management. There is no mention of strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
