Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that more details about the architectures, training methods, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters can be found in the SI Appendix, Preprocessing and Training. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
