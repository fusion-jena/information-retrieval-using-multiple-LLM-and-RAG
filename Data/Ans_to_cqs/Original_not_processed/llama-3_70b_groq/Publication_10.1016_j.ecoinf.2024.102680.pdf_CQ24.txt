Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network and the proposed modifications to improve its performance on underwater optical images. It discusses the preprocessing operations, batch size, and feature extraction techniques, but does not address randomness or random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
