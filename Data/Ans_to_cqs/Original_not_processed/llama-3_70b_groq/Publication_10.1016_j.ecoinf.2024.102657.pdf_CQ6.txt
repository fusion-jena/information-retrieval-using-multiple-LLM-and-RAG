Answer:::

According to the provided context, no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms before training the CNN model. The goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. This suggests that the model was trained on raw data without any normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is not explicitly stated what preprocessing steps were involved before generating the spectrograms from the bird song data.
