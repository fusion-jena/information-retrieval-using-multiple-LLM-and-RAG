Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models (LM, GLM, and ANN) was evaluated using the "training dataset" and further validated using the "testing dataset". This suggests that the models were trained on the "training dataset" and their performance was monitored by evaluating their accuracy on the "testing dataset". The metrics used to evaluate the model performance include R-squared, mean absolute difference, and mean deviance.
