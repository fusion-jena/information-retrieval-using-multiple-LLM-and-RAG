Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) method, for classifying Landsat images and detecting invasive species. It also mentions the comparison of SAE with traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the use of phenological knowledge to improve the performance of deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.
