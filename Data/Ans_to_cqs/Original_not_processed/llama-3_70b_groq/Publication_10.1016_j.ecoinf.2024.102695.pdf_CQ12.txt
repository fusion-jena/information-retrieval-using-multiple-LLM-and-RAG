Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer model. This is explicitly stated in Section 3.4.3, which describes the architecture of the Transformer model used in the study. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, with each encoder layer containing a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward neural network.
