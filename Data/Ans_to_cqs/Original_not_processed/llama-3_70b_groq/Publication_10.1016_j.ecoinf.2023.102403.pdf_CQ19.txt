Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to biodiversity and ecology, discussing online repositories and databases for species occurrence data, such as FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. It also mentions data curation and filtering processes, but does not mention deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model based on the provided context.
