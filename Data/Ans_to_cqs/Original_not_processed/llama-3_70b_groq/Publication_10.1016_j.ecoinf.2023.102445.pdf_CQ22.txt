Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. AP (Average Precision): It is calculated using the formula ∫P(r)dr, where P(r) is the precision at recall r.

2. mAP (mean Average Precision): It is the average of AP across all classes. The formula is mAP = ∑Nk=1APk/N.

3. P (Precision): It is calculated using the formula P = TP/(TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.

4. R (Recall): It is calculated using the formula R = TP/(TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives.

5. mAP@0.5: It is the average accuracy for all classes at an IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5.

6. mAP50-95: It is the average accuracy across all classes at different IoU thresholds, spanning from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.

7. Time metric: It is calculated by summing the runtimes for the preprocessing, network inference, and post-processing stages.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO_MRC) in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size.
