Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that data augmentation is used to estimate ÏƒARU by adding a number of known 'non-detections' with distance of NA to the dataset of detected or simulated calls. It does not provide details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
