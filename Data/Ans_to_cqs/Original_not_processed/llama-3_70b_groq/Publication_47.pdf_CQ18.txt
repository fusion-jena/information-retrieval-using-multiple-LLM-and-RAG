Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Specifically, 20% of the training set was used for validation, and this validation set was shifted 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.
