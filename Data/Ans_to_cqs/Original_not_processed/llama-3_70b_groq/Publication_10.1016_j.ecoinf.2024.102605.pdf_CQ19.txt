Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the implementation details of a deep learning model, including the framework used to build it. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used to build the deep learning model.
