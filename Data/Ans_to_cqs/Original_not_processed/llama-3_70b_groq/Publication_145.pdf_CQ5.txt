Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text only mentions that the model was trained on 24 images per batch for 300 epochs, but it does not specify the name of the dataset used. It is also mentioned that the model was validated on a dataset and segmented 1195 objects, but again, the name of the dataset is not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the datasets used are MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, or something else.
