Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It discusses a mobile app used for marine species monitoring, data collection, and citizen science. The app is used to collect data on the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa, and it also collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers. The context mentions the use of machine learning in a single sentence, citing a study by Saoud et al. (2020), but it does not provide any information about the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
