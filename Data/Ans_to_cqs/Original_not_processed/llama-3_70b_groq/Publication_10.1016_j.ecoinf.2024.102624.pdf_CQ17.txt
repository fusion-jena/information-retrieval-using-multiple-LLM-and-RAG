Answer: 

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to classification and regression training using random forests, support vector machines, and multivariate adaptive regression splines, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
