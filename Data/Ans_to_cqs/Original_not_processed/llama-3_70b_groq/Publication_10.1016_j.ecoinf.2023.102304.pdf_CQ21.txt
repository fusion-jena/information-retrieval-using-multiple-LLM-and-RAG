Answer:::

Based on the provided context, I don't see any information related to postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing model optimization, parameter settings, and accuracy evaluation, but it does not mention specific postprocessing steps.

The context mentions "Accuracy evaluation" as a separate section, but it does not provide details on what specific steps are involved in this evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.

If more context or information is provided, I may be able to assist further.
