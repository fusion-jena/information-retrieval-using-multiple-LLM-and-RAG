Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it can be inferred that the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall are part of the postprocessing steps. Additionally, the creation of confusion matrices (as shown in Figs. 4 and 5) is also a postprocessing step.

There is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. It is possible that other postprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the given text.
