Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10âˆ’4). This suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during the training process, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used (e.g., SGD, Adam). Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
