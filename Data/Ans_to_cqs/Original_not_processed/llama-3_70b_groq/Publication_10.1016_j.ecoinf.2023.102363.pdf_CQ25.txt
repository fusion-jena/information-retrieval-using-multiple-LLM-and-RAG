Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is fine-tuned to classify the PAM (Passive Acoustic Monitoring) data frames into specified sound source classes. The model uses a novel spectrogram representation of the audio data as input and is trained to classify the spectrograms into different classes. The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify the audio data into the specified sound source classes.
