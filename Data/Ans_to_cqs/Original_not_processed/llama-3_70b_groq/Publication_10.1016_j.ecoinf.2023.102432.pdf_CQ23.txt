Answer:::

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of MTMI-SMF, a machine learning approach that can handle imperfect data. To ensure the generalizability of the MTMI-SMF model, the data was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations. This means that the model was trained and tested on different subsets of the data five times, which helps to reduce overfitting and increase the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. 

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of 5 K-fold cross-validation is a measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
