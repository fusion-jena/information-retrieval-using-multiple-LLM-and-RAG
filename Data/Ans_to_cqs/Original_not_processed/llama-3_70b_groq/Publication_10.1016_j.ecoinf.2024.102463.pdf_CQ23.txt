Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model will be trained on one of the three datasets, and the standardization parameters will be calculated and applied to the other two datasets considered as test bases. This suggests that the model will be evaluated on multiple datasets, which can help to some extent in ensuring generalizability. 

Additionally, the context describes the HyperBand algorithm, which is used for hyperparameter optimization. This algorithm explores several configurations in parallel and allocates more training resources to promising configurations, which can help to identify the best hyperparameters for the model. However, it does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
