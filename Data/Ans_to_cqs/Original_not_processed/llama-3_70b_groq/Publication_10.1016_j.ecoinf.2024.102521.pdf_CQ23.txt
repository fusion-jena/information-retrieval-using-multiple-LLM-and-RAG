Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context discusses the importance of data sharing, regulation, and funding agencies' roles in promoting data-intensive research. It also mentions several research papers on using deep learning for computer vision in ecological research on arthropods, but it does not provide details on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in those studies.

Additionally, the context discusses the development of STARdbi, a platform for training and storing models, and its modular classification scheme, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
