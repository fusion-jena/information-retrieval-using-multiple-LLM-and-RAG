Answer: 

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it mentions the use of four different models, including one regression-based model (Generalized Linear Model (GLM)) and three machine-learning models (Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)). 

To ensure the generalizability of these models, the authors employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. This approach helps to evaluate the models' performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure generalizability.
