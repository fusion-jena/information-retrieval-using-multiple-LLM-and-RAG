Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models and their performance on seagrass coverage estimation tasks, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
