Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, results, and analysis of different embedding models and active learning strategies. It does not provide information about the training process or hyperparameters of the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
