Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the analysis of the case study on aphid data, the performance of the PBP method, and its comparison with other machine learning methods. It discusses the accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate of the models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
