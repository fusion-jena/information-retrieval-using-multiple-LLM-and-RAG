Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9. This is mentioned in section 2.2.6 of the context, which describes the model training and hyper-parameters. There is no mention of Adam or any other optimization techniques being used.
