Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental science, discussing topics such as the Trophic State Index, fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), and the effects of nutrient and environmental factors on FDOM. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
