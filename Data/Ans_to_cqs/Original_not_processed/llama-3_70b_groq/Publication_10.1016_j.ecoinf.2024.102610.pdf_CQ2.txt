Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on predicting infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases using machine learning and deep learning approaches. The context mentions the use of remote sensing techniques, which suggests that the data formats used might include image data. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention the use of R packages such as caret, VSURF, and pdp, which are commonly used for data preprocessing, feature selection, and visualization. These packages typically work with CSV or tabular data formats. However, it is unclear whether these packages are used specifically for the deep learning pipeline or for other purposes.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the pipeline uses other data formats such as CSV, JSON, or GeoTIFF, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, while it is likely that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline, the specific data formats used are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
