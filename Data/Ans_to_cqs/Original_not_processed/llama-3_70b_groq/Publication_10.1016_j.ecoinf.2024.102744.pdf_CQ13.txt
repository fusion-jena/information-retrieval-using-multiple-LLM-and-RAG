Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the models, the evaluation metrics, and the results of the experiments. It discusses the different models used, such as YOLOv5, Faster RCNN, and DETR, and their performance on the task of pollen-bearing bee detection. It also explains the focal loss function and its benefits, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
