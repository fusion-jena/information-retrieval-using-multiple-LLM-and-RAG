Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather as a MaxEnt-based ecological niche model. The model is used to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in a specific basin under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The model takes species occurrence and prevalence data as input and produces spatial species distributions over the years for 180 species. The output is then binarised through thresholding and used to obtain species richness through model overlapping and summing. Therefore, the purpose of the model can be interpreted as a form of species distribution prediction or habitat suitability modeling, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
