Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be related to a study on mangrove species and their conservation, using remote sensing and machine learning approaches. It discusses the limitations of the study, the methods used for image classification, and the calculation of spatial variance. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
