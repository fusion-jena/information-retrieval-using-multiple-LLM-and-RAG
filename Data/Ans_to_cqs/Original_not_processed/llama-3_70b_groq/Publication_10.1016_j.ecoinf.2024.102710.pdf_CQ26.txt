Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on active learning strategies, such as uncertainty and diversity-based sampling, and their combinations, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.
