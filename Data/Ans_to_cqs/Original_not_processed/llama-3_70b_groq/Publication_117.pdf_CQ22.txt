Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that the results of both approaches (citizen science and deep learning) were compared, and that both methods provided highly accurate total estimates. However, it does not provide details on the specific metrics used to measure the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
