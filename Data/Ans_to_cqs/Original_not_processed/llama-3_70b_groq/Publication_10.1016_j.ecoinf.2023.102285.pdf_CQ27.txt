Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is outlined in the provided context. According to the text, the model deployment involves three phases: 

i) preventing overfitting, 
ii) letting field experts evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets, 
iii) and finally, letting field experts evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. 

If the model passes these three phases successfully, it can be deployed. The experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM's database. The viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases.

However, the context does not provide specific details on model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
