Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and coral reef classification tasks. It discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs, fine-tuning, and spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, but it does not mention regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
