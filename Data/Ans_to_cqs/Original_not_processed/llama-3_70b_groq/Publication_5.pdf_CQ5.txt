Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and species richness mapping, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
