Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) models and the preprocessing steps involved in preparing the training samples for RF models.

However, it can be inferred that the study utilized the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to eliminate cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels and to remove outliers from the training samples. This suggests that some form of data cleaning or filtering was performed, but the specific steps involved are not detailed.

Additionally, the context does not mention normalization, scaling, or other preprocessing steps commonly used in deep learning models. It is possible that these steps were performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and further information would be required to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model in this study.
