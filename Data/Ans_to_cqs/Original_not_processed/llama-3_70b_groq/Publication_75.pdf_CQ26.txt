Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the experimental setup, network architecture, and results of the classification and retrieval tasks, but it does not provide information on how data bias was handled. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
