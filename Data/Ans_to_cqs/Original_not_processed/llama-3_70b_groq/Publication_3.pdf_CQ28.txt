Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that TensorFlow's flexible architecture allows easy adaptation and deployment on different platforms including desktops, clusters of servers, edge devices, and mobile phones. However, it does not specify which platform was used in this particular research. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
