Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network, the process of analyzing landscape and land surface changes, and the importance of addressing the challenge of limited data availability for training deep neural networks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
