Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is target detection, specifically for fish biomass estimation. The model is designed to automatically detect fish in underwater images, which is a crucial step in estimating their biomass. The authors mention that the use of a deep learning network for high-quality target detection proved crucial in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment. This suggests that the model is trained to detect fish in images, which is then used to estimate their biomass. Additionally, the authors reference other studies that have used deep learning techniques for automatic detection and identification of fish body parts, such as the head and mouth, which further supports the idea that the purpose of the model is detection.
