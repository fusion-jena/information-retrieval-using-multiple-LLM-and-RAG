Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. It discusses active learning, deep learning, and dimensionality reduction, but it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model. It talks about training a model, selecting samples, and using different query selection strategies, but it does not cover the deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
