Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of various machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the study employed k-fold cross-validation, a widely used evaluation method in machine learning. Specifically, a 10-fold cross-validation design was used, where the dataset was split into 10 subsets. The model was trained on 70% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 30%. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for evaluation.

Additionally, the study used Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GSCV) to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters for each algorithm. GSCV generates a series of models, each with a different set of hyperparameters, and evaluates their performance through cross-validation. This process helps select the model with the optimal hyperparameter combination, which enhances the model's performance and generalizability.

While the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the employment of k-fold cross-validation and GSCV helps ensure the generalizability of the models.
