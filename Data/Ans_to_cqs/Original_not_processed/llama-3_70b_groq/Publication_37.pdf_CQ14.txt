Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the values of certain hyperparameters, such as the learning rate (0.01), dropout probability (0.5), and penalty factor for L2-regularization (0.001). However, it does not specify how these values were chosen or if a hyperparameter optimization method such as grid search or random search was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
