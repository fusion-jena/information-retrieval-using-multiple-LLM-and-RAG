Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, the dataset used, and the improvement in prediction accuracy, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
