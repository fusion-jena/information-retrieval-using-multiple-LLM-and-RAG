Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the effectiveness of single-algorithm ensemble methods and heterogeneous ensemble techniques in improving the predictability of Machine Learning-based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM). It discusses various algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine, as well as Artificial Neural Network configurations. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.
