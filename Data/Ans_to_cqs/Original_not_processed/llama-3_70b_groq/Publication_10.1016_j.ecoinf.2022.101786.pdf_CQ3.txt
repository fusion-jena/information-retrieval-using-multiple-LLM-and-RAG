Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is inferred from the text, which mentions that the predictions come as a .JSON file containing the coordinates of the bounding box of each tentative annotation, along with a confidence score. Additionally, the evaluation of the model involves spatially matching CNN predictions and manual annotations to count the number of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) in each image in the testing set. A true positive is defined as an automatic annotation that falls within a 30-pixel distance from a manual one, which further supports the use of bounding box annotation. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques in the provided context.
