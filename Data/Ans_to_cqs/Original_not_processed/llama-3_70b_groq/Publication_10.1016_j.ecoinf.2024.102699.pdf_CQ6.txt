Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data augmentation techniques used in the context of birdsong classification. These techniques include adding Gaussian noise, pink noise, and other types of background noise, as well as applying horizontal roll, vertical roll, pitch shift, time mask, frequency mask, gain, loudness normalization, horizontal flip, vertical flip, and time stretch to the audio data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of ImageNet-based weights for pretraining the ViT models, which suggests that the input data may have undergone some form of normalization or scaling as part of the pretraining process. However, the specific preprocessing steps used are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query, as the necessary information is not available in the provided context.
