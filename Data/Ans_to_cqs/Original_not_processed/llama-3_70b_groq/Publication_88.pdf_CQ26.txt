Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is balancing the samples per class. This is evident from Tables 1, 2, 6, and 7, where the number of available deforestation and no-deforestation samples are presented, and the balanced samples per class are calculated.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific technique is used to achieve this balance. It could be oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or other methods. Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the exact technique used.

Therefore, I cannot confirm whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
