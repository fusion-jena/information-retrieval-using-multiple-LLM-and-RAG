Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It appears to discuss machine learning models, specifically random forest, and their evaluation using cross-validation techniques. 

To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, the following measures were taken:

1. Repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach: An outer 10 k-fold cross-validation was used to divide the data into holdout data and data for model development. An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation was then used to minimize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results.

2. Hyperparameter optimization: Bayesian Optimization was used to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development.

3. Repeated training: The training process was repeated 15 times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance related to random sampling.

These measures were taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results, but it is not clear if they were specifically used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
