Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The context mentions resizing images to specific resolutions (e.g., 300 × 300, 512 × 512) and applying data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustments, which are typical operations performed on image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data.
