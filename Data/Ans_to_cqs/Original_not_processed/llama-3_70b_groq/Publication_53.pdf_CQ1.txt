Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that high-definition satellite images were used as the input data for training the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect farm dams. This is mentioned in Section 3.2, "Data Verification", where it is stated that "we used artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address this critical global information gap." 

It can be assumed that the satellite images were obtained from public datasets or remote sensing platforms, but the exact source is not specified. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for collecting raw data.
