Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on text classification using transformer-based models, specifically BERT, and discusses techniques for preparing text data for model training and evaluation.

However, it does mention that researchers can annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data according to their own relevancy criteria. This suggests that manual annotation is used to label the text data, but the specific annotation techniques are not detailed.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
