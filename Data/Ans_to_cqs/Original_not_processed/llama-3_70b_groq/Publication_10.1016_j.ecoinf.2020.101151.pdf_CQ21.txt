Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to vegetation and human impact, with some numerical ranges and references to a study by Beck et al. (2002). There is no information about machine learning or model training, which makes it impossible to answer the query.
