Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the limitations of deep learning approaches, the assembly of a training database, and the use of transfer learning, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
