Answer::: 

To ensure the generalizability of the model, k-fold cross-validation was employed as the preferred approach for hyperparameter tuning. This technique involves dividing the development dataset into k groups, where one group is used as the tuning dataset and the remaining groups are used as the training dataset. The model is developed using the training dataset and its performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters. In this study, a value of 5 is assumed for k. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.
