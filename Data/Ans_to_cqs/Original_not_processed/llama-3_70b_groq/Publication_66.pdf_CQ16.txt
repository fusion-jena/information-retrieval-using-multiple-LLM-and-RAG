Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the use of 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for the training process.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include convergence of the model's performance metrics (e.g., validation loss plateau), reaching a maximum number of training epochs, or achieving a desired level of accuracy. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study.
