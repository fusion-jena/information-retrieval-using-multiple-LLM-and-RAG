Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only describes the overall study process, including data processing, model building, compilation, training, and testing, but does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository as it is not mentioned in the context.
