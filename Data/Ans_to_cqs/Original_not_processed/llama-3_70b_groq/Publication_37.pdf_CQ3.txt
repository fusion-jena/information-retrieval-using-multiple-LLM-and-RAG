Answer:::

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the classification of migrating birds' flight calls using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and unsupervised dictionary learning. It discusses the performance of these models on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species, but it does not provide information on the annotation techniques used to prepare the dataset.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
