Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the authors applied random variations and manipulations to the data, including flip, crop, contrast shift, translation, and rotation, to increase the size of the training dataset. This approach is mentioned in the section 2.3. Validation and training datasets, where it is stated that "Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training dataset, through random variations and manipulations to the data."

It does not appear that stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are explicitly mentioned as techniques used to address data bias in this context. Additionally, there is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data preprocessing pipeline, so it's possible that other techniques may have been used to address data bias that are not mentioned in the provided text.
