Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions that the data for this work are published on Kaggle and provides two links: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/urbansound8k and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/birdsdata. These links are for the datasets used in the study, not for the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
