Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of deep learning in the context of Salaken et al. (2019) and Sousa et al. (2020), but it does not specify the type of model used. Additionally, it mentions the use of CNN in the context of acoustic data analysis for identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows, but it is not clear if this is the only deep learning model used in the pipeline or if other models are also used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
