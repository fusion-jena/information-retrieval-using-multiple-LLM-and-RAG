Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a specific model and its properties, particularly in relation to the Von Neumann model. It discusses the probability of obtaining the Von Neumann dynamics under certain conditions and provides examples to illustrate this.

However, it does mention the concept of a random seed value, which is a common source of randomness in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. In general, random seed values are used to ensure reproducibility of results, as they allow for the same sequence of random numbers to be generated every time the model is run.

To handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, strategies such as fixing the random seed, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and employing ensemble methods can be employed. However, these strategies are not discussed in the provided context.

In summary, while the context touches on the concept of random seed values, it does not provide strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
