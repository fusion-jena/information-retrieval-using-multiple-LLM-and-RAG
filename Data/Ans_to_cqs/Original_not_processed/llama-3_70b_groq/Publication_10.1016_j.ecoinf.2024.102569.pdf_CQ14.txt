Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the RTMSPE is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, but it does not specify the optimization method used to find these values. It is possible that cross-validation could be used to obtain the RTMSPE, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
