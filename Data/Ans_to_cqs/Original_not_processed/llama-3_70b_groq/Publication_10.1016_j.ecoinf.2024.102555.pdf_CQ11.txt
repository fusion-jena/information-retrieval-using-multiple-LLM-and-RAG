Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of NDVI data and other climatic factors to study vegetation changes in China. The paper cites several references, but none of them seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
