Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the model, including the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and other hyperparameters, but does not specify the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
