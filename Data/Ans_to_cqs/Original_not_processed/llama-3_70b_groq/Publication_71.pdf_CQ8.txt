Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only provides information about the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and discusses the challenges of using DeepLabV3+ with four-channel input images. There is no mention of a specific code repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
