Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model's training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, encompassing 264 data points, and subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, comprising 72 data points, were reserved for testing and validation purposes. This data partitioning resulted in a distribution of 60% for training and 40% for validation and testing.

While this suggests that some form of data splitting was employed, it does not provide explicit information on whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods were used to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
