Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated based on their accuracy on the testing subsets. The context mentions that the training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, and the results are provided in Supplementary Tables S1-S6. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated based on their accuracy on the testing subsets, but the specific strategy or metric used to monitor the performance during training is not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer for training the AN algorithm, with an initial learning rate of 0.001 and a maximum number of epochs set to 15. This suggests that the model performance was monitored during training based on the optimization of the loss function using stochastic gradient descent. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training remains unclear.
