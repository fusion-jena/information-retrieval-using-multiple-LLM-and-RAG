Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing a Land Trends (LTR) model, which is a type of time series analysis model used to detect land cover changes, specifically wildfires. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are MS (maximum number of segments used for fitting) and RT (threshold of the fast recovery event), which are specific to the LTR model. There is no mention of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
