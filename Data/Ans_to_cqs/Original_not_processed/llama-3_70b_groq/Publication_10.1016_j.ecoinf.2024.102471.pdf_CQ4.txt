Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the Wav2vec model, including the feature encoder, transformer encoder, and context network. It also discusses the concept of vision transformers and their application in image processing. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
