Answer: None.

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The machine learning models mentioned are MaxEnt, RF (Random Forest), and SVM (Support Vector Machines), which are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. Additionally, there is no mention of any neural network architecture or deep learning-specific techniques. Therefore, it can be concluded that no deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
