Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters, model training, and remote sensing applications. It discusses the use of optimization algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model architectures, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
