Answer: 

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to clustering analysis, discussing methods such as the Elbow method and Distortion method, and distance metrics like Euclidean distance. There is no mention of deep learning, dropout, or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
