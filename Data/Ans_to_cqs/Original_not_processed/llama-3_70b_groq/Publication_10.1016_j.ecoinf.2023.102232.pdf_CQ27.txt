Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its deployment. The text discusses a physiologically based model for Drosophila suzukii and a hybrid algorithm that combines least squares methods with genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches to estimate model parameters. There is no mention of deep learning or model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
