Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of deep learning in bioacoustics, particularly in handling long audio files and scarce annotated data. It also discusses transductive few-shot learning and meta-learning methods, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
