Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation dataset. The authors applied an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets, respectively. This means that 80% of the labelled data was used for training the model, and 20% was used for validation. The model's performance was evaluated on the validation dataset during training, and the error rate, validation loss, and training loss were monitored. Specifically, at epoch 5, the error rate was 0.1538 (15.38%), the validation loss was 0.4211, and the training loss was not specified. This approach allows the authors to track the model's performance and adjust the hyperparameters or training process as needed to avoid overfitting or underfitting.
