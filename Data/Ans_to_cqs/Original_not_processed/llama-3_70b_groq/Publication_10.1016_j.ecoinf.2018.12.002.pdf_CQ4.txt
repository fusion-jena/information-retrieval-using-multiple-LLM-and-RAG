Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to animal movement ecology, machine learning, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision and image processing tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
