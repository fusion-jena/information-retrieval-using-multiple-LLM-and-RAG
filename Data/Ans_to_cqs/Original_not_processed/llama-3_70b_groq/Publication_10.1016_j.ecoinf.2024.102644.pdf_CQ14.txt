Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of MaxEnt for species richness estimation and the application of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric to select the optimal hinge features and check the model quality. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
