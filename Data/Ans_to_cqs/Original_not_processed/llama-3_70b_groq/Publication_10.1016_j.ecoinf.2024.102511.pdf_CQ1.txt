Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various methods are used, including surveys and sensors. 

For instance, the context mentions a "Passive Acoustic Survey of Deep-Diving Odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem 2018: Final Report" (Simonis, 2020), which suggests that surveys are used to collect data. Additionally, the context mentions echolocation clicks and acoustic signals, implying that sensors or acoustic monitoring devices are used to collect data.

Furthermore, the context mentions ERDDAP (Simons & John, 2022), which is a data server that provides access to various datasets, including those related to oceanography and marine life. This suggests that public datasets may also be used as a source of raw data.

However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer without additional information.
