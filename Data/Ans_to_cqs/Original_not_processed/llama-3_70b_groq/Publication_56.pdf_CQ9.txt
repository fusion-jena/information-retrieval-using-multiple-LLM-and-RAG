Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning approaches for remote sensing data analysis, but it does not provide information about the availability of the data or the pipeline used in the research. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
