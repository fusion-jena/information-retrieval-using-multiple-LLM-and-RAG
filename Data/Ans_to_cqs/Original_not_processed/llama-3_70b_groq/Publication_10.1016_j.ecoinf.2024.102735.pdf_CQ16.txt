Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the methodology adopted for developing machine-learning models to estimate the effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions. It discusses data acquisition, model development, and uncertainty estimation, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
