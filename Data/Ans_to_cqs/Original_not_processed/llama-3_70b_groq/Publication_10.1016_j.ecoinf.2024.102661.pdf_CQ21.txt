Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using the TPEBO algorithm and the architecture of the LSTM neural network. It discusses the definition of hyperparameter search ranges, the optimization objective function, and the training process. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
