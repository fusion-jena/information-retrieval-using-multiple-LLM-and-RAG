Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various machine learning models, such as Random Forests and XGBoost, and their applications in estimating aboveground biomass in forests, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, were used for training the deep learning model.
