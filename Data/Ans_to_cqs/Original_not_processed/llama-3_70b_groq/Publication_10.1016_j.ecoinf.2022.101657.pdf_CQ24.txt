Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning techniques for species identification in camera trap images, including the training of bespoke neural networks for specific species sets and the use of transfer learning. It also mentions the evaluation of neural networks using metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and the importance of reducing the amount of useless data collected by camera traps. However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
