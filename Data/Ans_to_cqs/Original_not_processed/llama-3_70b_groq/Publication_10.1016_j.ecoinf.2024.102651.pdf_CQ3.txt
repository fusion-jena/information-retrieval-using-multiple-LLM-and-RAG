Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the comparison and integration of different neural network architectures, including CNN, ViT, and hybrid networks, for image classification tasks. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures and their applications in various domains, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
