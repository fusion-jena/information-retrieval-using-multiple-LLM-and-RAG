Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the performance of different models (Cascade RCNN, Sparse RCNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, RepPoints, ATSS, and Deformable-DETR) on a bird detection task, comparing their AP scores and mAP scores at different training stages. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
