Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model architecture, dataset, and results, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used to optimize the hyperparameters.
