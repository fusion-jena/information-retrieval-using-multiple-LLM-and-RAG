Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used to handle imbalanced data and overfitting issues.

In the context, it is mentioned that "aggressive data augmentation" was applied to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. This suggests that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the impact of class imbalance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) cross-validation approach, which ensures that the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets. This approach can help reduce bias by preventing the model from memorizing specific subjects rather than learning generalizable features.

However, the context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It also does not provide information on diverse data collection methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that data augmentation and subject-exclusive cross-validation were used to address data bias and imbalance issues, but other techniques are not mentioned.
