Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the feature extraction process, the architecture of the custom D-CNN model (CoralNet), and the use of AlexNet for feature extraction. It also discusses the classification process using SVM, kNN, and decision tree classifiers. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
