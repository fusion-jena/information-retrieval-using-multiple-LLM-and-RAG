Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the application of deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam. In fact, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, the context does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
