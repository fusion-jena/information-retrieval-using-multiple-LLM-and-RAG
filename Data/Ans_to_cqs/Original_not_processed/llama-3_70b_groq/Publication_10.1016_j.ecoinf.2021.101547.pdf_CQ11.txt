Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the ImageNet database (http://www.image-net.org) as the source of the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, but it does not provide a link to a repository containing the deep learning pipeline or its associated data.
