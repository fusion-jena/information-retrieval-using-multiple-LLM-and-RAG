Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters, and it provides information about the models used (FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m) and their performance, but it does not mention the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
