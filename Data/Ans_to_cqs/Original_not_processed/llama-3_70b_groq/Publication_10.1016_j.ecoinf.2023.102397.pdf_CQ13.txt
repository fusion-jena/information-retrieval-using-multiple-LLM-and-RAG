Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context discusses various topics, including species distribution modeling, acoustic indices, bird diversity, and random forests, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The only mention of a deep learning model is in the context of Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), which discusses the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
