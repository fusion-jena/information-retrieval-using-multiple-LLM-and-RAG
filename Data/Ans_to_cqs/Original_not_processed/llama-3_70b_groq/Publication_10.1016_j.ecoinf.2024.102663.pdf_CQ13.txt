Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

1. Number of epochs: The model was trained with 10 and 50 epochs to compare the performance (Fig. 13).
2. Cosine learning rate scheduler (cos_lr): The model was trained with and without the cosine learning rate scheduler to compare the performance (Fig. 14).
3. Initial learning rate: The model was trained with initial learning rates of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 to compare the performance (Fig. 15).
4. Final learning rate: The model was trained with final learning rates of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 to compare the performance (Fig. 16).
5. Optimizer: The model was trained with RMSProp, SGD, and AdamW optimizers to compare the performance (Fig. 17).

These hyperparameters were varied to study their effect on the output metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95.
