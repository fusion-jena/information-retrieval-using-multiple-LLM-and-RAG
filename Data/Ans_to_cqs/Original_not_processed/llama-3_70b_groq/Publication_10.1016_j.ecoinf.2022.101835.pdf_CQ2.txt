Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and their optimization using Optuna. It discusses the hyperparameters and performance metrics of these models, but does not provide information about the data formats used. Therefore, I cannot determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
