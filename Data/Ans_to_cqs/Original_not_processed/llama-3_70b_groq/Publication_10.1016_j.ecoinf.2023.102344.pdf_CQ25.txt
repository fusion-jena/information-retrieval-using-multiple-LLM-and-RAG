Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN output, is to learn to map its high-dimensional input data to usually low-dimensional output that is suitable for the target output. This implies that the model is designed for classification tasks, where the input images are mapped to a lower-dimensional representation that corresponds to the desired class labels.
