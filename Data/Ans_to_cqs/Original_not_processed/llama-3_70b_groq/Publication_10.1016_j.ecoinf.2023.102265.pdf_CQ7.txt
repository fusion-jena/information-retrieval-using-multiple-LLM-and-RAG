Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of 5-fold cross-validation in training an SVM model. This implies that the data was split into folds, with 4 folds used for training and 1 fold used for validation in each iteration. 

Unfortunately, the context does not provide information on how the data was split into training, test, and validation sets. It only mentions the use of validation accuracy in evaluating the performance of the ResNet models. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
