Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the images on Flickr are "better annotated with tags, location, and description" which suggests that the annotations are in the form of metadata such as tags, location, and description. However, it does not provide information on whether bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
