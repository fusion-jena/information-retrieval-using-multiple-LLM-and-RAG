Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be discussing data management and citation practices in the context of the ESS-DIVE program, specifically focusing on issues related to data citation, authorship, and usage policies. There is no mention of deep learning or model training, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
