Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the architecture of the model, which is Inception v.3, and the optimization algorithm used, which is RMSProp. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
