Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of dropout and batch normalization layers in the DNN model, which can help reduce overfitting and increase generalization on testing data. Additionally, the hyperparameters of the model, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were tuned to optimize the testing accuracy and kappa. This suggests that the model was trained and evaluated on a separate testing dataset, which can help ensure generalizability to some extent. However, the context does not provide further details on the dataset used for training and testing, or any other measures taken to ensure generalizability.
