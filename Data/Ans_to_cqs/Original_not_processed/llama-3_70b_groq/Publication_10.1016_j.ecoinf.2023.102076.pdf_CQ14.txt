Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the preprocessing steps, such as tokenization, filtering, and deduplication, as well as the approach to handle long documents and the strategy to balance the dataset. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used.
