Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), Deep Extreme Learning (DELE), and other neural network architectures, but it does not discuss preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming features to have similar scales, often using techniques like standardization or min-max scaling
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data transformation: transforming data types, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables

These preprocessing steps can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model. However, the specific steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps, it is essential to perform these steps before training a deep learning model to ensure optimal performance.
