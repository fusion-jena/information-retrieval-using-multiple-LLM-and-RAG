Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the development of synthetic reef data pipeline models, their applications, and challenges. It discusses the importance of defining a narrow scope for the application of models, iterative improvement, and understanding complex relationships between datasets.

However, Table 1 provides a list of data utility metrics descriptions, including Ï‡2 test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Correlations scores, Mean data quality score, and Mean data diagnostics scores. These metrics might be used for evaluating the performance of the models, but the context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
