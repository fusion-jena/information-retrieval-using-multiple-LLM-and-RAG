Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

The overall accuracy is the number of images correctly classified out of the total number of images. 

The precision is the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the number of predicted images of that class. 

The recall is the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the number of annotated/observed images of that class. 

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
