Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of accuracy metrics on separate testing data, which is 25% of the samples, randomly split from the original data. This is a standard modeling practice, performed through the createDataPartition function in the caret package. The accuracy metrics used include the true positive rate or sensitivity, which measures the number of predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class, and the true negative rate or specificity, which measures the number of predicted observations where the response variable of interest did not occur.
