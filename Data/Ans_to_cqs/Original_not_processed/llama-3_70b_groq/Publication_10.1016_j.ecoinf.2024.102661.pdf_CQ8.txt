Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context appears to be a passage of text discussing the importance of hyperparameters in deep learning models, the TPEBO algorithm, and some specific hyperparameter settings, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
