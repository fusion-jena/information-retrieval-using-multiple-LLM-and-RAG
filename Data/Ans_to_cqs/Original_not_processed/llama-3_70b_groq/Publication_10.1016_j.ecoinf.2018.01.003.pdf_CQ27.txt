Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a deep learning model. It discusses the comparison of BPNN and SVM models for predicting Ecological Footprint (EF) and provides details on the experimental process, including the selection of parameters, iteration, and cross-validation. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
