Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics such as AUC (area under the receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic). These metrics are used to evaluate and compare the performance and accuracy of each model. 

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix. It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these steps were involved or not.

In summary, the only postprocessing steps that can be confirmed based on the provided context are the calculation of AUC and TSS metrics.
