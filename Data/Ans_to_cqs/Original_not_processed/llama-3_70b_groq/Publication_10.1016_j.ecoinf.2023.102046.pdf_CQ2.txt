Answer:::
Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions image encoders, image classification, and image resizing, indicating that images are a key data format used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions CLIP, which is trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions, further supporting the idea that images are a primary data format.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. However, it is possible that other data formats like CSV might be used in certain aspects of the pipeline, such as storing or processing metadata or captions associated with the images. But this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In summary, based on the provided context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
