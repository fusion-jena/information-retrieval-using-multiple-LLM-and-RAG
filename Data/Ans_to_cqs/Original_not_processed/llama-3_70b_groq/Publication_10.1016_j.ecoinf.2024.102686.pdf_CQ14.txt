Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for clustering and zoning, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. The context mentions the importance of optimizing the training algorithm for SVM, but it does not specify how this optimization is done. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
