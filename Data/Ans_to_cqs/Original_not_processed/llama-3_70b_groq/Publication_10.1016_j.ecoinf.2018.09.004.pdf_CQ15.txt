Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses feature selection, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and macro-averaging, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
