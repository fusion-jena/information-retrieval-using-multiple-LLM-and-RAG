Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning with the ResNet50 model, the architecture of the implemented CNN, and the evaluation of the predictive performance. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
