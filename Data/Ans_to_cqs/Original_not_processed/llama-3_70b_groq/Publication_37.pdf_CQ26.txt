Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as a technique used in combination with a deep convolutional neural network. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness to different scenarios. 

It does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
