Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors built their own dataset using 3 independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test their CNN model and post-processing method. These datasets were created by extracting fish images from 175 underwater high-definition videos.
