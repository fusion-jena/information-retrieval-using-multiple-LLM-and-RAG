Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the validation ENS (EarthNet Score) and stop the optimization when the validation ENS repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. This means that the model's performance on the validation set is evaluated at each epoch, and the training is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving. The model with the highest attained validation score is then selected as the final model.
