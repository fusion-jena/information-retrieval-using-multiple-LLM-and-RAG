Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their training. It discusses ensemble modeling frameworks, statistical models, and data splitting for model training, but not specifically for deep learning models. 

However, it does mention a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points, which is a common practice in machine learning model training. But it does not provide information on validation sets or deep learning model training specifically. 

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
