Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve remote sensing data from various sources. Specifically, the study uses GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. The GF-1 images are multispectral images captured with a wide-format WFV camera, with four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 m. The data is retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application.

Additionally, the study also involves field surveys, as mentioned in Table 2, which provides the number of validation samples from field surveys. However, the exact method of data collection through field surveys is not specified.

There is no mention of public datasets or sensors being used for raw data collection in the provided context. It is possible that other methods may be used, but based on the available information, remote sensing data and field surveys are the primary methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
