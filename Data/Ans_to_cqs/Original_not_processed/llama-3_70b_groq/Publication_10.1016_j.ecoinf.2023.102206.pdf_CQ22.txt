Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the models. Specifically, it mentions the percentage reduction in RMSE as a measure of the improvement in prediction accuracy. 

It does not mention other common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. that are typically used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only conclude that RMSE is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models, but we cannot determine what other metrics might be used.
