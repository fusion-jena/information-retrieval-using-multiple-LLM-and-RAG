Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various terms used to describe weakly supervised learning tasks, such as weak labels, partial labels, and distribution learning. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
