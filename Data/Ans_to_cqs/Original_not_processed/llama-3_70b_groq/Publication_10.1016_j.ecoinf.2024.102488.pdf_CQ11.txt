Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to this query. The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or data repository. The links mentioned in the context are related to accessing remote sensing data (https://data.cresda.cn) and do not seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline or data repository.
