Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and architecture of the pipeline, including the use of ResNet-50 and SVM classifier, but does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
