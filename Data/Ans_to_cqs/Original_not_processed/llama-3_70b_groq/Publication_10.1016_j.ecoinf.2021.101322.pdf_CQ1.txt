Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information about the datasets used in the research. 

The context mentions two datasets: the "Salmon scale 9056 image dataset" and an "Expert reading of extra 150 image dataset". The datasets are referenced with DOIs (digital object identifiers), which suggests that they are publicly available datasets. 

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. It is possible that the datasets were collected through other means, such as manual collection of salmon scales or images, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. 

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that public datasets were used to collect raw data, but the exact methods of data collection are not specified.
