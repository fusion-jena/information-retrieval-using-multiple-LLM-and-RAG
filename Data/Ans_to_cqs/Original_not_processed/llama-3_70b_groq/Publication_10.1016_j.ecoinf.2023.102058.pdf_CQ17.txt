Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "ML methods are prone to over-fitting and the curse of dimensionality" and suggests that "decreasing the feature space dimension using intelligent feature selection techniques can be another interesting topic of study." 

This implies that the authors are aware of the overfitting problem in machine learning, but they do not specify which regularization methods can be used to prevent it. Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
