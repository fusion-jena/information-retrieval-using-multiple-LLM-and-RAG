Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is random duplication of presence records and deletion of absence records to achieve a balance of ~50:50. This is mentioned in the text as "we balanced our data by randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records until a balance of ~50:50 is obtained, which was executed using the ROSE package (Lunardon et al., 2014) for R (R Core Team, 2020)". This technique is a form of resampling, specifically oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class, to address class imbalance. There is no mention of stratified splitting or diverse data collection in the provided context.
