Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the ELM model are optimized. It only mentions that OSELM, a variant of ELM, only requires the number of hidden nodes to be specified, implying that this hyperparameter is set manually or through some other means not described in the context. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized based on the provided context.
