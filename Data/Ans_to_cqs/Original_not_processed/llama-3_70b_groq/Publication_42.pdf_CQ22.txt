Answer:::
Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are F1-score, precision, and recall. This is indicated in the text as "average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, which indicated a suitable model classification." The F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy, and it is used to compare the performance of different models. The precision and recall are also used to evaluate the model's performance, but the exact formulas for these metrics are not provided in the context.
