Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models. Instead, it discusses the use of XGBoost and LightGBM, which are tree-based models, not deep learning models. 

However, the context does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these models. According to Table 4, the metrics used are RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting AGB (Above-Ground Biomass).
