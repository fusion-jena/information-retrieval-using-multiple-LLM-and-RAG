Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting disease incidence in cotton, and it does not provide detailed information about the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, and feature engineering. But, without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular study.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study, and further information would be required to provide a more accurate answer.
