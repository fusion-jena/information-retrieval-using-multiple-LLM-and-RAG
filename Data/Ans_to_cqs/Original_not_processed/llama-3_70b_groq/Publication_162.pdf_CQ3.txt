Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation. This is evident from the sentence "We then trained a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 [16] pre-trained on ImageNet [30]) on the cropped bounding box images of the detected moths..." which suggests that bounding box annotation was used to annotate the images of moths.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a Mask R-CNN architecture, which is typically used for instance segmentation tasks. The sentence "We also introduce a feature fusion module to combine the extracted features from both backbones using one 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduce the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This allows us to use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset [24] for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head." suggests that instance segmentation was also used in the pipeline.

However, it is not clear from the context if any other data annotation techniques were used in the pipeline.
