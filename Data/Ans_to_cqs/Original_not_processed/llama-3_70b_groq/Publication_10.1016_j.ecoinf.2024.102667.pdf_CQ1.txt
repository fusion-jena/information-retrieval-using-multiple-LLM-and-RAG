Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological research, discussing topics such as combating desertification, grassland gross primary production, and land use/cover datasets. 

However, it does mention that the land use/cover dataset for China was acquired from RESDC, and the boundary datasets for ecological engineering were sourced from the National Ecological Science Data Center. It also mentions that the land use/cover dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km Ã— 1 km and covers six major land use/cover categories and twenty-six subcategories.

It does not provide information on methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
