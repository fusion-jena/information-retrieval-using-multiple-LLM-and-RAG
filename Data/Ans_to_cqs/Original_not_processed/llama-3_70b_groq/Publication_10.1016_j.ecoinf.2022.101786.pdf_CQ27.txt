Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model selection, and performance evaluation. It discusses the training configuration, model parameters, and the time taken for training and prediction. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
