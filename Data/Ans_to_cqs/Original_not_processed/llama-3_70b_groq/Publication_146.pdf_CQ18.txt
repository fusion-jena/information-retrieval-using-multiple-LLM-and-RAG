Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the evaluation of various metrics at different iteration stages. Specifically, the model is evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP, as shown in Table 2. These metrics are calculated from model validation data, consisting of 321 image tiles.

The model's performance is monitored by tracking the changes in these metrics over the course of 350 epochs. The F1 score and mAP score are seen to follow each other closely, indicating the model's ability to detect objects accurately. The GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is becoming better at correctly locating targets.

By evaluating these metrics at different iteration stages (100, 200, 300, and 350 epochs), the model's performance can be monitored and adjustments can be made to the training process as needed. This strategy allows for a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses, enabling the identification of areas for improvement during training.
