Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any platform, nor does it mention any specific cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. In fact, the text states that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
