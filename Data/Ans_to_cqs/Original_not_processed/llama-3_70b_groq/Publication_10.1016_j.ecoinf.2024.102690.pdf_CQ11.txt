Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link associated with it. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, spatial analysis, and landscape ecology, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The links mentioned in the context are related to data sources such as the National Earth System Science Data Center, CRU dataset, and Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure, but they are not related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
