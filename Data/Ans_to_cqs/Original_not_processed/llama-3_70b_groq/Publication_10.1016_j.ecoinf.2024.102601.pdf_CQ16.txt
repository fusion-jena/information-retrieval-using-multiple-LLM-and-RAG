Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, including OA, Cohen's Kappa statistic, Mean Squared Error (MSE), confusion matrix, and Out-of-Bag (OOB) error rate. 

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated on both the training and validation datasets, and the hyperparameters are optimized to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and search precision. The model's performance is considered satisfactory with a flawless training accuracy of 1.0 and a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the validation dataset. 

Despite this, the context does not provide specific information on the stopping criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, it is unclear whether validation loss plateau or any other criteria are used to determine the completion of training.
