Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be discussing a geodatabase and an online tool for analyzing and visualizing environmental data, including pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics. It mentions that the entire geodatabase is available as a map package for download and use on personal computers, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository where it might be stored.
