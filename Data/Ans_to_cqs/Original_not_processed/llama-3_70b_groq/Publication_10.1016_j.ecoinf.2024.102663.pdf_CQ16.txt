Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the performance of various models, including their training times, prediction times, and evaluation metrics such as variance, R2 score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). It also presents several figures comparing different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, optimizers, and epochs. However, it does not specify the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, early stopping, or a specific number of iterations. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
