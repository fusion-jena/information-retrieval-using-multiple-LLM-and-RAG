Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques, such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it does not specify the framework used to implement these techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
