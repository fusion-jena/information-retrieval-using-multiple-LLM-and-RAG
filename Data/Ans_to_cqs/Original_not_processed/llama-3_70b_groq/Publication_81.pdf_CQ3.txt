Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the use of DNA barcode sequences for fish classification and the application of a novel deep learning method, ESK model, which combines Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). 

The context mentions that the DNA sequences are converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
