Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a section of a research paper discussing agroforestry, carbon sequestration, and machine learning models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). It includes figures and tables, but there is no mention of a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
