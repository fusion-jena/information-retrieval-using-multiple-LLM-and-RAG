Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the computing infrastructure, search strategy, and training duration for neural networks, as well as the hyperparameters used for training. It also mentions the use of electronic monitoring data and annotations from fishing sets, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
