Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing a model and its architecture, but it does not provide information about the code implementation or where it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
