Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a research article about forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models and Bayesian optimization. It discusses the structure of the LSTM model and the use of SHAP values to explain the contribution of features to the prediction. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
