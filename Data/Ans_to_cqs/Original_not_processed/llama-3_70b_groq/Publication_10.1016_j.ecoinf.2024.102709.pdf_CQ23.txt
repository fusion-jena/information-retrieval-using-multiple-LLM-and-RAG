Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors employed k-fold cross-validation with k = 5. This means that the data was split into 5 different training-test sets, and the model was trained on each training split separately. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a specific subset of the data. 

Additionally, the authors used the Python library scikit-learn to split the data and investigate the results of each trained model. They also investigated the YOLO training losses and mAP50 values of each model to determine the best data split. The split with the highest mAP50 value, which indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels, was chosen for the final prediction of the model.

It is worth noting that the authors used two different datasets for training the models: their own dataset (clusters of extracted numbers) and the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits. This diversity in datasets can also contribute to the generalizability of the model. However, there is no mention of stratified splitting or other measures to ensure diversity in the dataset.
