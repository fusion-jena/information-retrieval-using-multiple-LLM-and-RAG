Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forests, and the proposed PBP method. It discusses the implementation details of these methods, such as the architecture of DNN and the use of rectified linear unit (ReLU) and sigmoid activation functions. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
