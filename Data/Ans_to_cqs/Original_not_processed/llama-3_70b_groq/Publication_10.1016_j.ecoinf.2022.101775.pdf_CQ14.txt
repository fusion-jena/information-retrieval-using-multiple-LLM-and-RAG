Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the unknown parameters bs, bt, ps, qt can be estimated by optimizing the regularized cost function using stochastic gradient descent. 

Additionally, in the comparison with state-of-the-art models, it is mentioned that the MF model was tuned by employing a grid search. However, it does not specify how the hyperparameters of the DMF models were optimized. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the DMF models were optimized.
