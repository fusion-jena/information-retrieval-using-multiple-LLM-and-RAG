Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of accuracy metrics. Specifically, the true positive rate or sensitivity (a measure of the number of predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class) and the true negative rate or specificity (a measure of the number of predicted observations where the response variable of interest did not occur) are calculated. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps in the provided context. It is possible that these steps may be involved in the modeling process, but they are not explicitly mentioned. 

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration, as well as the application of multiple methods to detect overlapping outcomes. However, these steps appear to be part of the model training process rather than postprocessing steps.
