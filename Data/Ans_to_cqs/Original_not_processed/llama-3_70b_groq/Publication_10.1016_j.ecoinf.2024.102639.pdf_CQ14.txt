Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation. This is mentioned in the context under the section "2. For SVM" where it states that "The regularization parameter (‘C’) and the kernel type (linear) were calibrated through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation, aiming to mediate the balance between model complexity and its generalization prowess." Additionally, in instances involving non-linear SVMs, the kernel coefficient (‘gamma’) underwent optimization via grid search, ensuring the model’s attunement to the data distribution.
