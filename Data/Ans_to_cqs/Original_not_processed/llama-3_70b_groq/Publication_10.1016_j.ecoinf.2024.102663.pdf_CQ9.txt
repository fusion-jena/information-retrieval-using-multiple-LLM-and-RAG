Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of manual methods, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges. It also mentions specific deep learning models and architectures, such as Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and YOLO, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
