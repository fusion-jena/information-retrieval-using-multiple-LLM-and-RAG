Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is trained to classify audio segments into two categories: possum vocalisations and noise sources. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of 5-second audio segments, with 1130 possum vocalisations and 1870 noise sources. The model's performance is evaluated on a test set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The goal is to classify each segment as either a possum vocalisation or a noise source.
