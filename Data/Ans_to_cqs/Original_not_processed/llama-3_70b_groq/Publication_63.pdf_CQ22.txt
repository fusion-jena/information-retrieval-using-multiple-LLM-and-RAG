Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. Specifically, the MAE of the validation dataset is computed after each epoch, and the model training is stopped when the validation MAE does not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverges from the training MAE (i.e., 'overfit'). The MAE is also used to quantify the prediction accuracy of the model on the test dataset. There is no mention of other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to evaluate the model's performance.
