Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and urban planning, with references to academic papers on topics such as habitat suitability, urbanism, and optimization algorithms. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
