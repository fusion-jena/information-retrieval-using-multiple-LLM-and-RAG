Answer: The context does not mention deploying a deep learning model or using a specific cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. It only mentions the Google Earth Engine platform, which is a planetary-level cloud computing platform used for remote sensing data. It does not provide information about deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
