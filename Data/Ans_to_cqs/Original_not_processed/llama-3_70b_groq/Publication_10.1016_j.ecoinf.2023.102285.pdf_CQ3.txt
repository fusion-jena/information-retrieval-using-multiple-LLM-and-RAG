Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to detecting man-made underwater objects and surface marine objects using machine learning and deep learning approaches, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
