Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing a system for fire danger rating, including the development and validation of the system, and the use of indices such as the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) and the Fire Weather Index (FWI). There is no mention of training or criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
