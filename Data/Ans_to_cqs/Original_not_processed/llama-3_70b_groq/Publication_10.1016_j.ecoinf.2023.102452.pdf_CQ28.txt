Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to various topics such as forecasting, signal processing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
