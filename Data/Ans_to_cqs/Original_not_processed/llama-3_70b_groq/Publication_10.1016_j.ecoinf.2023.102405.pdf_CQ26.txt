Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on data pre-processing methods such as data cleansing, data imputation (using mean imputation), and capping to ensure the quality and completeness of the dataset. However, it does not discuss techniques specifically designed to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
