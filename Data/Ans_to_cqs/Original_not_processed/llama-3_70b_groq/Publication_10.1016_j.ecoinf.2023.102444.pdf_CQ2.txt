Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that remote sensing imagery is used in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the paper "species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery: how to capture fine-grained and large-scale vegetation ecology with convolutional neural networks?" This suggests that image data is used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the analysis of bird song features and vocalizations, which implies that audio data is also used in the pipeline.

There is no mention of video data or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store or process other types of data, such as bioclimatic variables or species distribution data, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to include image and audio data, but the use of video or CSV files is not explicitly mentioned.
