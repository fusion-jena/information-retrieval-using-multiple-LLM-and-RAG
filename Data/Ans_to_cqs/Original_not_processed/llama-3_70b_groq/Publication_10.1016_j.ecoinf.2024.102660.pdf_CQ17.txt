Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Reducing the number of convolutional kernels: The study reduces the number of 3 Ã— 3 convolutional kernels in the convolutional block from 64 to 32 to mitigate overfitting.
2. Residual structures: The incorporation of residual structures, inspired by the ResNet network, helps to mitigate overfitting issues in the network.

There is no mention of dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the provided context. However, the use of image augmentation operations, such as random rotations and flips, during the network training process can also be seen as a form of regularization to enhance the network's robustness.
