Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Archaeological survey data: The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) provides archaeological survey data for Land-Use/Land-Cover (LTA-LU) analysis.
2. Remotely sensed data: This includes data from spaceborne sensors such as Vegetation and Environment Monitoring on a New Micro Satellite (VENÎ¼S), airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for Land-Cover (LC) analysis.
3. Digital maps: The Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) provides digital maps for modern Land-Use/Land-Cover (LU/LC) analysis.
4. Georegistered orthophotos: The Survey of Israel (SOI) provides georegistered orthophotos with a 12.5 cm resolution for georeferencing and masking the study area.
5. Substrate data: The Israel Geological Survey (IGS) provides data on geology, and Ravikovitch (1969) provides soil data.
6. Climate-related data: The Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) provides climate-related data.

These data sources are used as input for the deep learning pipeline, which involves object retrieval with deep convolutional neural networks (Mohedano et al., 2017) and feature extraction in remote sensing using deep learning (Petrovska et al., 2020).
