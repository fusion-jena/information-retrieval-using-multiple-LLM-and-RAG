Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. This is evident from the reference to TensorFlow in the context, specifically in the citation "Abadi, Mart√≠n, Agarwal, Ashish, Barham, Paul, Brevdo, Eugene, Chen, Zhifeng, Citro, Craig, Corrado, Greg S., et al., 2015. TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems." Additionally, there is a mention of TensorFlow Hub, which is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.

There is no mention of PyTorch in the provided context, so it is unclear if PyTorch is used in the deep learning model. However, it is possible that other frameworks may be used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model, but it is unclear if PyTorch or other frameworks are also used.
