Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions various data sources, such as the National Earth System Science Data Center, CRU dataset, Guangzhou statistical yearbook, and others, but it does not provide information about where the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the pipeline is available.
