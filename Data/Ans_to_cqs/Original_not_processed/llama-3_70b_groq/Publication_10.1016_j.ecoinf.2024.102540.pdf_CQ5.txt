Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 80:10:10, and that the dataset consists of images of sorghum leaves with alates. The context also provides information about the image resolution and the number of images in each set, but it does not mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.
