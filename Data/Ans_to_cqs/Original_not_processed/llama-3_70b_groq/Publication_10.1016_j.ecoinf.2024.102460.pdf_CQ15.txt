Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the use of LSTM models, Markov chain models, and FMOP models, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
