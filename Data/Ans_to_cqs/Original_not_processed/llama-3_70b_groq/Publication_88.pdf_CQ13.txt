Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Batch size: 32
* Number of epochs: 100
* Early stopping: after 10 epochs with no improvement over the validation set
* Dropout rate: 0.2 in the final Fully Connected (FC) layer
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Weight decay: 0.9
* Learning rate: 10^(-3)
* Loss function: binary cross-entropy
