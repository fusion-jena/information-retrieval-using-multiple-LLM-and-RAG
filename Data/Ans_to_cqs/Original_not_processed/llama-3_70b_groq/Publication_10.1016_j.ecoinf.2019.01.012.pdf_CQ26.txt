Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

The context mentions that the model was trained from scratch using a large dataset with nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class, but it does not provide information on how the data was preprocessed or whether any techniques were used to address potential biases in the data.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query as the context does not provide the necessary information.
