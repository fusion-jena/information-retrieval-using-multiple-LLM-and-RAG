Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of SPOT6 satellite data, Deep Learning architectures, and XGBoost, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
