Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the training process of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, including the assignment of initial connection weights, forward-feeding of inputs, error computation, and back-propagation. It also mentions the optimization of hyperparameters such as learning rate, momentum, and training iterations. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
