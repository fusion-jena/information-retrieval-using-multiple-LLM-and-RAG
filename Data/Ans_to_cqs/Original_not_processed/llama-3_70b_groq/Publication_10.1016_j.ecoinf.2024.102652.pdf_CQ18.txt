Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of an early stopping function. According to the context, the training process involves 100 epochs, and the early stopping function is used to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This means that the model's performance is monitored during training, and if it stops improving after a certain number of epochs, the training process is stopped to prevent overfitting.
