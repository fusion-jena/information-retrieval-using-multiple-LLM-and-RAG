Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context discusses various machine learning models, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and their applications in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). However, it does not specify the purpose of the deep learning models, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.

Although the context mentions that the authors will investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), it does not provide information on the specific purpose of these deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific purpose of the deep learning model in this context.
