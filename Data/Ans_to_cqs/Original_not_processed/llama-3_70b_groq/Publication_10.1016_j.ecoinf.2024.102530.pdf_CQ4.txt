Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to land use/land cover classification, pollination models, and fuzzy inference systems, but it does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
