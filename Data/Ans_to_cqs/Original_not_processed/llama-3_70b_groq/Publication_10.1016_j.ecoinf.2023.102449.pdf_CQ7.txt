Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the encoder and decoder, as well as the pre-processing and post-processing blocks. It discusses the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and the reparameterization trick, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
