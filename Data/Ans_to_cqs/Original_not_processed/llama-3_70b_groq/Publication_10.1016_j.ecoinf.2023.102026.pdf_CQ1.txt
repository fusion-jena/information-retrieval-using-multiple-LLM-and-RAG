Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the use of camera trap datasets for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. It is possible that the camera traps were used to collect the data, but this is not explicitly stated.

The context focuses more on the analysis and modeling of the data using machine learning techniques such as random forests and bootstrapping, rather than the data collection process. Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular study.
