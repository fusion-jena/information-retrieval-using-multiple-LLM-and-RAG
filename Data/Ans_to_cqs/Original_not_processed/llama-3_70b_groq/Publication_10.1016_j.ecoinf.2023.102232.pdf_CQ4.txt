Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text appears to be discussing a hybrid algorithm that combines a least squares (LS) algorithm with a genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation, and it provides details about the computing tools and infrastructure used for the calculations. There is no mention of deep learning or image processing, which are the typical domains where data augmentation techniques are applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
