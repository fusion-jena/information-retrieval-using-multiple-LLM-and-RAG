Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using an average precision metric. Additionally, the predicted bounding boxes were compared with the annotated scans to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model.

It is mentioned that around 200 scans were annotated by hand, based on the predicted bounding boxes, which reduced the time to annotate these scans. This suggests that the model's output was used to facilitate the annotation process, but the exact postprocessing steps are not detailed.

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps were involved in the postprocessing of the model's output.
