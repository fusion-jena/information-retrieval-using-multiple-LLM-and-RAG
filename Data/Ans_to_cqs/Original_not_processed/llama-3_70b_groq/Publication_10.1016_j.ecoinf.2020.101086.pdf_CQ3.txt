Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and correcting sampling bias, and it discusses methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) for representing pixels in environmental variable space. There is no mention of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
