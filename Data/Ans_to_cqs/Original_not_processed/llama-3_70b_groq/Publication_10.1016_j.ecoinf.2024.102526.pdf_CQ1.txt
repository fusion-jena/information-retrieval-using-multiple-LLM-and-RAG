Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve various forms of imaging and sampling protocols. The context mentions the use of 3D cameras, calibrated cameras, laser markers, and optical flow for data collection. Additionally, it references the use of bait, mapping, and surveying methods, as well as ex-situ imaging of samples taken by other methods.

The context also mentions the use of different types of imagery, including photo, video, and scan, and different environments, such as seafloor, water column, sea surface, atmosphere, and laboratory. It also references the use of different light spectrums, including sunlight, artificial light, and mixed light.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of camera exif data, including aperture, ISO, and shutter speed, as well as image pixel resolution and magnitude, and image field of view. It also references the use of UTC timestamps and decimal degrees for location and depth information.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of public datasets, it does provide a comprehensive overview of the various methods and protocols used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
