Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the processes followed to deploy it. The context appears to be discussing the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
