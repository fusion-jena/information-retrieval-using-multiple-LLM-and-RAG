Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is based on the proportion of the total data. In this case, the data is split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation. This is evident from the code snippet where the validation dataset is created using the `filter` function with the condition `between(row_number(), floor(n()*80/100) + 1, n())`. This means that the first 80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20% is used for validation. There is no mention of a test set in the provided context.
