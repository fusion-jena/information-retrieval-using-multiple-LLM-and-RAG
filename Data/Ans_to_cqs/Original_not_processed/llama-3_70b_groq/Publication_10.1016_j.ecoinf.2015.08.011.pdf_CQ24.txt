Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention some techniques to avoid overfitting, which is related to randomness in the model training process.

One strategy mentioned is early stopping, which involves stopping the training process when the model begins to overfit the data, as indicated by the error on the validation set. This helps to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and improves its generalization capabilities.

Another strategy mentioned is the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate. This involves varying these parameters and selecting the combination that results in the best model performance, as measured by the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data.

While these strategies do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do help to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, which can be affected by randomness in the training process.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it does mention some strategies that can help to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, which can be related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
