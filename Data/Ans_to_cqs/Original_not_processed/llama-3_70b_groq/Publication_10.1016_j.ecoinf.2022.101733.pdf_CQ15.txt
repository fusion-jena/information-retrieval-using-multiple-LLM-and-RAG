Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on support vector machines (SVM) and remote sensing applications, with mentions of SVM parameters, kernel types, and feature extraction. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
