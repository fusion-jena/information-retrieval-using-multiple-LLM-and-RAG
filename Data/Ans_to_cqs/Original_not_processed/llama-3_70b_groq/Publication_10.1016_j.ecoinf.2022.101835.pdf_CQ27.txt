Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM models using Optuna, and the evaluation of their performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). It also explains the calculation of SHAP values to understand the machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
