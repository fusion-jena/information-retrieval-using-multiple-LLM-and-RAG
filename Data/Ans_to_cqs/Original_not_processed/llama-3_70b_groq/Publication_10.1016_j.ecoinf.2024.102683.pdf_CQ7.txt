Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the data is split into five equal folds in the proposed FAA-based approach (Fig. 3). It also provides a table (Table 1) that reports how to split the data for training and testing of the proposed models, but the specific criteria used for this split are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
