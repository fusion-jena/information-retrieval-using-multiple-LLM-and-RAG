Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the approach "required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps" which suggests that the model may not have required any preprocessing steps. But this is not a clear indication of what preprocessing steps were or were not involved. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
