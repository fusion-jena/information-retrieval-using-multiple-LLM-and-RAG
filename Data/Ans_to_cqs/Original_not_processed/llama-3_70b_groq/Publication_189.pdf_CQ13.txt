Answer::: 

The provided context mentions some hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it states that the learning rate, α, used for heads layer training is 0.001, and during all layers training, α decays by 10. However, it does not mention the optimizer used in the model. Therefore, the answer to the query is partial, and we can only provide the learning rate and its decay schedule, but not the optimizer.
