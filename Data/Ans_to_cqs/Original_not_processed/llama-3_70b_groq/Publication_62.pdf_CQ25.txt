Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The context mentions "image classification" and "superhuman performance" in the introduction, suggesting that the model is designed for classification tasks. Additionally, the tables provided (Table 1 and Table 2) describe the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for two different CNNs (unstained/stained CNN and clubmoss/spikemoss CNN), which are typical architectures for image classification problems. The output layers of these models are also consistent with classification tasks, with a SoftmaxLayer and a class output. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is image classification.
