Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of certain techniques that can help mitigate the effects of randomness, such as dropout and DropConnect.

 Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly discards the output of hidden nodes during training, which can help prevent overfitting and improve model robustness. DropConnect, on the other hand, randomly discards the input of hidden layers, which can also help improve model robustness.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of cyclical learning rates and early stopping, which can help improve model performance and reduce the impact of randomness. However, these techniques are not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, it does mention techniques that can help improve model robustness and performance, which can indirectly help mitigate the effects of randomness.
