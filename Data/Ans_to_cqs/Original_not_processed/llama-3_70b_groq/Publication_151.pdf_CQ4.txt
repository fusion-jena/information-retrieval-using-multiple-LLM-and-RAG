Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the DEPP method for phylogenetic placement, including the embedding size, CNN model training, and placement of query sequences onto a reference tree. It also discusses the evaluation of DEPP on simulated data sets and its performance compared to other methods. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
