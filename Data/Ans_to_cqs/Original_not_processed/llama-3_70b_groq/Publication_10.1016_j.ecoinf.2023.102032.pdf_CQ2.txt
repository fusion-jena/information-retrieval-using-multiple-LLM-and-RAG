Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on wetland use intensity in East Africa, using Sentinel-2 images and earth observation data. However, it does not provide specific information about the data formats used in the pipeline.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that image data (specifically, Sentinel-2 images) is likely used in the pipeline, but the exact format of these images (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified. There is no mention of audio or video data being used. CSV files might be used for storing metadata or other non-image data, but this is not explicitly stated.

In summary, while it can be inferred that image data is used, the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context.
