Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the various papers that focus on image-based species identification, facial recognition, and vegetation monitoring using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For instance, the paper by Zmarz et al. (2019) uses video data for chimpanzee face recognition, while the paper by Barr√© et al. (2017) uses images for automatic plant species identification. Additionally, the paper by Clapham et al. (2020) uses images for automated facial recognition of brown bears.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that these formats may be used in certain applications, but it is not evident from the provided context.

It is also worth noting that CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not typically used as input data formats for deep learning models. CSV files are commonly used for storing and exchanging tabular data, such as numerical or categorical data, but they are not typically used for image or audio data.

In summary, based on the provided context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
