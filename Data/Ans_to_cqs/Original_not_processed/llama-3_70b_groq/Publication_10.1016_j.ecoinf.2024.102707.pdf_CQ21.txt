Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance, results, and references to other studies. It does mention the calculation of F1 scores, which is a metric used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

However, it is common in machine learning workflows to calculate various metrics, including confusion matrices, after model training to evaluate the model's performance. Saliency maps are also a common technique used to interpret the model's predictions, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
