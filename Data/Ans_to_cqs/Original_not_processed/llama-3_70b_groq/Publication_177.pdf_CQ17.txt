Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Bayesian optimization to find optimal hyperparameters, such as batch size and initial learning rate, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "regularization strength" as one of the variables that can be optimized using Bayesian optimization. This suggests that some form of regularization is being used, but the specific method is not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
