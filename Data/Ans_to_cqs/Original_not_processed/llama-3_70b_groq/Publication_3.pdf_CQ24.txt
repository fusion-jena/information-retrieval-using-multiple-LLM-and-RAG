Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of TensorFlow for species identification using acoustic signals, discussing the results of various classification challenges, and exploring avenues for future development. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning pipeline or strategies for managing randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
