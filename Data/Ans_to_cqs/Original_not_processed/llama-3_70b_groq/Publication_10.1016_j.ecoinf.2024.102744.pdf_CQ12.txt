Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the classification network architecture, which includes convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. The use of convolutional layers and max pooling layers is a characteristic of CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the mention of filter sizes and strides in the context also suggests the use of a CNN. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
