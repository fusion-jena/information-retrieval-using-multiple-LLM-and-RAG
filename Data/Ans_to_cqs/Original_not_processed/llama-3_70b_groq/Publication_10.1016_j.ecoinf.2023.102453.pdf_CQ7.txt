Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation, and neural architecture search. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, these details are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
