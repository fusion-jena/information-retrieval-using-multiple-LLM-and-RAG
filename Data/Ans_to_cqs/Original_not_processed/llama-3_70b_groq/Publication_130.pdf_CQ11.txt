Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions a GitHub link (github.com/AndreCFerreira/Bird_individualID) which provides a detailed explanation of the developed setup, but it does not seem to be a data repository link. The context focuses on the procedures for automating the collection of training data, generating training datasets, and training CNNs for individual bird identification, but it does not provide information about a data repository link.
