Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses the use of transfer learning, multipart loss function, and weighting to improve the model's accuracy, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
