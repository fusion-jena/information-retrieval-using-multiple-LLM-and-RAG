Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the SILIC framework, animal sound databases, and the challenges of developing an autonomous wildlife sound identifier, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
