Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on text processing and analysis, including data cleaning, Chinese text segmentation, and theme perception technology using machine learning models like ERNIE and LDA. There is no mention of computer vision-related tasks or annotation techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines for image or object detection tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
