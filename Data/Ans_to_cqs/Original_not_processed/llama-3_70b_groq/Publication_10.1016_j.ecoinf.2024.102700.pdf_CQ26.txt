Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on ecological informatics, species habitat use, and the use of machine learning techniques such as Maxent and deep learning strategies. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias addressing techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of "regularisation multiplier" in the Maxent model to find a proper trade-off between flexibility and overfitting. This could be related to addressing bias or overfitting in the model, but it is not directly related to the specific techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection).

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not addressed in the given text.
