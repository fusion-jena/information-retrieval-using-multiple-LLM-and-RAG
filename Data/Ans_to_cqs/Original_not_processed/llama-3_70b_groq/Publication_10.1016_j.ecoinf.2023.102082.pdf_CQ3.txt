Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for creating high-resolution CHMs, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used for training the CNN models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
