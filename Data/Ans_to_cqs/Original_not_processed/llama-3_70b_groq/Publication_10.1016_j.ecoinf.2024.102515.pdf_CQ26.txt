Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data acquisition and processing of tweets for biodiversity observations, highlighting the challenges of working with Twitter data, such as the low quality of tweets and the need for cleaning and filtering processes.

However, it can be inferred that the authors have used some form of filtering process to reduce invalid tweets, as shown in Fig. 1, which might help mitigate some data bias issues. Additionally, the authors have used a supervised approach, as mentioned in the "Data availability" section, which might imply that they have attempted to collect a diverse dataset. Nevertheless, the context does not provide explicit information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
