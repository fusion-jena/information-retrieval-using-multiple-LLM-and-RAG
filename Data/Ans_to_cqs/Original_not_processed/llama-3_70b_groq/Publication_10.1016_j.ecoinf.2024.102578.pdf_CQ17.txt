Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the workflow and model training for image quality classification, but it does not provide information about regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. 

However, it does mention the use of a one-cycle learning rate policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001, which is a hyperparameter controlling the model's response to estimated error each time the model weights are updated. This could be related to regularization, but it is not a direct answer to the query.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
