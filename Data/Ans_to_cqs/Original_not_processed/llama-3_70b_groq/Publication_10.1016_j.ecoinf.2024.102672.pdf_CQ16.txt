Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the training is complete when the loss curve stabilizes in the four folds of the cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as "the number of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guaranteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross-validation." This suggests that the training is stopped when the loss curve reaches a plateau, indicating that the model has converged and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.
