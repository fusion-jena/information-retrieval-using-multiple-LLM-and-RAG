Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the importance of considering scale sensitivity in image analysis, segmentation, and classification strategies in eCognition, and the potential of machine learning techniques in improving image classification. It does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
