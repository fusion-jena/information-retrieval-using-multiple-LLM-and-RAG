Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, machine learning, and pine wilt disease, with discussions on random forest, maximum entropy modeling, and ensemble models. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
