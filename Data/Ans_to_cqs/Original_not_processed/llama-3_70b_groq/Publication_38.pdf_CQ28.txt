Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research papers and articles related to deep learning, environmental sound classification, and acoustic modeling, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
