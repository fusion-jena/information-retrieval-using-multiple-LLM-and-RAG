Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, it is mentioned that "we used a dropout of 50% and an Adam Solver type as learning parameters" in the text. This indicates that dropout with a rate of 50% was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
