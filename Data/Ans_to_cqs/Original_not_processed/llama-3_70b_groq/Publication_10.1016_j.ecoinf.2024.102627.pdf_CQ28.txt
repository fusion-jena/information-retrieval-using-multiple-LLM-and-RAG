Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the model architecture, dataset spatial split, and training procedure in the supplementary information (SI) Box A, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
