Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology, urban planning, and wildlife conservation, with topics such as land cover classification, habitat suitability, and landscape fragmentation. There is no mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context. If you have any further information or context related to deep learning pipelines and data preprocessing, I may be able to help.
