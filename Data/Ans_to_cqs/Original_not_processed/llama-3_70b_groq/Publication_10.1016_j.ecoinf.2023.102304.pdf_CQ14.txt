Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the parameters are optimized, and the optimized parameters can improve the overall accuracy and kappa by up to 8.4% and 36.8%, respectively. It also mentions that parameter calibration is needed in LTR applications as it is a parameter-sensitive algorithm, and two parameters (Max Segments and Recovery Threshold) are selected for further evaluation. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
