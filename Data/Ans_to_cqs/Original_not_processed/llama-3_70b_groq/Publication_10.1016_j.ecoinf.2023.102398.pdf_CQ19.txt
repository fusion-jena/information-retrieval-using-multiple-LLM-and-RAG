Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of GPU (Tesla T4) and CUDA Version-12.0 in Google Colab, which suggests that the model is built using a framework that supports CUDA acceleration, but it does not specify which framework is used. The context also mentions YOLOv5, which is a deep learning model, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I cannot determine the framework used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
