Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this case study is classification and segmentation. The model is used to classify and segment features in high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. The U-Net architecture, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is implemented to extract spatial features and detect patterns independently of their position on the input image. The model is trained to perform pixel-wise classification and segmentation tasks, specifically for a particular segmentation task with features that might differ significantly from features learned by networks trained on common image datasets such as ImageNet.
