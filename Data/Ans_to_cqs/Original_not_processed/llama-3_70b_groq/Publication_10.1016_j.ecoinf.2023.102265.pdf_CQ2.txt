Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions that the input to the ResNet-50 model is an image of 224x224 pixels, and that the model is used for extracting image features for classification. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
