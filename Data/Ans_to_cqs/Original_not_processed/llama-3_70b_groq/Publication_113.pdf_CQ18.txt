Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer that the model performance is being monitored through the active learning pipeline.

In the pipeline, the classification model is fine-tuned on the entire labelled set of the target dataset after selecting 100 images using the active learning selection strategy and passing them to the human oracle for labelling. Additionally, the embedding model is fine-tuned on the entire labelled set of the target dataset every 2,000 active queries.

The performance of the model is also evaluated through the overall accuracy achieved by the classifier, which is reported to be 93.2% after the first 30,000 active queries. This suggests that the model performance is being monitored through the accuracy metric.

However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
