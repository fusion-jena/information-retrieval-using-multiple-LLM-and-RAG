Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the fine-tuning process, model performance, and the application of deep learning in wildlife conservation. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
