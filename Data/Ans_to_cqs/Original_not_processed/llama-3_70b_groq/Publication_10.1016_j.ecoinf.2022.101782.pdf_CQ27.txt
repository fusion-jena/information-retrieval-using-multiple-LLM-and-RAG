Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
