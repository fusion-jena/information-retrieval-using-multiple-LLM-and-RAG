Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the introduction, methodology, and results of the forest species classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral images. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
