Answer: 

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the value of Î³ (a hyper-parameter) is experimentally chosen and kept constant at 10% for all experiments of IFTL. There is no information about the optimization method used to select this value, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
