Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to a study on detecting ungulate vocalizations using automated signal recognition software, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
