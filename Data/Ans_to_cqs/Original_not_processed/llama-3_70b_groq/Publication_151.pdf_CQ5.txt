Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context appears to be discussing a phylogenetic placement method called DEPP, which uses a CNN model to map query sequences to a vector of distances. The datasets mentioned are simulated data sets, specifically a 200-taxon data set and a 10,000-taxon data set, but these are not typical deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
