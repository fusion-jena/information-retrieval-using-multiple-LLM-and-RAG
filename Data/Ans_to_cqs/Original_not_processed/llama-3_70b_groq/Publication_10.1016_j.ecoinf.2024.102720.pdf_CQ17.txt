Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions deep learning as one of the methods used in multi-scale data coupling research, but it does not provide specific details about regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention other machine learning methods, such as random forest, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks, which may use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine which of these methods are used in the context of the provided research.
