Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, particularly in camera trap images, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. It mentions the use of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation for instance segmentation of animal species, but it does not elaborate on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
