Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the TPEBO algorithm and its application to hyperparameter optimization for LSTM neural networks, but it does not mention TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
