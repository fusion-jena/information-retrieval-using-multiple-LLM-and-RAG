Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it describes a species assemblage model that uses a large environmental context around each observation, including WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). The model is trained on presence-only data, and the input features are 64 Ã— 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre-scale resolution and centred on the observation. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
