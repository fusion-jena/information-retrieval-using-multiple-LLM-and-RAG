Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific frameworks used to build them, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, shellfish farming, and valve gaping in organisms, with references to scientific studies and experiments. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, so it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build such a model.
