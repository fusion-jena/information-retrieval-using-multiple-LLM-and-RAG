Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Learning rate: 0.7
* Number of nodes in the hidden layer: 19
* Number of epochs: Not specified (but an early stopping technique was used to prevent overfitting)
* Optimizer: Not specified (but the context mentions the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal learning rate and number of neurons in the hidden layer)

Note that the context does not provide information about the optimizer used in the model.
