Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be an excerpt from a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references cited in the text are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
