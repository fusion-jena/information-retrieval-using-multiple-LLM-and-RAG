Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it mentions the use of machine-learning models, specifically Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are not deep learning models. These models are used in the BIOMOD2 package in R to generate a final ensembled model for each species. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which deep learning framework is used to build the model, as deep learning is not mentioned in the context.
