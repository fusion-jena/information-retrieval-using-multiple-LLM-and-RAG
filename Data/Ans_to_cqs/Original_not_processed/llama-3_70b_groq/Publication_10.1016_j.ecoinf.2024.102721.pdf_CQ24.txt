Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on a specific research article that utilizes deep learning methods to forecast ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. It discusses the use of LSTM models, Bayesian optimization, and SHAP values, but does not address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
