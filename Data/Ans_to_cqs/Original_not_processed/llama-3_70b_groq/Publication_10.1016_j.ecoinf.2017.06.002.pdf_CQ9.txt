Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. It discusses the NGEE Tropics project's data repository, called the NGEE Tropics Archive, which is a custom-built repository with a web portal and REST API. It does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF as options for the data repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
