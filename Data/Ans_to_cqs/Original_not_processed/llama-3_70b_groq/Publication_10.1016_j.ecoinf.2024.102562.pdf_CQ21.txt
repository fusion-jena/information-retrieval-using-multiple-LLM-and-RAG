Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text only discusses the importance of annotating dataset images, the process of preparing a larger dataset, and the results of the model training in terms of average precision and average recall. It also mentions the use of image augmentations during training, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
