Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) technique used to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters for a model, and the k-fold cross-validation method employed for model evaluation and assessment. 

It does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used to determine when the training process is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
