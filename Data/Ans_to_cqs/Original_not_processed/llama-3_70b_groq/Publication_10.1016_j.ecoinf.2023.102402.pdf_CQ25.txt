Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and their application in conservation biology, specifically for seahorses. The models mentioned are Maxent models, which are a type of species distribution model, not deep learning models. The purpose of these models is to predict the distribution of species based on environmental factors, but this is not related to deep learning.
