Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors are using a combination of techniques to monitor the model's performance.

Firstly, they are running experiments across a range of train-test set splits (80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80) to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and detect any signs of overfitting.

Secondly, they are using a fixed number of epochs (30) for all experiments, which suggests that they are monitoring the model's performance during training and stopping the training process when the model converges or reaches a plateau.

Lastly, the authors mention that they have aggregated plots (Figure 3) across all experiments, which implies that they are tracking the model's performance during training and plotting the results to visualize the learning curve.

While the exact strategy is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the authors are using a combination of techniques, including train-test set splits, fixed epochs, and performance tracking, to monitor the model's performance during training.
