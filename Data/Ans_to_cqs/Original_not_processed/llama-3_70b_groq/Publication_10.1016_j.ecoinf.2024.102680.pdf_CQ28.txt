Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the limitations of general deep learning networks for underwater optical images, the original YOLOv8 network, and the modifications made to it, such as using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. It also describes the input layer of the UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network) and the preprocessing operations performed on the input images. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deployment.
