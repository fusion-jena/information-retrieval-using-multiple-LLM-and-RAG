Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the implementation details of the Mask R-CNN model, including the backbone structures, anchor boxes, image and mask shapes, training epochs, and learning rate. It also mentions the use of data augmentation in a separate study (Poojary et al., 2020), but it does not provide information on how the dataset was split or if any cross-validation techniques were employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
