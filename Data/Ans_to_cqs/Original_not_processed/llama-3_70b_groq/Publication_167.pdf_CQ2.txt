Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the input data is a 40-dimensional data, which is processed using batch normalization. The data seems to be in a numerical format, possibly CSV or a similar tabular format, as it is mentioned that the input data includes features such as LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
