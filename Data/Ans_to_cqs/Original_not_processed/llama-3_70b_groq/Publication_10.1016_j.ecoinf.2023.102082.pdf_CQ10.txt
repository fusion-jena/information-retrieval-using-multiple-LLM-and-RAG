Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m). The context only mentions that the Lang10m was derived using a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022), but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
