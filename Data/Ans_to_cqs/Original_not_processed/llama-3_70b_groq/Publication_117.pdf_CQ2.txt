Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions "survey images" and "image resolution and sizes" which suggests that the input data is in the form of images. Additionally, the use of the YOLO DCNN (You Only Look Once Deep Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm, which is a popular object detection algorithm, further supports the idea that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as an input data format either.
