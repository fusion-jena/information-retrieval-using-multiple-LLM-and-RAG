Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for ungulate detection and vocalization, and mentions the importance of manual labeling of events to improve the accuracy of algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
