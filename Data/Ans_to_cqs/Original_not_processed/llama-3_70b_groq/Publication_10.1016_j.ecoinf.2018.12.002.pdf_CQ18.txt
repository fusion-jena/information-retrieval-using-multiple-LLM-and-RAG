Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches in inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. It highlights the limitations of supervised learning due to the lack of behavioral observations and the suitability of unsupervised learning for explanatory studies of novel behaviors or secretive species. However, it does not provide information on model performance monitoring during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
