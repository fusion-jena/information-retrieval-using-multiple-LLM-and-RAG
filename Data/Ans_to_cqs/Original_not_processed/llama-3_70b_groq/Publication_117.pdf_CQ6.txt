Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the process of generating a training dataset and preparing the images for object detection using a YOLO DCNN.

The context mentions that the survey images were tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This process created a list of locations of potential objects in each image. The results were then filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data.

While this information does not provide explicit details on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it suggests that the images were not significantly preprocessed before being fed into the YOLO DCNN. The model was likely used with its default settings and preprocessing steps, which are typically built into the model architecture.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on preprocessing steps, but it implies that the images were not heavily preprocessed before being used to train the deep learning model.
