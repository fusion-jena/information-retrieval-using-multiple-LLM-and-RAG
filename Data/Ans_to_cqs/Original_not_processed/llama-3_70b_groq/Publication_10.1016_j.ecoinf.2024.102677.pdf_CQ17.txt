Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the selection of CNN architectures, dataset division, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not specify any regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
