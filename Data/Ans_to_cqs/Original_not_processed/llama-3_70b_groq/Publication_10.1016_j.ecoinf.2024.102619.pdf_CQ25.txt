Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used to classify imagery, and the authors are comparing two approaches: a CNN+SVM approach and a CNN approach. The classification task involves training the models on a dataset and optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. The authors are using support vector machines (SVMs) as the classifier in the CNN+SVM approach and the CNN itself as the classifier in the CNN approach. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these two approaches in classifying imagery.
