Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a research study that proposes a comprehensive framework for addressing water contamination in aquaculture using IoT-based data collection and deep learning models. The study discusses the limitations of current deep learning approaches and proposes a novel attention-based AODEGRU model to classify water quality. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
