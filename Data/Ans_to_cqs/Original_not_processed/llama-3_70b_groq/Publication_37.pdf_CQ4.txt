Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are: adding background noise, dynamic range compression, pitch shifting, and time stretching. These augmentations are applied using the MUDA library. Specifically, the techniques used are:

* Adding background noise from 4 different field recordings captured at night containing geophony
* Dynamic range compression using 4 parameterizations: music, film, speech, and radio
* Pitch shifting by 4 conservative values of -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semitones, and 4 less conservative values of -2, -1, 1, 2 semitones
* Time stretching by 4 ratios: 0.81, 0.93, 1.07, 1.23

These techniques are used to increase the size of the training set and improve the performance of the CNN model.
