Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for classification, specifically for forest-type categorization. The model aims to classify different types of forests using high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment. This classification is necessary to enhance the performance of the fire risk prediction model, as different forest types have varying levels of susceptibility to wildfires.
