Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the architectures of different deep learning models such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and their performance on a specific task. It also mentions the use of PCA-NCA integration in Approaches 1 and 3, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
