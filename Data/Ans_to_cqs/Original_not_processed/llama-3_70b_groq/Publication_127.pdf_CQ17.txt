Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some deep learning architectures and techniques, such as ResNet, AlexNet, and sequence-to-sequence learning, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, batch normalization, and data augmentation. However, these methods are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
