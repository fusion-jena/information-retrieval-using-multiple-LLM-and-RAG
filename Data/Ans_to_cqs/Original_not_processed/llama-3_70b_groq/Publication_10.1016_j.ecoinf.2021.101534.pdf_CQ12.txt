Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, where it is stated that "Compared with previous CNN-based approaches..." and "...developing an autonomous wildlife sound identifier using a CNN-based classifier...". This indicates that the model used is a CNN-based model, specifically designed for image classification tasks, which in this case is applied to spectrograms converted from audio clips.
