Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the implementation of a K-fold cross-validation technique, random under sampling (RUS) to address imbalances, and the use of neural networks (NN) for classification and regression tasks. However, it does not specify any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
