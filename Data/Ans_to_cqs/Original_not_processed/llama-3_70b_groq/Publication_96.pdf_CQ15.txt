Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the training process, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
