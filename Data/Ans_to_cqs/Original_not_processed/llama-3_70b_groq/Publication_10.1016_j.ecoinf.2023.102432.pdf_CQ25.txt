Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically MTMI-SMF, is classification. It is designed to classify pixels in remote sensing images as either containing an invasive species or not. The model is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching with image pixels. The model groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have an invader and assigns a confidence value to each pixel. The confidence values are then compared to a threshold to determine the classification result.
