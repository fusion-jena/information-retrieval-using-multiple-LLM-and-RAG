Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears that the dataset used is a custom dataset of bird songs, where each song is represented as a spectrogram image. The context mentions that the dataset is divided into folders labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected, and each folder contains the corresponding bird song files. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the datasets mentioned in the query (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) are used in this specific deep learning pipeline.
