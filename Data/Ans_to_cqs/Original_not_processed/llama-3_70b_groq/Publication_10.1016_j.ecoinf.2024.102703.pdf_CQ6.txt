Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training the back propagation (BP) artificial neural network model. The context only describes the architecture of the model, the input and output layers, the training parameters, and the evaluation metrics used. It does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
