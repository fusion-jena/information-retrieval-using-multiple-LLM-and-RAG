Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mentioned applications and models, it can be inferred that the deep learning models are used for tasks such as classification, forecasting, and prediction.

For instance, the context mentions the use of LSTM models for sequential data tasks, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. This suggests that the LSTM models are used for classification and prediction tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of RF models for forecasting ENSO, which implies that the RF models are used for prediction tasks. The comparison of RF models with Lasso models also suggests that the purpose of the RF models is to make predictions or forecasts.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
