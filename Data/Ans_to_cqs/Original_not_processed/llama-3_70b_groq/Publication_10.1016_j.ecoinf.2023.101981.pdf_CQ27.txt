Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the acoustic monitoring of cow vocalizations using Song Meter SM2 recorders and the analysis of the collected data. It discusses the settings used for recording and detecting cow vocalizations, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
