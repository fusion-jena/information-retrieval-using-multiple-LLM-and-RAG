Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training efficiency, EarthNetScore benchmarking, and the data used for the challenge. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be involved after the model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
