Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including spatial cross-validation, feature elimination techniques (RFE and VSURF), and the use of specific packages in R programming (Caret and VSURF). 

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, as it is mentioned as the termination condition for the RFE algorithm. 

No information is provided about the calculation of other metrics, creation of saliency maps, or the generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
