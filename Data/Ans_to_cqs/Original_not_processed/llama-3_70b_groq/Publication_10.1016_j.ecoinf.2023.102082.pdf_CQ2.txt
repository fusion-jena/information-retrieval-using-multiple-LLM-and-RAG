Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses Sentinel-2 optical images as input data. This is mentioned in the sentence "created using Sentinel-2 images and a deep learning convolutional neural network." Additionally, it is mentioned that Lang10m was derived by fusing GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be optical images, specifically Sentinel-2 images.
