The purpose of the deep learning model in this case study is classification. Specifically, it is used for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images. The model is trained on a dataset of labelled images and validated with a new dataset of unlabelled images. The goal is to automate the identification of species in images, which is a common task in ecology.
