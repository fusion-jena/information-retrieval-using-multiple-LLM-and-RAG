Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

* Image scaling
* Horizontal and vertical flip
* Perspective distortion
* Adding color jitter for brightness, contrast, and saturation.

These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and mitigate overfitting.
