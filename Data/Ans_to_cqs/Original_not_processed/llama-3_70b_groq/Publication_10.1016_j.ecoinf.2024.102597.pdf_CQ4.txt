Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. In fact, it mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. There is no further discussion about deep learning pipelines or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
