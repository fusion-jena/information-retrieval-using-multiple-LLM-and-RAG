Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the model's structure, the importance of feature selection, and the advantages of using LSTM-based methods, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
