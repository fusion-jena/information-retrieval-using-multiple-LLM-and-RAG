Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, the architecture of AlexNet, and some general concepts related to deep learning. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
