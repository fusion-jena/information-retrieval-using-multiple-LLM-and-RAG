Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it discusses the general approach to splitting data for model training and evaluation in machine learning. According to the context, when data are abundant, a common approach is to randomly divide the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set.

The criteria for splitting the data are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the split is typically done randomly. The purpose of each set is:

* Training set: used for fitting the models
* Validation set: used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning
* Test set: used for assessing the accuracy of the final model

In the context of k-fold cross-validation, the full dataset is split into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds, where each fold is used for testing and the remaining folds are used for training. The folds are chosen randomly.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning models, and it is possible that deep learning models may require different splitting strategies or criteria.
