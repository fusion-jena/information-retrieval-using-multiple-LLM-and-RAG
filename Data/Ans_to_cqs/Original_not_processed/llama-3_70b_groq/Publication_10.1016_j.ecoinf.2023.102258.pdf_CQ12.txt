Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that various deep learning models are used in different pipelines. Specifically, the following models are mentioned:

* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): This model is mentioned in several pipelines, including Lin, Tang et al. (2021), Liu_Surrey, and You et al. (2023).
* CNN (ResNet): This is a specific type of CNN architecture used in the Wu_SHNU pipeline.
* CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network): This model is used in the CNN + CRNN + Perceiver pipeline.
* Perceiver: This is a type of deep learning model used in the Wolters 2021 arxiv pipeline and the CNN + CRNN + Perceiver pipeline.
* R-CRNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network): This model is used in the Proto + RPN pipeline.
* Proto: This is a type of prototypical network used in several pipelines, including Yang et al. (2021), Lin + PCEN, and Du_NERCSLIP.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a single, unified answer to the query, as different pipelines employ different deep learning models.
