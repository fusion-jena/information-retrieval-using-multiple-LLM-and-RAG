Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the models used, their architectures, and the experimental setup, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
