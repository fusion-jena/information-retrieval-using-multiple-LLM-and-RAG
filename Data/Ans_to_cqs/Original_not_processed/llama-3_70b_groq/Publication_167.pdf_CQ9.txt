Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and components of the land use change (LUCC) reconstruction framework, including the data module (DM), probability module (PM), and simulation module (SM), but it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
