Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process using randomized grid search methods and presents the resulting hyperparameter values for different machine learning models. It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
