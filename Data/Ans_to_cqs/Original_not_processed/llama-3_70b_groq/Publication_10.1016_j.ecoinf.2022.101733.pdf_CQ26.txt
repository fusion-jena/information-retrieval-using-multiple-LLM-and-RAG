Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the samples were selected according to a 60%â€“40% ratio for training and validation, and that the sample's class proportions are typical of the landscape's real class proportions. It also mentions that the analyst must make methodological decisions that present tradeoffs in data quality (i.e., class representativeness) and quantity while creating training data for RS image classification. However, it does not specify the techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this context, as it is not mentioned.
