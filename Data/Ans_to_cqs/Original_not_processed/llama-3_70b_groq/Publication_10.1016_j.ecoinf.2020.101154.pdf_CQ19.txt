Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. The context discusses the use of Generalized Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), but it does not provide information about the deep learning framework used. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
