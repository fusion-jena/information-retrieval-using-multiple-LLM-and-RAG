Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were performed on the remote sensing image data.

The context mentions "remote sensing image pre-processing" which includes geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. Additionally, it is mentioned that the Digital Number (DN) of the original image was used to calculate the Surface Reflectance (SR).

Although the context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation was performed to convert the raw image data into a usable format for analysis. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, but it is likely that some form of data preparation was performed on the remote sensing image data.
