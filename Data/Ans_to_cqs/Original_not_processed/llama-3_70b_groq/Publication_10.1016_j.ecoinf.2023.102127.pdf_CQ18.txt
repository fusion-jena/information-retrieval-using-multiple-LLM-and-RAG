Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the challenges of model evaluation in the context of model-based integration, where biases and sampling methods can differ, and validation datasets might not represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated by the integrated model. It also mentions that withholding parts of the training data for validating a model can lead to biased results.

However, it does mention the use of validation metrics such as True Skill Statistics (TSS) using the "modEvA" R-package, and thresholding with minimum presence values or fixed/percentile values to evaluate the model performance. But these are not specifically mentioned as strategies to monitor model performance during training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this query.
