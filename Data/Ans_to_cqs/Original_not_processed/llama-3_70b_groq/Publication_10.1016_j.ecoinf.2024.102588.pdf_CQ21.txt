Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to artificial intelligence, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks, but it does not provide specific information about postprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention some general concepts related to model training, such as adjusting the learning rate and using early stopping to determine the optimum point for the best performance of the CNN model. But it does not elaborate on the postprocessing steps that may be involved after the model training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
