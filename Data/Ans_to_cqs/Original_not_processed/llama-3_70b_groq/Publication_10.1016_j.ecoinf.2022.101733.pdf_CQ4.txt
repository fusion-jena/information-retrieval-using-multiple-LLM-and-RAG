Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, feature selection, and classification using support vector machines (SVM), but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
