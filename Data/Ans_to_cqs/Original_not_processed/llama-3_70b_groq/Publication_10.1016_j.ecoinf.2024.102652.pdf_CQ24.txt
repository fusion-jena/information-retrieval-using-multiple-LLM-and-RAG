Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, training process, and loss function used in the deep learning model for assessing and segmenting salt-affected soils. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
