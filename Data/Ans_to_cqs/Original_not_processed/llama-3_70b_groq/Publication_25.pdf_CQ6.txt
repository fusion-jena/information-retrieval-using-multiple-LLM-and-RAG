Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, the need for large training datasets, and the potential of semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning to address these challenges.

It does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
