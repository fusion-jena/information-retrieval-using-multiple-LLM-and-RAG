Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the relationship between industrialization, carbon emissions, and GDP, and proposes a novel transfer learning methodology to predict GDP using carbon emission data. It also mentions the use of deep CNN to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
