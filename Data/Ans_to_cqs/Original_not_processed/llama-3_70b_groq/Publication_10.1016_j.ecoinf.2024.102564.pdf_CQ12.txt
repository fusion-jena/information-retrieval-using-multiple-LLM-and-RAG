Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a deep learning model. The context mentions an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which is a type of machine learning model, but it does not specify a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The ANN mentioned is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer, which is a type of feedforward neural network.
