Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architectures and their performance, such as ResNetV50, InceptionNetV3, EfÔ¨ÅcientNetB0, and DenceNet121, without mentioning the framework used to implement them. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
