Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant trait prediction, transfer learning, and the combination of image and bioclimatic data. It also mentions the use of pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on the ImageNet dataset.

However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
