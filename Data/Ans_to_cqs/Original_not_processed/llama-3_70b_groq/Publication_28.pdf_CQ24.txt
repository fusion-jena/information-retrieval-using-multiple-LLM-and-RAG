Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does discuss the "reparameterization trick" in the context of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This trick is used to handle stochastic input in the network by transferring the sampling to the input layer. 

In the context of VAEs, the reparameterization trick involves sampling from a standard normal distribution (ε ~ N(0, I)) and then transforming the sample using the mean and covariance of the latent variable (z|x) to obtain a sample from the desired distribution (pmodel(z|x) = μ(x) + θ^(1/2)(x) * ε). This allows the network to backpropagate through the sampling process and learn the parameters of the distribution.

While this trick is used to handle stochasticity in VAEs, it does not directly address the issue of random seed values in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
