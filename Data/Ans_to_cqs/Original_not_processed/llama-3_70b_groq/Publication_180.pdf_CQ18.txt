Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to consider two factors: 1) correct identification rate, and 2) processing time. The correct identification rate is monitored to see how well the model is performing in terms of accuracy, and the processing time is monitored to see how long it takes to train the model. The optimal number of training steps is chosen based on the point where the correct identification rate plateaus, and the processing time increases significantly. This is evident in the Mexican dataset, where 2,000 training steps were chosen as the optimum, resulting in an 83.0% overall identification rate, and in the Brazilian dataset, where 12,000 training steps were chosen, resulting in an 86.7% overall identification rate.
