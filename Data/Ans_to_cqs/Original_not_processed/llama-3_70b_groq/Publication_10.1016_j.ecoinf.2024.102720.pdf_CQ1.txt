Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, environmental sustainability, and research papers, but it does not provide specific information about data collection methods for deep learning.

The context mentions "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm" in the first line, but it does not elaborate on how the data for this algorithm was collected. The rest of the context is focused on research papers, funding, and acknowledgments, without providing any information about data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
