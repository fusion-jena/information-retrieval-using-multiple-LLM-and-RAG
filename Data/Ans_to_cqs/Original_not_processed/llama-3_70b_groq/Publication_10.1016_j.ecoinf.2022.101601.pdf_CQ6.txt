Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and permafrost modeling, and it discusses model pre-validation, node renaming, and refinement, as well as various variables related to soil, vegetation, and atmospheric conditions. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
