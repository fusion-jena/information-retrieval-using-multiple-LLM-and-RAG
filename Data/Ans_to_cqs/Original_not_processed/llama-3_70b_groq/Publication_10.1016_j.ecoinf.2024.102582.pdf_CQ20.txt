Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform for remote sensing image classification, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources used for training the model. The context focuses on the application of GEE for large-scale land cover dynamic monitoring, mangrove extraction, and other remote sensing tasks, but it does not delve into the details of the hardware infrastructure used for model training.
