Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning using the Hyperband algorithm and the architecture of a neural network. It discusses the process of searching for the best hyperparameters, but it does not touch on the topic of data preprocessing or bias mitigation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
