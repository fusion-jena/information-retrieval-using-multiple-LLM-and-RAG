Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being used to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was tested on multiple datasets, as shown in Figure 10, which compares the accuracies of different classifiers for all datasets. This suggests that the model was evaluated on multiple datasets, but it is unclear whether these datasets were diverse or if any specific techniques were used to ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context provides details about the performance of the model on a specific dataset, including the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa, but it does not provide information on how the model was trained or validated.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
