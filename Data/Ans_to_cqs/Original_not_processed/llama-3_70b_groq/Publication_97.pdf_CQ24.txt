Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization [59] and dropout [60] techniques, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

Batch normalization helps reduce internal covariate shift, which can be caused by random initialization of weights and biases. Dropout, on the other hand, is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training, which can help prevent overfitting and reduce the impact of randomness.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Python generator to create a stream of almost never-repeated sub-images for training, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training data.

However, it does not mention the use of a fixed random seed value, which is a common strategy employed to ensure reproducibility of results in deep learning experiments.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include batch normalization and dropout, but it does not provide information on the use of a fixed random seed value.
