Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the 3-phase processing pipeline for training the network, including classification, segmentation, and plant cover prediction. It also discusses the motivation behind the segmentation pre-training approach and its advantages.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "class activation mapping" in the first phase of the pipeline, which is a technique used to generate weak segmentation maps. This might be related to saliency maps, but it is not explicitly stated as a postprocessing step.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
