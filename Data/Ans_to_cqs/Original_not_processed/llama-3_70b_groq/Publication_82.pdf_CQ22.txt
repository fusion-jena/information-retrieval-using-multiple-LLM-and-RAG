Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It only mentions "overall accuracy" as a basic result that can be replicated using a standard instance of Caffe. However, it does not provide further details on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, I don't know the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model beyond overall accuracy.
