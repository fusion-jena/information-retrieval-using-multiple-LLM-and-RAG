Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method used in this deep learning pipeline involves the use of hydrophones to record audio signals. Specifically, the context mentions that the recordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 m, with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. This suggests that the raw data is collected through underwater acoustic recordings.

It is also mentioned that the recordings were collected at the SWAMS site, located in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island, as part of the OHASISBIO program. However, there is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is through the use of hydrophones to record audio signals in underwater environments.
