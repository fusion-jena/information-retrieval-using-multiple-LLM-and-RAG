Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Top-k accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correct matches within the top-k predicted matches, where k = 1, 5, and 10.

2. Precision-Recall performance curves: These curves are used to evaluate the model's accuracy and detection success. The Average Precision (AP) is calculated as the area under the curve.

3. Average Precision (AP): This metric summarizes the accuracy of the model. In the context, the best-performing configuration achieves an AP of 94.45%.

No mention of recall as a standalone metric is made in the provided context. However, it is mentioned as part of the Precision-Recall performance curves.
