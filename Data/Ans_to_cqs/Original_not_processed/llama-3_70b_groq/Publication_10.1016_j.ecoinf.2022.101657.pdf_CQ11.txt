Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the GBIF database, which contains over 2300 videos of animals, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository for the pipeline. The context also mentions that the authors have curated a subset of 330 videos and provided a training and validation split, but it does not provide information on where this data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
