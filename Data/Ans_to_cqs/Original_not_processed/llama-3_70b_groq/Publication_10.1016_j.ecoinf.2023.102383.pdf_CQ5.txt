Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection tasks, particularly in the context of animal recognition and counting. It mentions various models such as ResNet152FPN, ResNet18FPN, and ResNet34FPN, but does not specify the datasets used to train these models.

The context does reference some papers and publications, but these references do not provide information about the specific datasets used. For example, the paper "YOLOv4: optimal speed and accuracy of object detection" by Bochkovskiy et al. (2020) is mentioned, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
