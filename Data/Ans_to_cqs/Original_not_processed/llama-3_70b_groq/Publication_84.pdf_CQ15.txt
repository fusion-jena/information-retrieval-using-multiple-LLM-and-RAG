Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the comparison of deep learning methods (Stacked AutoEncoder, SAE) with traditional machine learning methods (Support Vector Machine, SVM) for Landsat image classification, and the application of phenological knowledge to improve the performance of deep learning. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
