Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the number of epochs used for training the two CNN networks, which were 5 and 6 epochs, respectively. Additionally, it mentions the batch size and initial learning rate used during training.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, as was the case in this context.
* Early stopping: Training can be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
* Convergence of metrics: Training can be stopped when the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy or F1-score, converge or reach a desired threshold.

However, without explicit information, it is unclear which specific criterion was used to determine when training was complete in this particular case.
