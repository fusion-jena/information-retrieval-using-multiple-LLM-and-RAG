Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions TensorFlow as a reference in the references section, but it does not indicate that it was used as the deployment platform. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library, not a cloud platform. The context focuses on the architecture and methodology of the deep learning model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
