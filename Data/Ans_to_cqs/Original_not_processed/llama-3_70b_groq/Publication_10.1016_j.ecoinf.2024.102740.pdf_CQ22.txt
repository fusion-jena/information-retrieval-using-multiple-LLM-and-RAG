Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on random forest (RF) technique, which is a machine learning approach, not deep learning. It discusses the tuning strategies for RF, its application in remote sensing, and its use in estimating forage quantity and quality of semi-natural grasslands. 

However, it does mention the use of "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples to generate an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error in the context of RF. But it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
