Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Model Evaluation: The quality of the model is evaluated by comparing the predictions with the ground truth, which is a set of boxes drawn and labeled by a human expert.

2. Metrics calculation: The metrics of model quality are based on the class labels and their associated confidence scores. The following metrics are calculated: 
   - False positives (FP)
   - False negatives (FN)
   - True positives (TP)

3. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, the calculation of FP, FN, and TP implies the creation of a confusion matrix.

No mention is made of Saliency maps as a postprocessing step. It is possible that it might be involved in other deep learning models, but it is not mentioned in this specific context.

Note that the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps that might be involved, such as data augmentation, thresholding, or visualization of results.
