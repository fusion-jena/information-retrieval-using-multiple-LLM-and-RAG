Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in bird species recognition, feature extraction methods, and classification models. It discusses the use of various techniques like Chirplet transform, STFT, Mel cepstrum transform, and CNN for feature learning, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
