Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are stationary TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) and mobile laser scanning (MLS), including PLS (Plane-based Laser Scanning). These ground-based systems are used for data collection, feature extraction, and parameter estimation. 

It is also mentioned that the dataset used in this study includes single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and other data types, which suggests that the data collection process involves capturing point cloud data and images of trees using laser scanning technology.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which is a public dataset, for training some of the models. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys were used for collecting raw data.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are stationary TLS and mobile laser scanning (MLS), including PLS, as well as the use of public datasets like MNIST.
