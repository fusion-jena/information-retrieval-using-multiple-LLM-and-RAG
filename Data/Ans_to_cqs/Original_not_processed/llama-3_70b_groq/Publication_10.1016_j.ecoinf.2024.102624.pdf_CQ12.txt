Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text discusses the classification of input datasets using three classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). It also mentions the use of training data augmentation and post-classification techniques to improve classification accuracy. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
