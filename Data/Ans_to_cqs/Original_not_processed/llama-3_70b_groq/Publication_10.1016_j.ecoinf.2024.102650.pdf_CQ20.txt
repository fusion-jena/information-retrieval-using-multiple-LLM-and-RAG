Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be related to topic modeling and natural language processing, specifically discussing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its application to text generation. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
