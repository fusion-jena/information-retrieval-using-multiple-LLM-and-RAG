Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of deep learning models for predicting diving locations of birds, but it does not provide details on how the data was annotated or prepared for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
