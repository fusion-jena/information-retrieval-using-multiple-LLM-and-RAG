Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the applications of machine learning and deep learning in ecology and conservation biology, citing various studies and papers on the topic. While it mentions the use of deep learning and machine learning techniques, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
