Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation in aquaculture, discussing the importance of high-quality images and the use of deep neural networks for automated biomass estimation. 

While it is common practice to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a deep learning model, these specific steps are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
