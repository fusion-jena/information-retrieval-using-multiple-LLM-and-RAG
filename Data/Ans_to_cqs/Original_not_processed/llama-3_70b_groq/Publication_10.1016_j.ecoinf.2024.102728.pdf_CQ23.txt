Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and descriptions of various datasets, software, and methodologies used in different studies, but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning model or its development process.

The references provided are related to object retrieval with deep convolutional networks, emergent properties, cultural Mediterranean landscapes, inductive bias of deep convolutional networks, archaeological surveys, flora of Israel, vegetation of Israel, land cover classification systems, and GIS software. However, none of these references provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
