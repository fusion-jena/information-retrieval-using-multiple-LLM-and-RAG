Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The text appears to be discussing a process network approach using TPINet and information theory-based transfer entropy for network generation, and it provides details on data collection and processing, but it does not mention deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
