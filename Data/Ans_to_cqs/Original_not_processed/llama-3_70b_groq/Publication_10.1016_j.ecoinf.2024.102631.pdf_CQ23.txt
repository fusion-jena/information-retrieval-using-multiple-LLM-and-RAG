Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was evaluated on three different datasets: UCCS, C-60, and U45. This suggests that the authors attempted to test the model's performance on diverse datasets, which can contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the experiment settings section mentions that the authors maintained consistency by using source codes provided by authors or referring to original paper descriptions, and all methods underwent identical testing and training processes. This implies that the authors tried to ensure fairness and comparability in their evaluation, which can also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific measures were taken.
