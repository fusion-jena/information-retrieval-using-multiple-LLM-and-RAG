Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the processing and analysis of bird vocalization data using deep neural networks, discussing various techniques such as learnable frontends, time-frequency representations, and waveform inputs. It also references previous studies on bird species recognition and related tasks, but does not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context assumes that the data is already available and focuses on the processing and analysis stages, without discussing the data collection process.
