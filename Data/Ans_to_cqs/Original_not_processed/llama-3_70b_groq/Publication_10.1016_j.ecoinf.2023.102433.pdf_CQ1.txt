Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline involves remote sensing data from satellite images. Specifically, the DataHarvester component is capable of detecting new satellite images from the space agency database and downloading the data using internal scripts. This suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite imagery from space agencies such as NASA.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Python packages such as landsatxplore and Sentinelsat, which are used to interface with the USGS's Inventory Service API and the ESA Copernicus Open Access Hub, respectively. These packages are used to search, download, and retrieve metadata of satellite images, further supporting the notion that remote sensing data is the primary method of raw data collection.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods of raw data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary method of raw data collection in this deep learning pipeline is through remote sensing data from satellite images.
