Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery, specifically PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) data, which has a specific format that includes spatial resolution, spectral band, interval in PSI, and chronological order of each band. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the target PSI has the same format as the trained PSI and that the classification part uses a deep learning model trained based on the results of previous steps.
