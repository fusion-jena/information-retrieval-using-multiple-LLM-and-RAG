Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions "Deep Convolutional Networks" and "Pooling Geometry" in the reference by Cohen and Shashua (2017), but it does not specify the framework used to implement these concepts. The other references provided are related to ecology, archaeology, and data sources, but they do not provide information about the framework used for building the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the deep learning model.
