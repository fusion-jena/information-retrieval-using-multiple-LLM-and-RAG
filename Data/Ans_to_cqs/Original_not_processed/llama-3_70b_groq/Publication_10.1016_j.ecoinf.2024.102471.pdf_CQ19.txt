Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses various architectures and models, including Wav2vec, Hybrid CNN-LSTM, and Vision Transformer, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
