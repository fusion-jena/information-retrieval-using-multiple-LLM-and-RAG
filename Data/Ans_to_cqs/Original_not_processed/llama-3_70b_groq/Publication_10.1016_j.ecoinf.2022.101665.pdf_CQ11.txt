Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to climate and environmental data, and it provides links to various sources such as CHELSA, SoilGrids, and Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
