Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a classification table (confusion matrix). 

In Table 4, a classification table is presented, which shows the observed and forecasted values of the target variable, along with the correct percentage and overall percentage. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of the correct prediction rate for "present" and "absent" samples, as well as the overall validation accuracy. This implies that the model's performance is being evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps are involved in the postprocessing of the model.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a classification table (confusion matrix), but it is unclear whether other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps are involved.
