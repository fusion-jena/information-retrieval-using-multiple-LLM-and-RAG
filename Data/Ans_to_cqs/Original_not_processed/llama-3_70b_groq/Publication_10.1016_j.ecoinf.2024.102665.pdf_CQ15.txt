Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to marine biology and ecology, with references to coral reefs, fish, and benthic communities. The only mention of optimization is in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), which combines a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of spotted butterfish. However, the specific optimization technique used is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
