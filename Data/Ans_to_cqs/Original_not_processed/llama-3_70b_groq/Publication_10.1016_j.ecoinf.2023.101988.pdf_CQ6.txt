Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to unmanned aircraft systems, wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring, with references to various research papers and publications. However, it does not provide specific information on deep learning model preprocessing steps.

That being said, in general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming features to have similar magnitudes, often using techniques like standardization or feature scaling
* Data transformation: converting data types, handling categorical variables, and performing feature engineering
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

However, without specific information on the deep learning model and the dataset being used, it is difficult to provide more detailed preprocessing steps.
