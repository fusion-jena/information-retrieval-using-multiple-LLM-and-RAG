Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different frontend models and the impact of various techniques such as data augmentation, standardization, and min-max normalization on their performance. It also mentions that the hyperparameters of the learnable frontends were not exhaustively searched, and the kernel and hop sizes were fixed. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
