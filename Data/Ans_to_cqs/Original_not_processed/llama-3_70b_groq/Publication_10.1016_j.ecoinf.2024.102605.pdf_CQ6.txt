Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, with a focus on the application of machine learning and multispectral features in these fields.

However, in general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming features to have similar scales, often using techniques like standardization or feature scaling
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of the most relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data transformation: transforming data types, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables

These preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
