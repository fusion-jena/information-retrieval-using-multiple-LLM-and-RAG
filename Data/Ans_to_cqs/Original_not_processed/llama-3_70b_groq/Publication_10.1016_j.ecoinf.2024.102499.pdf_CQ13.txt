Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Learning rate: 0.008
* Learning rate decay: cosine learning rate decay
* Batch size: 16 images per iteration
* Number of iterations: 200,000

These hyperparameters are mentioned in the provided context. However, the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned.
