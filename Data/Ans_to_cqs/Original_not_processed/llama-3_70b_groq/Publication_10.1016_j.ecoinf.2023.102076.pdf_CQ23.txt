Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset or cross-validation. However, it does mention stratification of training data for classification tasks 2 and 3, which influenced the performance of the classifiers in identifying relevant texts in testing data. The recall of relevant texts within stratified testing sets was higher for classifiers trained on stratified data compared to those trained on non-stratified data. This suggests that stratified splitting was used to some extent, but it is not clear if this was done for all classification tasks or only for tasks 2 and 3. Additionally, there is no mention of other measures such as diverse dataset or cross-validation.
