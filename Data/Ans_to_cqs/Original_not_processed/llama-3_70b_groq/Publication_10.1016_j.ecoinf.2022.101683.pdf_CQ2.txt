Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a table of metrics and results from a machine learning model evaluation, but it does not mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context does not provide any information about the type of data being used, such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, I cannot determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
