Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on neural networks, machine learning, and remote sensing applications, with references to papers and studies on topics like water quality estimation, wind erosion rates, and ocean color products. 

However, it does mention Landsat 8 data, Sentinel-2 images, and UAV images, which are likely used as datasets in the context of remote sensing and environmental applications. But it does not provide information on the specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are typically used for image classification tasks.
