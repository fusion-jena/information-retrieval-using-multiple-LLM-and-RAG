Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is designed to classify water quality into contaminated and non-contaminated classes. This is evident from the text, which states that the model enables "precise water contamination classification" and that the data is segregated into "contaminated and non-contaminated classes". The model uses IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration, to calculate a water contamination index, which facilitates the accurate segregation of data into these two classes.
