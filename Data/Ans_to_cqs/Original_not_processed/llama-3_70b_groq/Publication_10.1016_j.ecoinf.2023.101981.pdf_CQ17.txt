Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the detection of ungulate vocalizations using machine learning algorithms and mentions the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
