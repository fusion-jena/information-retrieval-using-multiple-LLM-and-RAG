Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the methodology used to collect field measurements, train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, and validate the model using independent data from the Conklin field site. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
