Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the AdamW optimizer, which decouples the weight decay. This suggests that weight decay is used as a regularization method. Additionally, the context does not mention other common regularization methods such as dropout or early stopping. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method that can be inferred is weight decay.
