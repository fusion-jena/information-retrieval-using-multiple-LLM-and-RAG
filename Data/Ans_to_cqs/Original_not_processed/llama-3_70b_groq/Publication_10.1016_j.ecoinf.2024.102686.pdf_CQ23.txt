Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses the importance of synthesizing various types of data to study regional differentiation and the use of machine learning, specifically SVM (Support Vector Machine), for large-scale partitioning. However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

The context only mentions the limitations of SVM, such as its training efficiency for large sample datasets and the non-uniform boundaries delineated by SVM with administrative boundaries. It also discusses future topics to be addressed, including optimizing the training algorithm and incorporating remote connectivity into HAâ€“NE coupled zoning. However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
