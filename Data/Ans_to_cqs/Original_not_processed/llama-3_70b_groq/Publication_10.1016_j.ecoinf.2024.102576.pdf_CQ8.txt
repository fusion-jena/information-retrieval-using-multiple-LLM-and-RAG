Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning models for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information, but it does not provide any details about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
