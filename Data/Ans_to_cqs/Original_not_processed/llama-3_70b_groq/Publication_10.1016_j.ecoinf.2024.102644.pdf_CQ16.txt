Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing the results of a species distribution model, specifically the MaxEnt model, and its performance in predicting species presence locations. It mentions the omission rate of the training presence locations and the use of a threshold to determine suitable/unsuitable locations, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
