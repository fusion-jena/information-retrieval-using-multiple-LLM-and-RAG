Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, as well as the use of synthetic data and data augmentation. It does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions the use of "real MS point clouds" and "synthetic data" as inputs to the model. It is likely that some form of preprocessing was necessary to prepare these inputs for training, but the specific steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
