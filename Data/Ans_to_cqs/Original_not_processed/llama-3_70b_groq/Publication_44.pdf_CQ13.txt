Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context only discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of Faster R-CNN, Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), and connected component analysis, but does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
