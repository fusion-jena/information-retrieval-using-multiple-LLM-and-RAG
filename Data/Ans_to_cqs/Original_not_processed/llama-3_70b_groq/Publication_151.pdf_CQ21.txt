Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, evaluation on simulated data sets, and the placement of query sequences onto a reference tree using the trained CNN model.

However, it can be inferred that after the model training, the model is used to map a given query sequence to a vector of distances. For data sets with missing data (gaps), two sets of distances are computed using the models with and without gap reconstruction. The final distances are then set to the weighted sum of the distances. These distances are used for distance-based placement of the query sequence onto the reference tree using dynamic programming.

There is no mention of Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps in the provided context.
