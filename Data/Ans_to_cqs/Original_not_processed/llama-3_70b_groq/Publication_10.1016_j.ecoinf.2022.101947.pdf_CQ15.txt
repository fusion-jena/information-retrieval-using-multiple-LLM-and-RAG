Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the collection and processing of trail data from Amur tigers, the formation of sub-trails, and the validation of an algorithm for sex classification. It discusses the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets, as well as holdback trials to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
