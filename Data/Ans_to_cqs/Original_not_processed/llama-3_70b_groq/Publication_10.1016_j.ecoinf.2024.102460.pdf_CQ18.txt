Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses various models such as LSTM, FMOP, and MOP, and their applications in land use allocation and time series data prediction. It also mentions the use of random forest (RFC) to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
