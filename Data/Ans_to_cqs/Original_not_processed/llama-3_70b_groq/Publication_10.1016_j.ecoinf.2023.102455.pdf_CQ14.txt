Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian Optimization. This is stated in the text as "The Bayesian Optimization program was used in this study to optimize hyperparameters related to ML algorithms." This method is compared to other methods such as grid search and random search, implying that Bayesian Optimization is the chosen method for hyperparameter optimization in this study.
