Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the description of the input layer having 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data, it can be inferred that the data format is likely a numerical or spectral data format, possibly in a CSV or similar format. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
