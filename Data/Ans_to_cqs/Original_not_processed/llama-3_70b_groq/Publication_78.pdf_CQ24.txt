Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on various applications of deep learning and machine learning techniques, including image classification, coral reef classification, and chronic disease prediction.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the random selection of cluster centers in Algorithm 1, which suggests that randomness is being used in some capacity. Additionally, the context cites various papers that employ deep learning techniques, which often involve random initialization of weights and biases.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting
* Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random initializations
* Using ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random initializations

However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
