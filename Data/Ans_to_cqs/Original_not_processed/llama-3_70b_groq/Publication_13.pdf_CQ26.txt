Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) as a technique used to improve the performance of a model on a target dataset that is different from the source dataset.

Domain adversarial training is a technique that can help address data bias by learning domain-invariant features that are applicable to both the source and target datasets. This can help improve the model's performance on the target dataset, even if it is biased or has a different distribution than the source dataset.

The context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be used to address data bias is domain adversarial training.
