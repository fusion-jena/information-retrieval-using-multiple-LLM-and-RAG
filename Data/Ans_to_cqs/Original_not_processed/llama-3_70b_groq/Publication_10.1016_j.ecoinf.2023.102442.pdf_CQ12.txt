Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a multispectral convolutional neural network (CNN). This is mentioned in the paper by Gallwey et al. (2020), which states that a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network is used for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana.
