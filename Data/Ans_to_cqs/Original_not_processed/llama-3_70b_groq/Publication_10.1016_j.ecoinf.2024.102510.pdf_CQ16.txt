Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and performance comparison of different models. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs.

However, it is common in machine learning to use various criteria to determine when training is complete, such as:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, training can be stopped.
* Convergence: When the model's performance on the training or validation set converges, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a specified number of epochs, regardless of the model's performance.
* Early stopping: Training can be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific criteria used in this particular context.
