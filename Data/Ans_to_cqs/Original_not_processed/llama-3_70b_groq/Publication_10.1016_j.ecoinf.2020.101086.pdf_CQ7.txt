Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the challenges of dealing with biased and limited data in this field. It mentions various SDM approaches, such as generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines, but does not provide information on how to split data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
