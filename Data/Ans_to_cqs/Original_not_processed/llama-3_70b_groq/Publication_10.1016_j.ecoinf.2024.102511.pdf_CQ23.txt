Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics related to bioacoustics, deep learning, and species classification, but it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, it can be inferred that the authors acknowledge the importance of having a diverse dataset and representative samples. For instance, the context mentions the ideal scenario where "all species would be included in a classification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity" and "all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to better represent the variability found in the area." This suggests that the authors recognize the need for a diverse and representative dataset, but it does not provide specific details on how this was achieved.

Additionally, the context mentions the importance of "confident 'ground truth' classifications" and the need for a "high level of confidence for inclusion" in the training data, particularly for species with small sample sizes. This implies that the authors may have taken steps to ensure the quality and reliability of the training data, but again, it does not provide specific information on measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while the context provides some insights into the importance of dataset diversity and quality, it does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
