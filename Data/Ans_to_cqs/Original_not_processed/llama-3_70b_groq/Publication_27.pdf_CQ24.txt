Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of Unicode characters, possibly representing mathematical equations or code snippets, but it does not provide a clear answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Randomness is often introduced in deep learning through random initialization of model weights, random shuffling of training data, and random dropout of neurons during training. To handle this randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Fixing the random seed**: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of results, as the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the code is run.
2. **Using reproducible random number generators**: Some deep learning frameworks, like TensorFlow, provide reproducible random number generators that can be used to ensure consistent results.
3. **Averaging multiple runs**: Running the model multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
4. **Using techniques like Bayesian neural networks**: These techniques inherently model uncertainty and can provide a way to quantify the effect of randomness on the model's predictions.

Please note that these strategies are general and may not be directly applicable to the specific context provided. If you have any further information or clarification regarding the context, I may be able to provide a more specific answer.
