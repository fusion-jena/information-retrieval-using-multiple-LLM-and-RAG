Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only provides information about the performance metrics of various CPU/microprocessor architectures, including AMD Ryzen, Intel Core i7, Cortex-A57, Nvidia Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, and MediaTek Pumpkin i500. There is no mention of GPUs or TPUs being used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
