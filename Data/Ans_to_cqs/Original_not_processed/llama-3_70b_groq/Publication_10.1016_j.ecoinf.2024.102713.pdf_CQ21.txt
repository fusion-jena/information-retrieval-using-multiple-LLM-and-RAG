Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to describe a system called CASE, which is used for data collection and analysis in the context of monitoring and tracking H. halys captures. It discusses the relational schema of the database, data sources, and analytical fruition, but does not provide any information about machine learning model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
