Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to a research study that involves integrating various datasets from different sources, including the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, National Meteorological Science Data Center, Harmonized World Soil Database, and others. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the pipeline's data is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
