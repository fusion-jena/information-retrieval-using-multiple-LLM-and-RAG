Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). Additionally, normalized counterparts of these metrics, such as MAE%, RMSE%, and MBE%, are also used. These metrics are used to measure the average deviation between model predictions and reference data, with RMSE giving higher penalty to large deviations. The MBE metric serves to identify systematic biases in the predictions.
