Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models for estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) and discusses various models, including AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression. It also mentions the importance of machine learning techniques in revealing complicated nonlinear patterns and solving data dimensional problems. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
