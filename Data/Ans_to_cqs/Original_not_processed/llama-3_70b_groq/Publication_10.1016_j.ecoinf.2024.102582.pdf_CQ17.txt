Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning pipeline or regularization methods to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be related to mangrove forest research, remote sensing, and land use/cover change analysis using machine learning approaches such as random forest algorithm. However, it does not provide information about the specific deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
