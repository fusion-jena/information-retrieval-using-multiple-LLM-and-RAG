Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the data used for model training and selection were randomly partitioned into different sets: At (25% of the data) for training candidate models, Av (50% of the data) for validating candidate models, and Bt (75% of the data) for training the selected candidate model. This random partitioning could be seen as a form of data splitting, which can help improve the model's generalizability. Additionally, the model selection procedure involved training multiple models with different architectures and selecting the best-performing one, which could also contribute to the model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
