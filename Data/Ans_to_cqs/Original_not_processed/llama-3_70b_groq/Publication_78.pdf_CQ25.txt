Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, the model is used to classify coral images as either bleached coral or healthy coral. The model takes in image patches as input, extracts features using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNN models, and then uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the class label. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa.
