The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various sources such as GitHub (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and DOIs for published papers (e.g., https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00083), but it does not provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
