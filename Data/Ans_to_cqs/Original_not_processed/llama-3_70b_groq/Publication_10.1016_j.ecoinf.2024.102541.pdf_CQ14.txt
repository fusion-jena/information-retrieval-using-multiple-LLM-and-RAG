Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the modifications made to the YOLOv5 model to improve its performance and efficiency, such as replacing the Focus layer with a Stem Block, using Mobile Bottleneck Blocks, and integrating depth-wise separable convolutions. It also explains the use of a novel loss function, Focal-EIoU, and provides equations for calculating the intersection over union (IoU) and the EIoU loss. However, it does not mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
