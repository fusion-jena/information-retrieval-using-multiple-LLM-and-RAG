Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies and discusses the architecture of the U-net model, data augmentation techniques, and the experimental setup. It does not provide information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
