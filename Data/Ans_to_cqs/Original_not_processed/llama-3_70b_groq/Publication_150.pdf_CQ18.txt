Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the model training process, including the use of pre-trained models, data augmentation, and class weighting to address class imbalance. It also mentions the evaluation metrics used, such as top-1 to top-5 accuracy and macro recall, but it does not specify how the model performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
