Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the application of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify and count animal species, and the challenges and opportunities of using RFID technology to collect large amounts of automatically labelled data. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
