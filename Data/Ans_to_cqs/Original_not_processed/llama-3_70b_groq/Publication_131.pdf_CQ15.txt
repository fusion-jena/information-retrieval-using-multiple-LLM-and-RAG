Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the architecture of the CNN, the number of filters, kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. It also provides information about the training and testing data, as well as the accuracy results. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
