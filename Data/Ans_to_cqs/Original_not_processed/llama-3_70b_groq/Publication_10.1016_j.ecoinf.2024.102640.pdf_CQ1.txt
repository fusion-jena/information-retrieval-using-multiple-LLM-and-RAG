Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline for Green View Index (GVI) learning utilizes a dataset specially designed for GVI extraction, called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset). The context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data for this dataset. However, it does mention other datasets, such as COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K, which are used for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios. 

It can be inferred that the UGE-D dataset might have been constructed using similar methods, but the exact approach is not specified. The context also mentions airborne lidar data, which could be a potential method for collecting raw data, but it is not explicitly linked to the UGE-D dataset. 

In the absence of explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this pipeline.
