Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms in water quality management, environmental pollution, and phytoplankton dynamics. It discusses the use of maximal information coefficient (MIC) analysis to detect nonlinear associations between variables and the integration of sensor data with machine learning modeling. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
