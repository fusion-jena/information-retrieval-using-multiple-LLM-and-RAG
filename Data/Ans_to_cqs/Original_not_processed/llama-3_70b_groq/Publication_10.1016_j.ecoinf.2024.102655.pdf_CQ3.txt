Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to machine learning models for predicting river water quality, and it discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select representative training data subsets. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
