Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for unsupervised learning and clustering analysis, as well as hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) for spatial clustering of ecosystem services. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
