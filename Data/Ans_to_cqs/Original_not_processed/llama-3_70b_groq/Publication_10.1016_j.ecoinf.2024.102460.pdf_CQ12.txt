Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is mentioned in the context as "a deep learning time series forecasting model (LSTM)" and also in the description of the LSTM model in section 4.3.3.
