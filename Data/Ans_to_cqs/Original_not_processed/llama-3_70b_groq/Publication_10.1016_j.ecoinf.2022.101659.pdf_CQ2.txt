The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The text appears to be discussing valve gaping in shellfish and its relationship with environmental variables, with data analysis conducted in R 4.0.5. The data mentioned is in the form of gaping data, expressed as a proportion of aperture, and recorded at 1 Hz, which is then averaged over 5 min or 1 min intervals. There is no mention of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
