Answer:::
Answer: The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. The specific techniques used are not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that data augmentation was applied to enhance model robustness due to the small sample size. It does not mention flipping, rotating, or scaling, but rather a general deformation of the input images.
