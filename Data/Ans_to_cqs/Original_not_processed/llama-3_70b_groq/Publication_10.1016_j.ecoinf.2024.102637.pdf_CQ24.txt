Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on bird sound classification, image recognition, and radiomics analysis using deep learning techniques. It discusses the importance of combining bird voice recognition and deep learning for conservation, proposes a lightweight SIAlex model, and explains the role of batch normalization in accelerating network convergence and preventing overfitting.

However, it is worth noting that batch normalization, which is mentioned in the context, can help reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Batch normalization normalizes the input data for each layer, which can help stabilize the training process and reduce the effect of random initialization of weights and biases.

In general, other strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value, using reproducible random number generators, and employing techniques such as dropout and data augmentation to increase robustness to random variations. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
