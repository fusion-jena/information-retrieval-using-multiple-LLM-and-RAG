Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention that the active learning process biases labeled data to the model, and that the authors used a random selection approach that was stratified across the model's predictions (logits) to overcome class imbalance within the evaluation data. This approach substantially reduced class imbalance within the evaluation data and allowed for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics. 

It can be inferred that stratified sampling was used to address data bias, but it is not clear if other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used. Further research is needed to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data.
