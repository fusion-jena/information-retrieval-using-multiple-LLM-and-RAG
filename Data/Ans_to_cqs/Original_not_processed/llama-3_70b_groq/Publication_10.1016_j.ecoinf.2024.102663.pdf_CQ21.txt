Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different machine learning models, such as Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge, and their training times. It also discusses the results of YOLOv8 after applying different preprocessing methods. However, it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
