Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the validation set is used to validate the hyper-parameters and assess the classification accuracy of the target model. This implies that the model's performance is being monitored during training using the validation set, but the specific strategy or metrics used to do so are not specified.

It's worth noting that the context discusses the importance of avoiding overfitting, which suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored to prevent overfitting. However, the exact strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance is not provided.
