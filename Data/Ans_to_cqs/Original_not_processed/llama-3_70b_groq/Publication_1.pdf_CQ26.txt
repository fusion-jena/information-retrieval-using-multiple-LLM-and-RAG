Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity monitoring and the use of machine learning techniques to detect and classify events of interest, but it does not provide specific information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
