Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, which is a dataset used in the paper. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species using six different commercial cameras. This suggests that the raw data is collected through camera images, but the exact method of data collection is not specified. It does not mention surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods of data collection.
