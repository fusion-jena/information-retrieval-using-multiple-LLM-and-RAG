Answer: 

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, particularly when dealing with imperfect training data. It discusses the advantages of using a multiple-instance learning algorithm, MTMI-SMF, which can handle variability or imprecision in the training dataset. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
