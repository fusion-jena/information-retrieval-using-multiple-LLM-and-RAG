Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on land use demand prediction using different models such as Markov chain, LSTM, and BP neural network, and optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming (MOP) model. It does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
