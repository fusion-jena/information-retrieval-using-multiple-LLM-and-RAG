Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods for classification, including "human in the loop" classification, and the importance of considering uncertainty in the analysis. However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

The context focuses on the application of machine learning methods to ecological informatics, specifically in the context of analyzing historical aerial imagery for ecological restoration goals. It discusses the limitations of machine learning methods, the importance of incorporating human expertise, and the need to quantify and propagate uncertainty in the analysis. But it does not provide information on the specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
