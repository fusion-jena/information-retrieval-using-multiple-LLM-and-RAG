Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models, sampling bias, and the limitations of presence sites, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
