Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the preprocessing steps involved for the GF-6 remote sensing data, which includes radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. These steps are likely specific to the remote sensing data and may not be directly applicable to preprocessing steps for a deep learning model.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature selection, and data augmentation, among others. However, the specific preprocessing steps required would depend on the type of data, model, and problem being addressed.

In this case, since the context does not provide information on deep learning model preprocessing, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
