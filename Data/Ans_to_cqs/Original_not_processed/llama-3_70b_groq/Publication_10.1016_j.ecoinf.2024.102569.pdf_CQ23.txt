Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the selection of tuning parameters for a model using the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) and discusses issues related to heterogeneous observations in crowdsourcing data analysis. It does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
