Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the performance of the trained model is evaluated by validating it against the test images and computing metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other relevant measures. It also states that the parameters and structure of the model are adjusted based on the evaluation results to improve the detection performance, and the training and evaluation process is iterated until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved.

This suggests that the training process is continued until the model's performance on the test images reaches a satisfactory level, but the specific criteria for determining when this level is reached are not specified. It is possible that the criteria may include a plateau in the validation loss, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
