Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context only discusses the architecture and training of the models, including the decoder, MLP, and Autoencoder, as well as the hyperparameters and regularization techniques used. It does not provide any information about the code repository or where the code can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
