Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in this study involve soil sampling and remote sensing image data. Specifically, a Phoenix receiver was used to determine sample locations, and three five-cm-diameter cores of 15-cm length were taken at each location, blended to obtain a representative sample of the soil at that site. A total of 300 representative soil samples were collected. Additionally, remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, as well as data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), were used in this study. The remote sensing image data were pre-processed, including geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking and cropping, to obtain topographic variables such as slope, aspect, and drainage.
