Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for species distribution modeling and mentions the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations, which are the size and number of kernels. It does not provide information about other hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
