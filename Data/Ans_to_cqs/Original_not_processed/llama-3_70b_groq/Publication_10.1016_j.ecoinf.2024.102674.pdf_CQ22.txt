Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or the evaluation metrics typically associated with them, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Instead, the context discusses the evaluation of temperature prediction models using metrics such as percent bias (pbias), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the performance of the models in terms of their ability to accurately predict temperatures. 

The context also mentions the use of KGE scores, but it does not provide a clear definition of what KGE scores are or how they are calculated. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as deep learning models are not mentioned.
