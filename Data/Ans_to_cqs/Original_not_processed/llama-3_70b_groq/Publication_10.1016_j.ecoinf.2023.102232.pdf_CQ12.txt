Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text describes a physiologically based model for Drosophila suzukii, which is a type of mathematical model, not a deep learning model. The model is described using a system of differential equations, and the text mentions the use of a genetic algorithm for optimization, but it does not mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
