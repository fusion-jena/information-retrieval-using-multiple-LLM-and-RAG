Answer:::

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the training modes (zero-start and incremental), the evaluation metrics, and the termination condition of the model, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
