Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation. Specifically, it states that "During the cross-validation process, there were no discrepancies among the three metrics used." This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and to avoid overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested on unseen data, which further supports the idea that cross-validation was used to ensure the model's generalizability. However, it does not provide further details on the specific cross-validation technique used (e.g., k-fold, leave-one-out).
