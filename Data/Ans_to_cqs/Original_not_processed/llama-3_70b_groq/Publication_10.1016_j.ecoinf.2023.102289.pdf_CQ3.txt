Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on LaDeco, a tool for landscape element detection, and its components, such as the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model, and semantic segmentation. It also discusses the concept of semantic segmentation, its components, and its applications. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, are typically used in object detection and segmentation tasks. While the context mentions object detection and segmentation, it does not specify the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
