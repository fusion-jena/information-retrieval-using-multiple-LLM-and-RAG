Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the Machine Learning Models (MLMs). These metrics include AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi. Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of Î” AUC to evaluate model complexity and the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether a significant difference in prediction accuracy exists among the classifiers.

Although the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices, it does imply that the models' predictive performance is evaluated using various metrics. However, it does not provide information on whether these metrics are calculated as part of postprocessing steps or during the model training process.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query about the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
