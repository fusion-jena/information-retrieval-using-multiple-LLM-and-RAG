Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context focuses on hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. It discusses the tuning of hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_features, min_samples_split, max_depth, and criterion for the RF algorithm. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
