Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions a deep learning model in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), but it does not provide information about the framework used to build the model. It only mentions that the model is combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning model.
