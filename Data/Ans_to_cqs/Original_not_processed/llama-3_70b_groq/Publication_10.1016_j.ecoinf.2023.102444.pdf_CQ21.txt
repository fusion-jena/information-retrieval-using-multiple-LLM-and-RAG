Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Embedding the testing data into the model for projection in the latent space.
2. Calculating the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb).
3. Calculating Pss, the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss.
4. Calculating S = (1- Pss) for the distances between the background and species.
5. Assessing the model as a binary classifier by calculating metrics such as:
   - Area under the curve (AUC)
   - Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
   - Kappa index (K)
   - Point-biserial correlation (COR) index
6. Calculating the mutual information coefficient (MIC) to evaluate the relative importance of the bioclimatic variables as related to latent distance.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context.
