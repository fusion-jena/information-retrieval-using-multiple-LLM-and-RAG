Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data preprocessing, neural network architecture, and generating prediction records. It discusses segmenting audio data into 8-second clips, downsampling, and converting segments into log-mel spectrograms, but it does not mention techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
