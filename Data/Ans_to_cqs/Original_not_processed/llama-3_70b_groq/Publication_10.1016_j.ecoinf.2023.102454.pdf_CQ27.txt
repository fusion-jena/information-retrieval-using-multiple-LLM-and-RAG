Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing ecological informatics, carbon emissions, and city-level CO2 emission accounts, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
