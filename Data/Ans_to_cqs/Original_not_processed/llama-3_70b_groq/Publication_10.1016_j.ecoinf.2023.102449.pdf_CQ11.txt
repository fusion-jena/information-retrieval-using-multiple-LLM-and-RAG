Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing a novel approach to ecoacoustic representation learning using deep neural networks, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The references cited in the context are arXiv links, which are preprint servers for research papers, but they do not provide access to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
