Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, bioclimatic variables, and dimensionality reduction methods, particularly UMAP. It mentions a convolutional neural network being used to model species distribution at a fine resolution, but it does not specify the dataset used for this task. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
