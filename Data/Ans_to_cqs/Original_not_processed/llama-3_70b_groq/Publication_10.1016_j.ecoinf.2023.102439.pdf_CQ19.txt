Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the use of artificial neural networks, specifically the NARX model, and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm. However, it does not provide information about the framework used to implement these models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
