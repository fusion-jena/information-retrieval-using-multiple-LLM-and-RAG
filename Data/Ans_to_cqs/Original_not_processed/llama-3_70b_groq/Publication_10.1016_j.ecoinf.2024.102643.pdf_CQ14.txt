Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of different algorithms, such as GBM, Maxent, and GLM, and the construction of an ensemble model by weight averaging the predictions from these algorithms. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
