Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of random forest models, which are a type of machine learning model, but not deep learning model. Random forest models are an ensemble learning method that operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on subsets of the input features. 

The only mention of deep learning is in the first reference, which is about a "Deep learning based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent." However, this is not related to the pipeline mentioned in the query. Therefore, I don't know what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
