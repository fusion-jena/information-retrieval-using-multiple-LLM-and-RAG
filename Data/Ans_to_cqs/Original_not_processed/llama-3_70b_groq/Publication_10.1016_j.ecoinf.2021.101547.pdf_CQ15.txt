Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the mini-batch size, its impact on the learning process, and the limitations imposed by the available GPU memory. It also discusses the challenges of using deep learning, the importance of reviewing published studies, and the need for trial and error in setting training options. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
