Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction from digitized herbarium sheets. It discusses the use of transfer learning, pre-trained weights, and fine-tuning for training the model, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
