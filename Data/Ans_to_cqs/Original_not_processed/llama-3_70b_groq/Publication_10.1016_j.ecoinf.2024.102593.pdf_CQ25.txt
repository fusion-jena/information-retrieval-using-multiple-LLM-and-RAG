Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions training DNN models with the NIPS4Bplus dataset and BirdCLEF 2020 dataset, which suggests that the models are being used for classification tasks, such as classifying bird species based on their sounds. The text also mentions using embeddings to assist in model selection for classifying unseen data, which further supports the idea that the models are being used for classification.
