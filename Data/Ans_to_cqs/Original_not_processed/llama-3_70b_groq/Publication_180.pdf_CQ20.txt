Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the researchers adapted and configured TensorFlow for application and use in their project via Python, and adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. There is no mention of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
