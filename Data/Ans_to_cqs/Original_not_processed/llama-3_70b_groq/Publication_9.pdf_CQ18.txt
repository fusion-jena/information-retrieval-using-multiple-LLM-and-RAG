Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does emphasize the importance of iterative model training and refinement to achieve suitable performance for specific use cases. It suggests that users should anticipate training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved. This implies that model performance is being monitored and evaluated during the training process, but the exact strategy or metrics used for this purpose are not specified.
