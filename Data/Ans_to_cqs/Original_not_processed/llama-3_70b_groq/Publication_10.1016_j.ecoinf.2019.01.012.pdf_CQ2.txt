Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context mentions the classification of digital images, and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis. The training data consists of 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles of images, and the model is applied to whole repeat photographs that are split into tiles of the same size. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
