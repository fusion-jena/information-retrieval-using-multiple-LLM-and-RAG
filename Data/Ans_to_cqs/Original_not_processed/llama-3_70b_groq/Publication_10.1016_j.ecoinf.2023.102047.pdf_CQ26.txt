Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique to avoid overfitting and increase the size and variability of the dataset. The context lists various data augmentation techniques applied to both models, including random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, gaussian noise, and random erasing. These techniques can help reduce data bias by artificially increasing the size of the dataset and making it more diverse. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of techniques to address data bias during preprocessing.
