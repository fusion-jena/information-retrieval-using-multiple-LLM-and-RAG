Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various research papers and articles, but it does not provide specific information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in a particular study or model.

If you are looking for information on data splitting criteria, I would recommend consulting machine learning or deep learning textbooks, online resources, or research papers that specifically focus on data preprocessing and model evaluation.
