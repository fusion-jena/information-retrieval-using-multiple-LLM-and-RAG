Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a snippet from a research paper or article, but it does not contain any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text seems to be discussing clustering analysis and species classification, but it does not provide any links to external repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link as requested.
