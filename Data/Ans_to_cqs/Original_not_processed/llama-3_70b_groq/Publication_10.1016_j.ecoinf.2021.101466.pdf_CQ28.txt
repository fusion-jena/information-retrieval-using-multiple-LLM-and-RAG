Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses various deep learning models such as EfficientNet, YOLOv4, and CNNs, and their applications in image classification and object detection tasks. It also mentions data augmentation methods and performance improvements, but it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
