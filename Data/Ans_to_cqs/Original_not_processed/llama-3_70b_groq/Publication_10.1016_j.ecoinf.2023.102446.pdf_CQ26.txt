Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipeline, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be related to a study involving flux tower data and causal networks, but it does not provide any information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
