Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically YOLOv5, for detecting and counting alates on sorghum leaves. It discusses the dataset splitting ratio, model training, and performance evaluation, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
