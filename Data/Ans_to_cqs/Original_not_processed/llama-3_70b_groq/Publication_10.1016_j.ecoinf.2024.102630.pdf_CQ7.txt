Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on NDVI data, its calculation, and classification analysis using the Jenks natural breaks optimization method. It also mentions various research studies related to NDVI and remote sensing but does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
