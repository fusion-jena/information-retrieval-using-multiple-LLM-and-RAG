Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that Xu et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN-based) segmentation model. However, it is not explicitly stated that this model is part of the pipeline in question. Therefore, I cannot conclude that a CNN is used in the pipeline.

It is also important to note that there is no mention of RNN or Transformer models in the provided context. Therefore, it is unlikely that these types of models are used in the pipeline.

In conclusion, I do not have enough information to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
