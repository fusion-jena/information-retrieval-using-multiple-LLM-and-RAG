Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions "footprint images" and "camera-trap images" being collected and used for sex classification analysis. Additionally, it is mentioned that a digital camera or smartphone can be used to capture data at a minimum recommended resolution of 1600 Ã— 1200 pixels, and that images can be stored on an external or cloud-based drive. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned either, but it is possible that it might be used for storing or processing the image metadata or classification results, although this is not explicitly stated.
