Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, for object recognition and categorization, as well as forest type classification using remote sensing data. While it cites various references and includes tables and figures, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
