Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the results of a model, including log likelihood, R-squared values, and classification tables, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
