Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to a research study that utilizes remote sensing data, specifically the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, to analyze vegetation trends. The study preprocesses the data, extracts features, and applies a classification scheme to the data, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
