Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental results and the improvement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating CAM into the residual network. It discusses the correlation between image size and classification performance but does not provide information on postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, or others, as this information is not provided in the given context.
