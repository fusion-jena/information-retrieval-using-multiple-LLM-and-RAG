Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, preprocessing steps, normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The text appears to be discussing a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect data on marine species sightings during recreational SCUBA dives. The focus is on data collection, validation, and usability, rather than machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
