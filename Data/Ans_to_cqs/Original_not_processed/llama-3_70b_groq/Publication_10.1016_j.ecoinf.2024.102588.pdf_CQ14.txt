Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameter settings used for the Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models. For example, it states that the hyperparameters of the RF were set to the number of estimators at 100 and the random state at 0, and the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model were set to specific values for the subsample ratio, learning rate, maximum depth of a tree, alpha, and number of estimators. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
