Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, with references to MODIS, Landsat, and other datasets related to vegetation phenology, plant species identification, and environmental monitoring.

However, some papers do mention the use of deep learning techniques, such as LeafNet for automatic plant species identification, and the use of hybrid deep learning for plant species identification. But the specific datasets used in these pipelines are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
