Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model's hyperparameters, data augmentation, and training process, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
