Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a ResNet-50, which is a type of residual neural network that is commonly used for image classification and feature extraction tasks. The context also mentions a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) with a cascade structure, which is used for object detection and classification. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
