Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the use of validation sets to evaluate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters, as well as the use of k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. However, it does not specify a particular criterion, such as a validation loss plateau, to determine when training is complete.

It can be inferred that the training process involves iterative training and validation on different sets, with the goal of achieving the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test datasets. The context also mentions retraining the model until it yields the highest accuracy possible, but it does not provide a specific stopping criterion.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
