Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on data splitting, model selection, and performance evaluation. It discusses the splitting of data into training and testing sets, the use of different machine learning algorithms, and the evaluation of their performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when the training process is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
