Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context, specifically the ERNIE model, is for emotional analysis and text classification. The ERNIE model is used to learn prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data, which enhances its semantic representation. It has achieved significant results in previous studies and has performed better than other models, such as the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI. Additionally, the ERNIE model earned first place for a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020.
