Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is available. It only mentions that the data used in the study, the code used in the analysis, and the trained machine learning model were published, but it does not provide the exact location or repository where they can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is available.
