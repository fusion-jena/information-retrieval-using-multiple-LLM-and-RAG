Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model is used for classification purposes. Specifically, the context mentions "multi-temporal crop classification" in the paper by Zhong, Hu, and Zhou (2019), which suggests that the deep learning model is used to classify different crop types. Additionally, the context also mentions "identification of land types and tree species" in the paper by Zhang et al. (2023), which further supports the idea that the deep learning model is used for classification. 

However, it is important to note that the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and the purpose of the deep learning model may vary depending on the specific application or study. Therefore, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer.
