Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the best model is selected by comparing the performance scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters, but it does not specify what those performance scores are based on. 

It is common in deep learning to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. to evaluate the performance of a model. However, without explicit mention in the context, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used in this case.
