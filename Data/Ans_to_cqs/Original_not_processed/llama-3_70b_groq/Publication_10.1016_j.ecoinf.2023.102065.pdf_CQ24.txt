Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some techniques used to handle randomness and variability in the data and model training process.

For instance, the context mentions random sampling of ROIs (Regions of Interest) per species to form a held-out test set, validation set, and training set. This random sampling helps to reduce bias and ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on diverse and representative data.

Additionally, the context mentions padding ROIs that are less than 2 seconds in duration to a total of 2 seconds, which helps to handle variability in the length of the audio recordings.

While these techniques help to handle randomness and variability in the data, they do not specifically address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
