Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "accuracy" and "loss" as measures of the model's performance. 

Accuracy is mentioned as a metric used to compute the performance of the model on the validation dataset. The context also mentions that the model was trained until a satisfactory performance was achieved, suggesting that accuracy was used as a stopping criterion.

Loss is mentioned as a measure of the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The context states that if there was no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs, the training was stopped.

While precision and recall are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy and loss are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this specific context.
