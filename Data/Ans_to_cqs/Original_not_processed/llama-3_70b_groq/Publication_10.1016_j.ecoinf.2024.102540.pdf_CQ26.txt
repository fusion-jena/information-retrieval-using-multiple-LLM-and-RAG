Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the splitting ratio of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, but it does not provide information on how data bias is handled.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of an 80:10:10 splitting ratio, which is a common practice in machine learning. This ratio is often used to ensure that the training set is large enough to train the model effectively, while the validation and testing sets are used to evaluate the model's performance.

It is possible that the authors may have used techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
