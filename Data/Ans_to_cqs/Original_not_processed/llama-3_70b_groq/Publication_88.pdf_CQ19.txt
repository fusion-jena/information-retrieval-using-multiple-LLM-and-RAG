Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the models (EF and SN). It only describes the architecture of the models, including the number of layers, filter sizes, and output sizes, but does not specify the framework used to implement them. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
