Answer: The context does not mention training a deep learning model, nor does it mention the use of GPUs or TPUs. The computing tools used are two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with four processors Intel Xeon Gold 5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads, and 512 GB of RAM. The nodes work in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2.
