Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, and InceptionV3, which are pre-trained networks, but it does not specify the datasets used to train these models. 

However, it can be inferred that the models are used for image classification tasks, particularly for bivalve shell image analysis. The context also mentions that the goal of the study is to develop a deep network that can sensitively and specifically identify the sampling location of the provided bivalve shell image. 

Therefore, it can be assumed that the dataset used in this study consists of bivalve shell images, but the specific name of the dataset is not provided.
