Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, specifically LightGBM, and their applications in predicting forest canopy cover from satellite images. It discusses the advantages of LightGBM, its unique features, and its comparison with other machine learning models. Additionally, it provides information on the hyperparameters used in various machine learning models. However, it does not provide any information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
