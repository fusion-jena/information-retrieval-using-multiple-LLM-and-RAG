Answer: 

The context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for species distribution modeling. The performance of these models is evaluated using the following metrics: 

1. Area Under the Curve (AUC)
2. Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)
3. True Skill Statistics (TSS)
4. Cohen's KAPPA
5. Point-biserial correlation (COR)

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and performance of the final models. However, it does not mention deep learning models or metrics such as precision and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
