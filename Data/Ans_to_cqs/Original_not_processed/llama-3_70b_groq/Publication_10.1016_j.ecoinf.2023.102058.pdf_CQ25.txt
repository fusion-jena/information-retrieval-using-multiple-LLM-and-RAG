Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the keywords and references mentioned, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for estimating or predicting water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll a concentration, using hyperspectral data. 

In the context of water quality monitoring, the deep learning model is likely used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous values of water quality parameters from hyperspectral data. This is supported by the reference to Maier et al. (2021), which mentions estimating chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies using deep learning with WASI simulation data.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
