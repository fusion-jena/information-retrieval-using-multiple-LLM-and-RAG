Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some information about the training and testing process. 

The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%). The training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, with all five algorithms using the same training and testing picture subsets in each of these (pseudo-)replicate runs. This suggests that some form of cross-validation was used, but it is not clear if it was stratified or not. 

There is no mention of the diversity of the dataset or any other measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that diverse datasets or stratified splitting were used.
