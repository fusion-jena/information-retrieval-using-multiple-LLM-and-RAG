Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the parameter settings used in the experiments, including the use of pre-trained weights from the 'imagenet' dataset, 10 epochs of training, a batch size of 32, and one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. However, it does not provide information about the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
