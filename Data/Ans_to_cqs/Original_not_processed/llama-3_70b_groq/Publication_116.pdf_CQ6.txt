Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data augmentation is used, as mentioned in the text: "Simple crop and resize data augmentation is used with the default settings of Caffe." This suggests that the input images are resized and randomly cropped to increase the diversity of the training data.

Additionally, the use of batch normalization is mentioned throughout the context, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. This helps to reduce the internal covariate shift and improve the stability of the training process.

No other preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether these steps are involved in the preprocessing pipeline.
