Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention CutMix, which is a regularization strategy to train strong classifiers with localizable features. It also mentions Mixup, which is a method that goes beyond empirical risk minimization. These methods can be used to prevent overfitting, but the context does not provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods.

Additionally, the context discusses various deep learning models, such as Transformers, ViT, and CNNs, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in these models. It does mention hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay, which can affect the model's ability to overfit, but it does not explicitly discuss regularization methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
