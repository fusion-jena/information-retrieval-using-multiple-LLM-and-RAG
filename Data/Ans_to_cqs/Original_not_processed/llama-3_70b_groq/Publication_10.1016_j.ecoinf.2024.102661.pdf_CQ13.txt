Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context focuses on the TPEBO algorithm and its application to hyperparameter optimization for LSTM neural networks. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters in shaping the architecture of deep learning models and the learning process, but it does not specify the particular hyperparameters used.

However, it does mention that the number of hidden layers is a crucial hyperparameter that helps the model capture complex patterns, and its range is set between 1 and 3 based on initial tests. This suggests that the number of hidden layers is one of the hyperparameters being optimized, but it does not provide information on other hyperparameters like learning rate and optimizer.

Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer, based on the provided context.
