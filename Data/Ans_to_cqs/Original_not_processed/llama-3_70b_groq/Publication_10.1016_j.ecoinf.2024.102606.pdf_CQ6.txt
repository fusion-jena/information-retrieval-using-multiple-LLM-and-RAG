Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that are applied to the training data. These techniques include Random crop, Mosaic, and Color distortions such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. These augmentations are used to artificially increase the size of the dataset, reduce the risk of overfitting, and make the model more reliable on a wider range of input data. 

It is likely that some preprocessing steps were performed before training the model, but the context does not provide specific information about them.
