Answer: 

The provided context only mentions a few hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions that the model is trained with a batch size of 1, an input image resolution of 1536 Ã— 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10^-5. Additionally, it mentions that only horizontal flipping is used for data augmentation. However, it does not provide information about the optimizer used in the model. Therefore, we can only partially answer the query.
