Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the baseline model, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the integration of contextual information into the model. It also provides a brief overview of deep learning and its applications.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of spectrogram inputs, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been applied to the audio data before feeding it into the model. Additionally, the context does not provide any information about normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
