Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison of different pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on leaf species classification, their accuracy on raw and pre-processed images, and the analysis of their robustness by swapping testing sets. It does not discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
