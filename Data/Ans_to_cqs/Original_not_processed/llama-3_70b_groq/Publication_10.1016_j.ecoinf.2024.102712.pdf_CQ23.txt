Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the model is leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. In this approach, one observation at a time is extracted from the dataset, and the model parameters are estimated using the remaining (n-1) observations. The model is then applied to the extracted observation. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance and ensures that the model is not overfitting to the training data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
