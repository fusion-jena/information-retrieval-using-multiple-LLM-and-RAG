Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on temperature prediction using different machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosting Models (GBMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It discusses the evaluation metrics used, such as pbias, MAE, and RMSE, and the parameters used for model calibration, but it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
