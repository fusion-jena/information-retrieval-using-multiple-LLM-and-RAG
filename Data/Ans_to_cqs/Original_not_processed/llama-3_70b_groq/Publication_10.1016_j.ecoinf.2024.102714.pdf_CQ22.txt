Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It discusses the accuracy assessment of the classification model, but it does not provide specific metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. 

However, it does mention "model accuracies" and "actual accuracies" in different sections, indicating that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. But it does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics used for evaluation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used, but I don't know about other metrics such as precision, recall, etc.
