Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics related to deep learning, natural language processing, and sensor networks, but it does not provide information about a data repository. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not seem to be related to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
