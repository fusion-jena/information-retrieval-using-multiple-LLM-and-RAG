Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, and grid search for selecting the optimal hyperparameters. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
