Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation is involved, as the performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated using metrics such as adj_R2, RMSE, MAE, and KGE (Fig. 4). 

Additionally, the context suggests that the relative importance of the predictor variables is calculated and visualized (Fig. 6), which can be considered as a form of feature importance or saliency analysis. 

However, there is no mention of confusion matrices, saliency maps, or other postprocessing steps. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps are involved in the model evaluation process.
