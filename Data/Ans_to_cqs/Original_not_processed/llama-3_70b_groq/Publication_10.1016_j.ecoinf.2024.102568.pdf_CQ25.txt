Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the LSTM model, is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression tasks, such as predicting air quality concentrations. The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, which is commonly used for regression problems. Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MRE, which are also commonly used for regression tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to make predictions or forecasts of continuous values, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
