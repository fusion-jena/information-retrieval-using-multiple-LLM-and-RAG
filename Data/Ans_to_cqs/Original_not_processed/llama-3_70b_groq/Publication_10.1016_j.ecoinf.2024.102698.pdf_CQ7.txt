Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the generation of synthetic connectivity data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, the evaluation of synthetic data quality using utility metrics, and the challenges of ensuring that synthetic data accurately represents original data. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation in a deep learning model.
