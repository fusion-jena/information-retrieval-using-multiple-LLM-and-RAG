Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the selection of the VGG16 CNN architecture, the performance of the model on the ImageNet dataset, and the training and testing of the model on a dataset of 12,000 frames extracted from 1500 videos. 

There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used to label and prepare data for training machine learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
