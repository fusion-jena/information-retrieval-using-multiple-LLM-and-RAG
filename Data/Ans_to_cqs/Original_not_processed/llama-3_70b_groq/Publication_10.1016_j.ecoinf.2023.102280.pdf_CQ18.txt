Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the challenges of generating training data for fine-tuning, the importance of data requirements for monitoring applications, and the use of data augmentation techniques. It also mentions that both methods (WPD and spectral subtraction) are manually tuned to maximize the evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
