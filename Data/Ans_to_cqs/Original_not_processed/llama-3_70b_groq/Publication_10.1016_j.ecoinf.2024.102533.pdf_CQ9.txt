Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a clustering method for determining freshness classes of species based on six body parts parameters, but it does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
