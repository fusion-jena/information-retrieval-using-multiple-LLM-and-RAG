Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of six popular deep learning models, including InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and GoogleNet, all of which are variants of CNNs. These models are commonly used in computer vision tasks and have demonstrated competitive performance in various applications.
