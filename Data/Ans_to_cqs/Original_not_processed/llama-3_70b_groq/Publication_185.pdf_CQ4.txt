Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. In fact, it is explicitly stated that "The experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation." This implies that no data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, were used in the experiments.
