Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the authors applied a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) cross-validation technique, which ensured that the same subject did not appear in both the training and testing sets at the same time. This helped to eliminate the influence of individual subjects on the model's performance.

Additionally, the authors applied aggressive data augmentation to the training sets, which included random horizontal flipping of images. This helped to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Furthermore, the authors used a large dataset of 8002 images, which was expanded to 40,010 images by applying data augmentation. This large dataset helped to improve the model's generalizability by exposing it to a wide range of images.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether the dataset was stratified or not. The authors do not mention any specific measures taken to ensure stratification.

Overall, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, including cross-validation, data augmentation, and using a large dataset. However, the lack of information on stratification is a limitation.
