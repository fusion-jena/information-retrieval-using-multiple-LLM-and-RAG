Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of training models on datasets that resemble the data on which the model will be applied, and the issue of data drift or domain drift. It also mentions domain adaptation as a field of machine learning that deals with discrepancies across domain distributions. 

However, it does not provide specific techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to handle imbalanced datasets or biased data, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
