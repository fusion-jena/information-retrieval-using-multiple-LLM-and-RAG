Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classification models (kNN and RF) are:

1. Overall accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the dataset.
2. Overall producer's accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances for each LULC class.
3. Kappa statistics: This is a measure of inter-rater agreement or accuracy, which takes into account the possibility of the correct classification occurring by chance.
4. 95% Confidence Interval (CI): This is a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but they are not reported in this specific study.
