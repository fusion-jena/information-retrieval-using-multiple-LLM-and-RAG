Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of handling large datasets, particularly in the field of ecology, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images.

However, it does mention the use of AI tools to process wildlife camera trap images, which may involve preprocessing techniques to address data bias. Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information on the techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the context of wildlife camera trap images.
