Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the ratio of 8:2, which suggests that the model is evaluated on a separate test set to estimate its performance on unseen data. This is a common practice to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and has some level of generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to further ensure generalizability. Therefore, it is unclear what additional measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability beyond the simple train-test split.
