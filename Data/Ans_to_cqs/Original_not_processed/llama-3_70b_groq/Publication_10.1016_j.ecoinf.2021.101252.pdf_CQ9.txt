Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the application of deep learning in ecology, the AutoML procedure, and the challenges of computational demand, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
