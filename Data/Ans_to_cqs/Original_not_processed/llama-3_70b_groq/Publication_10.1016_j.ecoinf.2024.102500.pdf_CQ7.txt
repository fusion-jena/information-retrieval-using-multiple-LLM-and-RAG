Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses grid search machine learning models with fivefold cross-validation, where the dataset is split into five equal-sized folds. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.

The context focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using cross-validation resampling, but it does not mention deep learning models or the specific criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
