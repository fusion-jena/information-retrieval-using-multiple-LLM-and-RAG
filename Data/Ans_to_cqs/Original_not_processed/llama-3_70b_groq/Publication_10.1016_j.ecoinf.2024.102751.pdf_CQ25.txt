Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the discussion of estimating soil moisture and developing a spatial modeling for VWC (Volumetric Water Content) on reclaimed spoil heap, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for regression tasks, such as predicting soil moisture levels.
