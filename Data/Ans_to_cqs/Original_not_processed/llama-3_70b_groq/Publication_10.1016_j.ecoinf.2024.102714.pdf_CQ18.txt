Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the accuracy assessment was done using the GMEP data, as shown in Fig. 5, which illustrates the strategy for accuracy assessment using GMEP data. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using the GMEP data, but the specific strategy or metrics used during training are not mentioned.
