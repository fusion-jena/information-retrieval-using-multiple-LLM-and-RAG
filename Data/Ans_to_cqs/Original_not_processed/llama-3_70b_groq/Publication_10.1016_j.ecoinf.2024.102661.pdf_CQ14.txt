Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the TPEBO (Tree-based Parzen Estimator Bayesian Optimization) algorithm. This algorithm is described as having a strategic approach to hyperparameter optimization, which involves an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations, followed by a progressive narrowing down of the focus to zones within the search space where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global optimum with increasing precision. This approach is particularly beneficial for fine-tuning LSTM models, known for their intricate structures. The TPEBO algorithm utilizes a probabilistic model to guide the identification and selection of optimal hyperparameter combinations, incorporating a probabilistic approach to continuously refine the optimization based on objective function assessments.
