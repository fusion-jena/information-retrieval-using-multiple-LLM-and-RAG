Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of RNNs, transfer learning, and their applications in the agricultural sector. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
