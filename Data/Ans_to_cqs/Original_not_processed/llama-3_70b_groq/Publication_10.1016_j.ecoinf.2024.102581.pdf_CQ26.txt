Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of a CNN model using a specific optimization algorithm and provides a comparison of the proposed approach with other existing models on various classification tasks. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
