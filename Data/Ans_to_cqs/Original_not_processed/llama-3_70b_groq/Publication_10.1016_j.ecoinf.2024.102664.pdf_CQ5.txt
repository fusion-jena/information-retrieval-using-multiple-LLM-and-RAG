Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022, using various deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models. The input data is likely time series data related to algal blooms, but the specific dataset is not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
