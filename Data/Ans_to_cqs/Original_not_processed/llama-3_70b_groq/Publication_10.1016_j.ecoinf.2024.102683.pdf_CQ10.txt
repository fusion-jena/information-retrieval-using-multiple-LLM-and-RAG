Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture and performance of the SCAM-Herb model, a deep learning model for plant image recognition, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
