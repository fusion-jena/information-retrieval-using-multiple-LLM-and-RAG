Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing a model for predicting the presence or absence of Hyphantria cunea, a species of moth, based on various environmental and biological factors. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, Cox & Snell R2, and Nagelkerke R2, but the specific model architecture and hyperparameters are not mentioned.
