Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on explaining the components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and their functions, such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. It also discusses the types of pooling operations, namely Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling, and the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations.

However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that are typically performed before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, or handling missing values. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for model training, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
