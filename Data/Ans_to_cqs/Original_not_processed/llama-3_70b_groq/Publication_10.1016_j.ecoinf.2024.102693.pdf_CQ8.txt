Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various deep learning models, including CNN, Transformer, and ViT, and their applications in computer vision tasks. It does not provide any information about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
