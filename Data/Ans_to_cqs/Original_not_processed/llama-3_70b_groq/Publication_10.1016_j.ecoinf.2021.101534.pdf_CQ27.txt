Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the model training and evaluation, including the model architecture, training settings, and test dataset used. There is no information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
