Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, environmental covariates, and sampling bias, but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
