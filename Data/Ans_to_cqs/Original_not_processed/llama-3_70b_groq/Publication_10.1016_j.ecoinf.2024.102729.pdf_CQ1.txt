Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, acoustic sensors are mentioned in one of the references (Hou et al., 2022). Additionally, the text mentions "conventional on-site sampling" and "low-frequency monitoring" which suggests that sensors may be used for data collection. However, it does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection in the provided context.
