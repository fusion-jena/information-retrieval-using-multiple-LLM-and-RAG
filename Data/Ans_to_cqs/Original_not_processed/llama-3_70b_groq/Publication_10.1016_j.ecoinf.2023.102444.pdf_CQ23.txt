Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, except for a brief mention in a citation (Deneu et al., 2022) where tSNE (another dimensionality reduction method) was used to visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural network. However, the main focus of the text is on the application of UMAP (a dimensionality reduction method) to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables.

There is no mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The text primarily discusses the application of UMAP and its potential limitations, but does not provide information on the specific query.
