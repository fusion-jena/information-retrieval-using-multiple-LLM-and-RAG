Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Trees, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Additionally, there is no mention of a deep learning model being used in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
