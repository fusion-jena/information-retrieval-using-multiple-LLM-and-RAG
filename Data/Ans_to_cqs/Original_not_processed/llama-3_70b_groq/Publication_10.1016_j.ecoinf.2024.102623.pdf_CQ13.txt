Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs.
* The optimizer used is AdamW.
* The weight decay and learning rate are both set to 0.0001.
* A learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 is employed.
* Dropout is also used, but the specific dropout rate is not mentioned.

Note that the architecture of the model consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons, with residual connections, batch normalization, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification.
