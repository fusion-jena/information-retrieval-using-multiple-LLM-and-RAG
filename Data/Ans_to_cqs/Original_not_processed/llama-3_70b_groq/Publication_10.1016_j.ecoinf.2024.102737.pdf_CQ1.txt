Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the recognition of bluespotted ribbontail rays using deep learning and discusses various aspects such as pose handling, data augmentation, and feature extraction enhancement. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

It can be inferred that the authors have access to an "individuals labeled database" which was used for the initial experiments, but the context does not elaborate on how this database was created or what methods were used to collect the raw data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
