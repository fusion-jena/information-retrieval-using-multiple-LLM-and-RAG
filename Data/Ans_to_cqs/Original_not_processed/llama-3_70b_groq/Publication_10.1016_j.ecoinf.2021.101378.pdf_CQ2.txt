Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease in South Korea using machine learning algorithms, and it mentions the use of environmental variables and land-use types as input data. The data is extracted from digital maps using a geographic information system (GIS) program, but the specific format of the data is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot determine the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
