Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that satellite images are used as input data, specifically from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites. The context mentions the use of RGB, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands, which suggests that the input data is in the form of multispectral or hyperspectral images. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format typically used for tabular data, which is not relevant to the context of satellite image classification.

Therefore, the answer is that the data format used in the pipeline is likely to be image data, specifically multispectral or hyperspectral images.
