Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on discussing weakly-labeled settings, structurally incomplete labels, and the task of predicting global vegetation cover. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
