Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only provides information about the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing, but it does not discuss any techniques used to improve the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
