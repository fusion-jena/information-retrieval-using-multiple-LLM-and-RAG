Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a research article about wetland use intensity in East Africa, and it discusses methodology, plot locations, and keywords such as Earth observation and Sentinel-2. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
