Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. It also mentions the use of XGBoost for Fv/Fm parameter estimation and SIF retrievals from satellite instruments. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
