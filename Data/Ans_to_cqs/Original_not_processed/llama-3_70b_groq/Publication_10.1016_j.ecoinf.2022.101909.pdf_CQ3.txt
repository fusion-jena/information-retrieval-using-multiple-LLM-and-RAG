Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning with the ResNet50 model, the architecture of the implemented CNN, and the use of pre-trained models on ImageNet data. It also mentions other datasets and architectures that can be used for pre-training, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
