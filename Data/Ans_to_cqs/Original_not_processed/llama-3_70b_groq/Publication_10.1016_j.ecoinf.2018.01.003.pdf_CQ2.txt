Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the development and application of neural networks, including deep learning, and provides mathematical formulations for neural network models. It also references various research papers and studies on ecological footprint models, but does not provide information on data formats used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The answer may depend on the specific use case or application of deep learning, and the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the data formats used.
