Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental settings, model architecture, and validation process. It does mention data augmentation, where the training dataset is augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular experiment.
