Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are mean Average Precision (mAP) and a custom metric Eα. mAP is used to evaluate the PASCAL VOC challenge dataset, and it takes the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. The subscript 50 in mAP50 refers to the requirement that the area of the intersection of ground truth bounding box and predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

The custom metric Eα is a weighted harmonic mean between specificity S and recall R, with α ∈ [0, 1] and S, R ∈ (0, 1]. Eα reduces to R for α = 0 and to S for α = 1, while E0.5 considers specificity and recall with equal weight. The authors also mention that Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is sometimes used for classification, but it is not used in this case because it does not allow mediating between the two use cases.

There is no mention of accuracy in the provided context.
