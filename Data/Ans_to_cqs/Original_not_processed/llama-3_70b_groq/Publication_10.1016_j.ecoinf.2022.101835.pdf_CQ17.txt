Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are L1 regularization and L2 regularization. These are mentioned in the context as hyperparameters to be optimized for the LightGBM model, specifically as lambda_l1 and lambda_l2. 

There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context. However, it is a common regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but it is not mentioned in this specific context.
