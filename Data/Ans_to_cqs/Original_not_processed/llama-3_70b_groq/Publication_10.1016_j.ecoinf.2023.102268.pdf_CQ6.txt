Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions that the spectrogram images are input into the pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network, and the activations from a deep, fully connected layer within this network are extracted and passed to a one-vs-all support-vector-machine classifier. 

It does not provide information on whether any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning were performed on the data before training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
