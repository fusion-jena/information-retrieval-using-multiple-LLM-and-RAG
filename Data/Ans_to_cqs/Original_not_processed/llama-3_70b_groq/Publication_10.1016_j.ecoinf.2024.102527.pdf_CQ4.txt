Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on model training, hyper-parameters, and transfer learning strategies for empty image recognition. It discusses the use of the ResNext-101 model, data splitting, and the optimization of update layers, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
