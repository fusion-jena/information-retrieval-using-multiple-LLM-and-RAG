Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from images, specifically LUCAS images (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) taken in 2018. These images are classified into different land use/cover classes such as cropland and grasslands. Additionally, orthophotos and topographic maps are also used in the pipeline. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. It can be inferred that the data is collected from public datasets, specifically the LUCAS dataset, which is a publicly available dataset provided by the European Commission.
