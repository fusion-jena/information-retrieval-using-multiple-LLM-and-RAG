Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the settings for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with and without overfitting, and the implications of overfitting on model performance and privacy.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention random selection of supervised samples to serve as reference images, with 25 samples per individual. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the selection of reference images, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, as it ensures reproducibility of results. However, this is not mentioned in the provided context.
