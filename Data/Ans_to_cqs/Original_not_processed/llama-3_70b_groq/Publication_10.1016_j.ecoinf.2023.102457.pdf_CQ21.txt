Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the BirdNET model, its architecture, and its performance in extracting embeddings for bird species classification. It also presents the results of experiments comparing the performance of different feature extraction techniques, including BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec2, and acoustic indices.

However, based on the figures presented, it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps were involved, such as calculating classification accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for clustering. The figures also show mean and 95% confidence intervals for these metrics, indicating that some statistical analysis was performed.

But, the context does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix calculation. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
