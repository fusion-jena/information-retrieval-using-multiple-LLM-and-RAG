Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, which is a remote sensing method that uses laser light to scan and create high-resolution 3D point clouds of objects and environments.

This inference is drawn from the references to papers that use LiDAR data, such as "Deep-learning-based tree classification using mobile LiDAR data" and "Weakly supervised segmentation-aided classification of urban scenes from 3D lidar point clouds". Additionally, the mention of ALS (Airborne Laser Swathmapping) point cloud in one of the references suggests that airborne LiDAR surveys may also be used for data collection.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as one of the references mentions a large-scale point cloud classification benchmark called Semantic3D.net. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
