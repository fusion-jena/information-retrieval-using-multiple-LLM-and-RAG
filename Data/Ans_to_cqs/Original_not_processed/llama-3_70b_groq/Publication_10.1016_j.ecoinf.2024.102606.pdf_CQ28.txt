Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning in computer vision for ecology, specifically for species identification, and mentions various techniques and models such as Faster R-CNN and Resnet50. It also mentions the use of ImageNet for pre-training, but it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
