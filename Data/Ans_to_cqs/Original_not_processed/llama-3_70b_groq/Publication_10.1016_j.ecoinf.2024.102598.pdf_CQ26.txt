Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a bootstrapping approach using the spThin package in R to address spatial sampling biases and spatial autocorrelation challenges. This approach involves 50 iterations of bootstrapping with a minimum thinning distance of 1 km, resulting in 12,577 unique locations. This process effectively minimizes the removal of records while mitigating sampling bias.

It does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
