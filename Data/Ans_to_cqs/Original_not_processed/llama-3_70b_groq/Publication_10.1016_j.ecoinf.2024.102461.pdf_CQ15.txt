Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used in these algorithms. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
