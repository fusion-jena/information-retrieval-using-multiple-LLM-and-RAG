Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various aspects of deep neural networks, such as bottleneck architecture, shortcut connections, global average pooling, and skip connections, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. 

The context does mention the use of optimization algorithms like SGDM and ADAM, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
