Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the setup used for training and testing the model, including the PC specifications and the TensorFlow framework. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
