Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses data splitting and image tiling, model performance, and validation procedures, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
