Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the hardware and software used for training the model, such as a personal computer with a 1060Ti GPU, Ubuntu 20.04 operating system, CUDA v10.1, Python version 3.7, and various libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and OpenCV. There is no mention of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the deployment platform from the given information.
