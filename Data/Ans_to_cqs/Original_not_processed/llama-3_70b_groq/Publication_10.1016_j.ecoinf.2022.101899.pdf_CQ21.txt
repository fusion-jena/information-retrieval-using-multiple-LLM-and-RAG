Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model training process, including the number of burn-in steps, thinning steps, and chains, as well as the model efficiency and implementation time. It also explains the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach used to consider model uncertainty and the calculation of posterior model probabilities and Bayes factors.

However, it does not mention specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. These steps are typically used to evaluate and interpret the performance of machine learning models, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
