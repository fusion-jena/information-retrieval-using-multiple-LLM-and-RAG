Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters. It discusses the importance of considering parameters such as sample distribution, atmospheric correction algorithms, and creating a representative dataset for developing a generalizable ML-based model.

However, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning, for developing semi-empirical models that can eliminate irrelevant spectral wavelengths and unravel complex relationships between response and predictor variables.

It does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
