Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions "Drone imagery" and "remote sensing" which suggests that the input data is in the form of images captured by drones. Additionally, the object detection models mentioned, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, are commonly used for image-based object detection tasks. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV is not a typical format for image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
