Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the selection of hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer, learning rate, and number of epochs, and the use of techniques like trial-and-error and early stopping to prevent overfitting. It also discusses the importance of generalization competence and the use of cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
