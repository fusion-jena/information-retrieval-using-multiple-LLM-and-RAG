Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. It discusses the use of a deeply supervised approach, the loss function, and the experimental results. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as calculating metrics, generating confusion matrices, or processing saliency maps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
