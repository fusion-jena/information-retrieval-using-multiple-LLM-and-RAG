Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, ecology, and forestry-related topics, with some mentions of machine learning and neural networks. However, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
