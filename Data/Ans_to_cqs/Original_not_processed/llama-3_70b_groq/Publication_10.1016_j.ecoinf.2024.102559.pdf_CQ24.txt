Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on developing a random forest (RF) binary classification model to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation using NAIP scenes. 

However, it does mention that each tree in the RF is created using a subset of the training data randomly sampled with replacement, and a user-defined number of features is randomly selected from the data's features to grow the tree at each splitting node. This implies that randomness is inherently present in the RF model development process.

Since the context does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
