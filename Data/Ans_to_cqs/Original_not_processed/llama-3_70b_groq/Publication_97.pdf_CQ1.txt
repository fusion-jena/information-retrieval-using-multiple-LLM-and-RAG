Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from satellite images. The context mentions "satellite images presented in Table 1" and "sub-images of size 256 Ã— 256 that were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images". This suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite imaging, which is a common method in remote sensing applications.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that satellite imaging is the method utilized for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a general answer to the query, but rather a specific answer related to the particular application of deep learning in vegetation science and forestry.
