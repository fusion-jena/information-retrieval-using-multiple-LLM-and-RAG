Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model. The RF model's performance is evaluated using out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation. However, it does not provide specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. 

It's possible that the query is referring to a different model or context, but based on the provided information, it's not possible to determine the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model.
