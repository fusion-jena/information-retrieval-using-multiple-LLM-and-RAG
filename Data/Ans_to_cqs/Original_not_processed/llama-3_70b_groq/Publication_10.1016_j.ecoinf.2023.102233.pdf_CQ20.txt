Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the active learning approach, hyperparameter tuning, and the application of the model to bird call recognition, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used.
