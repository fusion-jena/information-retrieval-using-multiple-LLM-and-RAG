Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the use of TensorFlow, Python 3, and the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system for implementing and training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam, used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
