Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and training of various deep learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, and their performance evaluation using metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE. It also provides details on the hyperparameters and structural architecture of these models. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.
