Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for vegetation pattern classification, but it does not include any references to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
