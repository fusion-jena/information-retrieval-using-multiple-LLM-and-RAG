Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on optimizing model performance by reducing memory access, reconfiguring computation sequences, and implementing efficient convolutional layers. It also discusses the integration of attention mechanisms and the effects of model scale on accuracy and inference speed. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
