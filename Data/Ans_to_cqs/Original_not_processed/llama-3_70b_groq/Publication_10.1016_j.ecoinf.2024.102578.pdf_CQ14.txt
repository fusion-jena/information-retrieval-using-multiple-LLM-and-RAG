Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only provides definitions of model performance metrics, the performance of the image quality model on the test data, and a brief mention of workflow performance. There is no information about hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
