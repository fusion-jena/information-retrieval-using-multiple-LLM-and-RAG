Answer:::

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. To ensure the generalizability of the GBRT models, several measures were taken.

Firstly, the data was split into training, validation, and test sets. The validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, and the test set was used to evaluate the final model's performance. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Secondly, two different data splitting approaches were used: random splitting and year-based splitting. The random splitting approach is considered optimal in machine learning as it does not introduce systematic differences between the test and train datasets. The year-based splitting approach was used for the RY models, which ensures that the model is tested on previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables.

Lastly, hyperparameter tuning was performed using a grid search and manual tuning. The learning rate and maximum tree depth were adjusted to optimize the model's performance.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the GBRT models include data splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of different splitting approaches.
