Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc. The context only discusses the application of deep learning in fish biomass estimation, mentions the use of a fully automatic system, and compares the results of the proposed method with other methods. It does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
