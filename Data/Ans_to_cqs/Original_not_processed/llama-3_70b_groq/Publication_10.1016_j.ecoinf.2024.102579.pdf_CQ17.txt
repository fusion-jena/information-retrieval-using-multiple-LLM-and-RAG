Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as sampling errors, diversity indices, and estimators in forest inventories. There is no mention of deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context does not provide any information about the query, and therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer.
