Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a research paper discussing various topics, including ecological sustainability, farmer behavioral decision-making, and crop management system optimization. It also mentions various machine learning models and techniques, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
