Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing a study on YouTube videos related to wild birds, where the authors extracted video metadata and thumbnail characteristics. The data analysis was performed using R software with various packages, but there is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
