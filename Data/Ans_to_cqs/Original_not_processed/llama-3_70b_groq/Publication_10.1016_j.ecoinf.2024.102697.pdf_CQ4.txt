Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, and their application in remote sensing. It also describes the machine learning training methodology used, including the use of repeated nested k-fold cross-validation. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
