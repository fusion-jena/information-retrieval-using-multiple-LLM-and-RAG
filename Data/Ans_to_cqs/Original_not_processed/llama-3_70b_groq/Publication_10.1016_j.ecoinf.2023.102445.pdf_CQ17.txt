Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, network architecture, and evaluation indices of the YOLO_MRC model. It discusses the ablation experiments, training parameters, and comparison with other models, but it does not provide information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
