Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. It only mentions that the overall process follows current best practices in deep learning, which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017). This suggests that the model might be built using Keras, as Fran√ßois Chollet is the author of Keras. However, it does not provide a direct confirmation of the framework used. Therefore, I don't know the exact framework used to build the deep learning model.
