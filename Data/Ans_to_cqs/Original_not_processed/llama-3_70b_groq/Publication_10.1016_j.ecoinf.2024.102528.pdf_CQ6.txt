Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the BirdNET-Analyzer model, for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations. It discusses the framework, the model's performance, and related research in the field of bioacoustic monitoring.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning models, it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in preparing the data for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.

If you're looking for general information on common preprocessing steps involved in deep learning, I can provide some general insights. Typically, preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, feature extraction, and data augmentation, depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, without specific information about the BirdNET-Analyzer model or the dataset used, I cannot provide more detailed information on the preprocessing steps involved.
