Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on various topics, including stochastic gradient boosting, neural networks, biomass estimation, and soil information, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Randomness can be introduced in deep learning models through various sources, such as random initialization of weights, random shuffling of training data, and random dropout. To handle this randomness, several strategies can be employed, including:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques such as cross-validation to average out the effects of randomness.
3. Employing ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations.
4. Using regularization techniques, such as dropout, to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
