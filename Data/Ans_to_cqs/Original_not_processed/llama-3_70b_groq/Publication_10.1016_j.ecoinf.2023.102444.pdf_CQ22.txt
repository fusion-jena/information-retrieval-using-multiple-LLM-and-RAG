Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) as a binary classifier. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of UMAP are:

1. Area Under the Curve (AUC)
2. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
3. Kappa index (K)
4. Point-biserial correlation (COR) index

These metrics are commonly used to assess species distribution models. The AUC and kappa index range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance. The COR index is similar to the correlation coefficient but applied to a binary response.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but they are not mentioned in this specific context.
