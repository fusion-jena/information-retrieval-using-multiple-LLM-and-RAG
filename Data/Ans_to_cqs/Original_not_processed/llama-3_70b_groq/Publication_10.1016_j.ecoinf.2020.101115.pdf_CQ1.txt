Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the Marine Institute's (MI) data management process for a fish scale and otolith collection, which involves storing, uploading metadata, and imaging samples. It discusses the importance of metadata, such as fish sampling location, date, species, and life stage, and the use of controlled vocabularies for consistent and accurate information labelling.

There is no mention of deep learning pipelines, surveys, sensors, or public datasets in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline based on the given information.

In summary, the answer to the query is unknown based on the provided context.
