Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on synthetic data, and its performance was tested on real MS point clouds, which suggests that the authors attempted to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's efficiency was tested by inferring real MS point clouds, which implies that the model was evaluated on a separate dataset from the one it was trained on. This could be seen as a form of validation, but it is not clear if this was done using techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. 

Overall, without more information, it is difficult to say what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
