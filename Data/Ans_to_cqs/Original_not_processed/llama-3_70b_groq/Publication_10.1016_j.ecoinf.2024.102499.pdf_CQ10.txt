Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions that the model parameters can be found on the TensorFlow model zoo under the name "faster_rcnn_nas", but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
