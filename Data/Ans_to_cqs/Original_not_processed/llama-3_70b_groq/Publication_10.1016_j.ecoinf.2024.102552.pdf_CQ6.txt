Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools for classification, but it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. 

The context focuses more on the limitations of machine learning methods, the importance of high-quality inputs, and the tradeoffs between qualitative and quantitative analysis in classification schemes. It also discusses the manual classification method used in the study, its limitations, and the advantages of having multiple classifiers working together.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
