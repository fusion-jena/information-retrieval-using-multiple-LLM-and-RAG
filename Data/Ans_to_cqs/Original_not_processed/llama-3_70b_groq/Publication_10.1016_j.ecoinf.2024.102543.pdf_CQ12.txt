Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), specifically a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which is a real-time object detection system. This is evident from the mention of YOLOv8 and its variants (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x) in the context. The context also discusses the addition of layers, filters, and convolutional layers, which are typical components of a CNN architecture.
