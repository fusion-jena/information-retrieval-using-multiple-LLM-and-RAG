Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context only mentions the number of epochs used for training, which is 60 epochs for models with less than 100 layers and 80 epochs for models with 100 layers or more. It does not provide information on how the training process is terminated or what conditions are used to stop the training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
