Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on air quality prediction, pollution, and related topics, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline implementation or regularization techniques.

The only mention of deep learning is in the first paper, which uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for predicting air quality, but it does not discuss regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.

If you're looking for general information on regularization methods, I can provide some general knowledge. Common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. However, this information is not derived from the provided context.
