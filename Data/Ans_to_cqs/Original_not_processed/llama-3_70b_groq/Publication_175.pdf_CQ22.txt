Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the mean accuracy (i.e., percentage of correct classification). This is mentioned in the results section, where it is stated that the deep ResNet model trained on the large AT0 dataset obtained a mean accuracy of 78.00% (standard deviation of 15.16%) on the T2 test-dataset. 

There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. being used to evaluate the performance of the model. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the model's performance in this study.
