Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training phases, and data augmentation techniques used for the fish detection task in turbid water. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
