Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the study employed five metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, namely:

1. Accuracy (A)
2. Precision (P)
3. Recall (R)
4. F1-score (F1)
5. Intersection over Union (IOU)

These metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, Res_AUNet, for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. The calculation formulas for these metrics are mentioned in the context, but not provided.
