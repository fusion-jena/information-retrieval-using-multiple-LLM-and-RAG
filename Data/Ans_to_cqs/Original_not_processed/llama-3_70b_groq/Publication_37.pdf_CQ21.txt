Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the introduction, method, and summary of the paper, which explores the automated classification of migrating birds' flight calls using convolutional neural networks and data augmentation. It discusses the evaluation of the models on a dataset and compares their performance with a baseline model. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
