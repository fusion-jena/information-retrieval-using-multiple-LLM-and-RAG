Answer: The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "The algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B." This suggests that the code is available as supplementary material, but the exact location of the repository is not specified. It could be available on the journal's website or as a downloadable file, but it is not hosted on a public code repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
