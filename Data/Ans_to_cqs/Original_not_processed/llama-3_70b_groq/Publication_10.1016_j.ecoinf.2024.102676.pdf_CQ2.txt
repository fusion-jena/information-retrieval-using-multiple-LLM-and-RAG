Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions "images of footprints" and "images of all qualities" being used in the experiments. Additionally, the rating system for landmarks within each footprint image suggests that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used. While CSV is not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store metadata or annotations related to the image data, but this is not explicitly stated.
