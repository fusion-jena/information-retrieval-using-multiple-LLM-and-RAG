Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application of BirdNET, a research project for automated bird species identification, and its performance evaluation. It discusses the settings adjusted in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
