Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus on the application of deep learning-based methods for analyzing bacterial abundance and morphology in a soil-analogue environment using micro-fluidic platforms. The context discusses the importance of image analysis-based methods for quantifying bacterial populations and detecting differences among bacterial communities from different locations.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through image acquisition using micro-fluidic platforms, which provide a soil-analogue environment for studying bacterial abundance and morphology. The images obtained from these platforms are then used to train and validate the deep learning model for segmenting and classifying various objects.

It is not clear if surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in this specific pipeline. Further information would be required to determine the exact methods used for data collection.
