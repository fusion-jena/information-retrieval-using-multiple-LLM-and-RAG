Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on the use of ensemble deep learning models for plant disease classification, and it discusses the performance of different models and ensembles on a dataset of RGB images of healthy and damaged crop leaves. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
