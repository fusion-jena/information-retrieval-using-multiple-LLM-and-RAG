Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models mentioned are Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121, which are all variants of CNNs. These models are commonly used for image classification tasks, which is consistent with the animal classification application mentioned in the context.
