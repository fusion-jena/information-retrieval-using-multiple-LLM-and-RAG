Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation, specifically the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). Additionally, the context mentions the application of committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
