Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the use of a pre-trained EfficientNet B0 network, which was originally trained on a generic image classification task, but it does not specify the exact dataset used for that task. It also mentions that the network is fine-tuned on a new dataset of spectrograms representing audio data, but it does not provide the name of this dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
