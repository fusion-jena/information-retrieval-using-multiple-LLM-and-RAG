Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the pipeline are primarily raster and vector data formats. The table provided lists various datasets, including DEM, Land use, NDVI, Soil data, Population, GDP, Meteorological data, and Vector data, with their corresponding spatial resolutions and data sources.

The raster data formats are used for datasets such as DEM, Land use, NDVI, Soil data, Population, GDP, and Meteorological data, with spatial resolutions ranging from 30m to 1km. The Vector data format is used for one of the datasets, but the specific details are not provided.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the context. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data formats used in the pipeline are primarily raster and vector data formats, with no evidence of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats being used.
