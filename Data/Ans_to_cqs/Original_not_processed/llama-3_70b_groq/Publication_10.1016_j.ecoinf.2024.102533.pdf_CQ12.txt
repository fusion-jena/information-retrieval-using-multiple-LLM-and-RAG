Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mentions "deep learning for automated fish grading" in the Jayasundara et al. (2023) paper, but it does not specify the type of model used. It also mentions other papers related to fish freshness categorization using artificial neural networks and support vector machines, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used.
