Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including SVM, U-Net, RF, and DNN. The overall accuracy is calculated using Equation (2), and the kappa coefficient is calculated using Equation (3). However, it does not mention other metrics such as precision and recall.
