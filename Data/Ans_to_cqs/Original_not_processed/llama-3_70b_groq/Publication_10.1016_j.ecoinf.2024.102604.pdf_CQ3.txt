Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and discusses various methods such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) for predicting species distributions. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
