Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is being used to create a PAM (Passive Acoustic Monitoring) classifier, which suggests that the goal is to classify audio recordings into different categories, such as presence or absence of a particular species. The model is trained on annotated examples of calls and is used to find new examples, which are then incorporated into the training set to improve the classifier. The ultimate goal is to create a robust classifier that can accurately identify the presence of a species based on its vocalizations.
