Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the concept of deep learning, neural networks, and the implementation details of a specific model. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
