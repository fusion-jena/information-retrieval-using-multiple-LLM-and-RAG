Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for wildfire events, the FIREMAP burned area product, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for wildfire science. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
