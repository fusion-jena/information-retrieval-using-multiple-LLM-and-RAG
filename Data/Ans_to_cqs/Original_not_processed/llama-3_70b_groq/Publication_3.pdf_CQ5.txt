Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the data are publicly available via Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. This suggests that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset of audio recordings of bird species, rather than a standard computer vision dataset.
