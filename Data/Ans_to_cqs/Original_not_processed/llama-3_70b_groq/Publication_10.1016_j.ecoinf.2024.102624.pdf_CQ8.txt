Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning techniques for classifying aquatic plant communities using remote sensing data. It mentions various studies and references, but does not provide information about a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
