Answer: 

The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather as a feature-based and shape-match classification of animal population time series. The keywords mentioned in the abstract, such as "Machine learning", "Hierarchical clustering", and "Trend analysis", suggest that the model is used for classification and trend analysis of population time series data. There is no indication of segmentation or detection being the purpose of the model.
