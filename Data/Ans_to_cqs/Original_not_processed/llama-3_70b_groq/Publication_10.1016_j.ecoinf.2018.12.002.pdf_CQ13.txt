Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and CARTs, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters like learning rate and optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
