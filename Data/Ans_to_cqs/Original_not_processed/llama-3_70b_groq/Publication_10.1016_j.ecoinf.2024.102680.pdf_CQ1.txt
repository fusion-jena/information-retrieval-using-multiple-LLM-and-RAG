Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the challenges of underwater optical images, the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network, and the proposed solutions to improve feature extraction and object detection. It also mentions the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computational complexity. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
