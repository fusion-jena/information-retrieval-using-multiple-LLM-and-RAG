Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on machine learning, specifically Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), and does not delve into deep learning.

However, it does mention random splitting of individual observations into train and test datasets, as well as randomly selecting years for inclusion in the train and test datasets (RY data splitting). This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data preparation stage, but it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
