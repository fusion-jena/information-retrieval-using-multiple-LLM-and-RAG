Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context discusses the use of XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework, and its application in land use/land cover classification and forest type classification, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
