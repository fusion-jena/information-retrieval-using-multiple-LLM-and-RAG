Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization, the selection of predictors from S2 imagery, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
