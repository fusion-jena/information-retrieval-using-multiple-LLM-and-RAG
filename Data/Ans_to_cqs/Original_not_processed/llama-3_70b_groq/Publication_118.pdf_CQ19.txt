Answer:::
Answer: PyTorch.

The context mentions that the architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in "Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch" by github user "eelxpeng" (eelxpeng, 2018). This suggests that PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model. There is no mention of TensorFlow or any other framework.
