Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application and performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, particularly the backpropagation (BP) training algorithm, in regression analyses. It discusses the importance of dataset quality and quantity, the structure of ANN models, and the use of the 'neuralnet' package in R software for developing a BP-ANN model. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that should be taken before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
