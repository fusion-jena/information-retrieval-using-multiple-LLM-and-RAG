Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, CNN, RNN, Transformer, or any other related terms. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and urban planning, with references to research papers on topics such as habitat suitability, urban heat-prone areas, and ecosystem health benefits. There is no mention of a pipeline or deep learning models, so it is not possible to determine the type of model used.
