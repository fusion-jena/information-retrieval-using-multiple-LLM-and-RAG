Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a section of a research paper discussing the results of some experiments, possibly related to ecological informatics. There is no mention of a code repository or a specific platform where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
