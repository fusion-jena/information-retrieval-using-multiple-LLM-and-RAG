Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any others. It only discusses the architecture of the model, which consists of an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. It also mentions the activation functions used, but it does not provide information about the framework used to build the model.
