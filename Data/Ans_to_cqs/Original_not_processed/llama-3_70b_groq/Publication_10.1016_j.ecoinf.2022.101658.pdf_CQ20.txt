Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology, datasets, and algorithms used in the study, but does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
