Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used to classify bird species based on their sounds. The model is trained to identify and distinguish between different bird species from their audio recordings. The classification performance is evaluated using metrics such as balanced accuracy and weighted F1-score, which indicates that the model is designed to classify bird species into their respective categories.
