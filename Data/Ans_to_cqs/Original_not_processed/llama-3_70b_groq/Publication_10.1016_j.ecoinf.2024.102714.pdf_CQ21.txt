Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that post-classification refinement was undertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas. This involved obtaining additional training data in areas known to be misclassified through aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits.

There is no mention of Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix as post-processing steps. The focus seems to be on refining the classification results through additional data collection and reclassification.

It is possible that other post-processing steps were involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
