Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to particle filters, Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, and parallel computing using GPUs and CPUs, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
