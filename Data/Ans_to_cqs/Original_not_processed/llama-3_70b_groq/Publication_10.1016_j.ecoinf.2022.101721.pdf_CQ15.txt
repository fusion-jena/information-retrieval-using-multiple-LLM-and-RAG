Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to bat species identification using machine learning and bioacoustics, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
