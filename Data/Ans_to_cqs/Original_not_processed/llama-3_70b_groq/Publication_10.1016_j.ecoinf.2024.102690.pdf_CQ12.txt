Answer: 

The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions the use of an unsupervised learning neural network approach called Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. SOFM is a type of neural network, but it is not a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It is a traditional neural network approach used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
