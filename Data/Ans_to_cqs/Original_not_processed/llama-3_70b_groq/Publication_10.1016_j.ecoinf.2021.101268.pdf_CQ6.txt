Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing is being applied, as there are separate results for "Raw" and "Pre-processed" data.

The text mentions that "The pre-processing stage reduces noises and standardizes inputs, which enhances metrics." This suggests that the preprocessing steps may include noise reduction and standardization, but the exact steps are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a background removal algorithm, which may be part of the preprocessing pipeline. However, the exact details of the preprocessing steps are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved, but it can be inferred that some form of noise reduction and standardization are likely involved.
