Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The context mentions the calculation of classification performances, including overall accuracy, user accuracy, and producer accuracy, which are typically calculated from a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is not explicitly shown, but the accuracy metrics are presented in Table 2. 

There is no mention of saliency maps, which are a technique used to interpret the output of a model, in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if saliency maps were used as a postprocessing step.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as indicated by the provided context, include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix. However, it is unclear if saliency maps were used.
