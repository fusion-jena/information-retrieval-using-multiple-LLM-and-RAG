Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline or any specific platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It discusses the SMARTLAGOON project, the development of a satellite data collection tool, and the architecture of the tool, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The context mentions a README.md file in the repository, but it does not specify the location or platform of the repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
