Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for bird sound recognition and classification. It discusses various techniques to improve the performance of these models, including the use of attention mechanisms, residual connections, and label hierarchy transformation. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
