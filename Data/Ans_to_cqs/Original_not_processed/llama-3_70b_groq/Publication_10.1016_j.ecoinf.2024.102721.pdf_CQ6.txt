Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM, for forecasting ecological water demand and scenario analysis of oasis NDVI. It discusses the structure and functionality of the LSTM model, SHAP values, and scenario analysis, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
