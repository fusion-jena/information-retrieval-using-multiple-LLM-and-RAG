Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The machine learning models mentioned are Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
