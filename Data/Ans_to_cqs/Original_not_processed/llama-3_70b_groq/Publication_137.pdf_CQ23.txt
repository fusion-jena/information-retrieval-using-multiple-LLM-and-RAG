Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the hold-out method was used to distinguish the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets, but it does not provide information on whether the split was stratified or if cross-validation was used. Additionally, there is no mention of the diversity of the dataset or any other measures taken to ensure generalizability.
