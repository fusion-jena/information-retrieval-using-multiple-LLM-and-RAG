Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (artificial neural network, ANN). However, it does mention some metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the models in general.

For instance, the context mentions the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements, which is 1.904 (95% CI: 1.89â€“1.92) for the ANN model. It also mentions the mean absolute difference (MAD) between the predicted and actual SPAD values, which is 1.85 for the linear model (LM) and 1.79 for the generalized linear model (GLM).

Additionally, the context mentions R-squared values, which is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model. The R-squared values are 0.81 for both the LM and GLM models.

However, it does not mention traditional deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
