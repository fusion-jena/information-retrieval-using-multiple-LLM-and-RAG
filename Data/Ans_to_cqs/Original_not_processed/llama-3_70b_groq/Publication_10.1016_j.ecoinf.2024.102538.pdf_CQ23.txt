Answer: The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include stratified sampling and dataset splitting. The datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing to compare the experimental results. This splitting helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data. Additionally, stratified sampling was used to select birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018, which helps to maintain the same class distribution in the training, validation, and testing sets. This approach ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on a representative sample of the data, which improves its generalizability. However, there is no mention of cross-validation or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context.
