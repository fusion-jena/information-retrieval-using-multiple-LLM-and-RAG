Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions PyCharm software, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding and development, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Additionally, it mentions Matlab, which is a programming language and environment, but it is not a deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the deployment platform used in this study.
