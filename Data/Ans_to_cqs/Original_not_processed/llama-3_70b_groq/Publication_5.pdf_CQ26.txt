Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning methods in various fields, such as remote sensing, image segmentation, and prediction tasks. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of data fusion and diverse data collection in overcoming data limitations. This implies that collecting diverse data can help mitigate data bias issues. Nevertheless, specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or other bias handling methods are not discussed in the provided context.

In summary, the answer to this query cannot be determined based on the provided context.
