Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions various research papers and datasets related to weed detection and machine learning, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The only link mentioned is to the "scholarly" Python library on GitHub, which is used for searching publications, but it is not related to a deep learning pipeline.
