Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the process of extracting videos from YouTube, filtering them based on specific keywords, and extracting relevant information such as thumbnail information, number of subscribers, and presence of wild bird species. It also mentions the use of a machine learning algorithm to examine the relationship between video views and important video factors, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
