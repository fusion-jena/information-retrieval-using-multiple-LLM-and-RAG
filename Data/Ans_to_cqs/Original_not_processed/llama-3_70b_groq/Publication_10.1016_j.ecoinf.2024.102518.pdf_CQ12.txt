Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text discusses species distribution modeling, regularization multipliers, and evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning architecture used. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of model is used in the pipeline.
