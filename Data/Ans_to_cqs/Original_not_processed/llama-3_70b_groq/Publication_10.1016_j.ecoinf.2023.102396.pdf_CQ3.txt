Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, animal population time series, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide any information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
