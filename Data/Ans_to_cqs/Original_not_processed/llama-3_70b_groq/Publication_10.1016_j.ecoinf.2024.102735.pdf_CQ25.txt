Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is prediction, specifically for HABs (Harmful Algal Blooms) monitoring and prediction. The models are used to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, algal cells, and toxins. The models mentioned include random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR). These models are used to identify patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem variables to make predictions about HABs.
