Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context appears to be object detection, specifically tracking and identifying target objects in a scene with high dynamic density and low training data. This is evident from the mention of YOLOv7 as the baseline model, which is a well-known object detection algorithm. Additionally, the text mentions the model's ability to balance limited computational power and speed, which is a common requirement in object detection tasks. Furthermore, the description of the YOLOv7 model's structure, including the input module, backbone module, and header network, is consistent with object detection architectures.
