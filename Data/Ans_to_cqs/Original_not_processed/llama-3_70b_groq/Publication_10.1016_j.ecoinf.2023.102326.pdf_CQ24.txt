Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, complex networks, and frequency correlation matrices, with discussions on land use types, urban forests, and network quantifiers. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
