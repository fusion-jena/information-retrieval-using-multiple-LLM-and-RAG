Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning models to predict diving behavior in seabirds using GPS and dive data, and compares the performance of these models with other behavioral prediction methods. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
