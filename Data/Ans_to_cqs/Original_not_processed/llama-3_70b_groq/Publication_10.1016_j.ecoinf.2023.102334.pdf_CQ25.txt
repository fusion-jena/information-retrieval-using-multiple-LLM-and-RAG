Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The main objective of the work mentioned is to create a model that accurately identifies sika deer. This implies that the model is intended to classify images as either containing a sika deer or not. The use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which is a type of deep learning model, supports this conclusion. ViT models are commonly used for image classification tasks, and the discussion of the model's ability to model global attention and relationships between pixels further suggests that the model is designed for classification.
