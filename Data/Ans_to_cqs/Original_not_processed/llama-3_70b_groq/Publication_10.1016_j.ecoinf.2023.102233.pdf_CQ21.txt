Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, hyperparameter tuning, and the annotation process. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may have been performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
