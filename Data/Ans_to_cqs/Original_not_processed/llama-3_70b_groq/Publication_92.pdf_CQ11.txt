Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only describes the pipeline's architecture, data preprocessing, and post-processing steps, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the data or pipeline is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
