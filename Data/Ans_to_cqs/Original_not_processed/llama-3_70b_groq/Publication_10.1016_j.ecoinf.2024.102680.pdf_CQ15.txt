Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the network, including the use of dilated convolution, depthwise separable convolution, and the LKSP module to improve the receptive field and feature extraction capabilities. It also mentions the batch size regulation, setting it to 16 uniformly. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
