Answer:::

According to the provided context, the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is image resizing. This is mentioned in Section 3.2, which states that the training dataset could be pre-processed, and image resizing was used to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
