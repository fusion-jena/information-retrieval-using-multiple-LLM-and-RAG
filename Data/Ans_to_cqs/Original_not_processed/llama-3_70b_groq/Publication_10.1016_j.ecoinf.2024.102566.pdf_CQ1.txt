Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation involve field-collected data and remote sensing imagery. Specifically, forest inventory data and small footprint LiDAR data are mentioned as sources of data. Additionally, remote sensing-based biomass estimation is discussed, suggesting that satellite or aerial imagery may be used to collect data.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as sources of raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that surveys or public datasets may be used in other studies or applications, but this is not explicitly stated in the given context.

It is also worth noting that the context focuses on biomass estimation in forest ecosystems, so the methods used for collecting raw data may be specific to this domain. In other domains, different methods may be used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
