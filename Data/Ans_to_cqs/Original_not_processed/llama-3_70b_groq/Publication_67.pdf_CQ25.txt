Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is designed to classify images into different tree cover classes in global drylands. The model is trained on a dataset of images with different levels of tree cover, and it is used to classify new images into these classes. The classification task involves assigning a label to each image based on its tree cover level, which can be one of the three tree cover classes or the "Non-Forest" class. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Inception v.3 architecture, which is commonly used for image classification tasks.
