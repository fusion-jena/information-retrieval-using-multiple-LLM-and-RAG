Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, there is no mention of deep learning models or their specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
