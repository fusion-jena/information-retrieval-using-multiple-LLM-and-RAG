Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model, nor does it mention any specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be discussing machine learning and geostatistics, with a focus on evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by statistical prediction methods. It discusses data splitting, resampling methods, and metrics for evaluating map accuracy, but does not provide any information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.
