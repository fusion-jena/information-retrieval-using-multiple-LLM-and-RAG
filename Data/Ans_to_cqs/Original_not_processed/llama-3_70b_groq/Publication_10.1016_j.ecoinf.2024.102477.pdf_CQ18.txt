Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the SVR model, its parameters, and its performance evaluation using metrics such as MAPE and RMSE, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
