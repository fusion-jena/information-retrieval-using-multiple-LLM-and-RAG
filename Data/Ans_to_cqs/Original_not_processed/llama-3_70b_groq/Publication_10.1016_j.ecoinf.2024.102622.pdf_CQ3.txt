Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and crop classification, discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data and machine learning methods like random forest classification for extracting crop-growing areas. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
