Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, land use land cover (LULC) mapping, and artificial neural network models. It mentions MODIS-TERRA sensor data and the MOD11A2 product, which provides 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. However, it does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
