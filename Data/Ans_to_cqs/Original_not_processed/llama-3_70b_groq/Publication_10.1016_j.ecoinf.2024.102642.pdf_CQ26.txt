Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context focuses on annotation campaigns, inter-annotator variability, and methods to aggregate annotation sets, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the initial training of annotators could be a source of bias, and it is recommended to make it as representative as possible of the datasets proposed and in line with the difficulty of the task. Additionally, the context suggests that instructing annotators to adopt a more conservative approach could be beneficial in future annotation campaigns.

In summary, the provided context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, but it highlights the importance of considering bias in the annotation process.
