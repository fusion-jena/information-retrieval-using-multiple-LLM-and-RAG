Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context appears to be discussing a model for predicting real-world phenomena such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, and it mentions parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind intensity. However, it does not provide any information about the data formats used in the model or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
