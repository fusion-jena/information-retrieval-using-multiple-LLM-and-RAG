Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the training process, architecture, and hyperparameters of different neural networks (PConv, Pix2Pix, and classification networks), but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
