Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. It only mentions the initial learning rate of 0.001, which is exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in this study.
