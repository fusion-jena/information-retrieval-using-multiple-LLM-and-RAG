Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset is small, and transfer learning is used to leverage existing knowledge from a pre-trained model (ResNet-34) on a broad dataset (ImageNet). This approach can help mitigate data bias to some extent.

Additionally, the context mentions that the image pool for each transect is tripled by incorporating multi-temporal data from a three-month span across three environments. This could be seen as a form of data augmentation, which can help increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce bias.

However, it does not explicitly mention any of the specific techniques listed in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used to address data bias in this particular pipeline.
