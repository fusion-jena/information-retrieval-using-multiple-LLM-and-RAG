Answer:::

Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to this query. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a study on acoustic data analysis using FDA (Functional Data Analysis) and provides various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
