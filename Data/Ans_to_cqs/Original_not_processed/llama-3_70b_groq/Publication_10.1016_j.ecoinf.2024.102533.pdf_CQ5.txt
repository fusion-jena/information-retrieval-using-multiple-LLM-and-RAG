Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and contains tables with abbreviations and numerical values, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
