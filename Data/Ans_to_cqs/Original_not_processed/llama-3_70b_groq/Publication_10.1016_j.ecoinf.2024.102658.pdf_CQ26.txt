Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses random forest models, feature selection, and cross-validation, but it does not mention deep learning or techniques to address data bias.

The context does mention cross-validation, which can help to reduce overfitting, but it does not specifically discuss techniques to address data bias. The context also mentions that collecting data is difficult and costly, which can lead to data bias, but it does not provide any solutions to address this issue.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
