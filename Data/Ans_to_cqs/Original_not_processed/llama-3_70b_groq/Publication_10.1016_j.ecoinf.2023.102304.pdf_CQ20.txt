Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and wildfire detection, discussing various indices and algorithms (e.g., LTR, NBR, BFAST, NDVI, EVI) and their applications in different forest types and regions. There is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources required to train them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
