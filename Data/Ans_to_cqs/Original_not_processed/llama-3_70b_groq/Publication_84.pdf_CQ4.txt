Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the application of phenological knowledge in deep learning for Landsat image classification, particularly for detecting invasive species. It discusses the benefits of using phenological features and the advantages of deep learning over traditional machine learning methods. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
