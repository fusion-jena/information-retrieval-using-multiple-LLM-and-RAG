Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics. However, it does provide information about the accuracy of landscape classification. 

According to the context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the landscape classification are:

1. User's accuracy (%)
2. Total accuracy (%)
3. Kappa coefficient

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the landscape classification from 1985 to 2020. The context does not provide information about precision, recall, or other metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
