Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, discussing the importance of various variables in predicting CLCuD using different machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network, Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree. There is no mention of a specific platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform being used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
