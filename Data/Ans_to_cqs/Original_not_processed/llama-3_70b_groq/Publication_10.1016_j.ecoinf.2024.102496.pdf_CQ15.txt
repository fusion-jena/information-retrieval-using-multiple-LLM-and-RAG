Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or any specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a tool for identifying locations that would benefit from the implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce pollutant loads, with features such as environmental justice indices, pollutant loads, and mapping capabilities. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
