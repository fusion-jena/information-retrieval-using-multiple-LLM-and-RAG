Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text describes the methodology and techniques used in the study, including the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the application of different normalization strategies. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
