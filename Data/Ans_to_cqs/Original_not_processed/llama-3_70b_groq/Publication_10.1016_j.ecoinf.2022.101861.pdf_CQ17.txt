Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bird research, specifically the detection of the Band-tailed Nighthawk using the Kaleidoscope Pro software. It discusses the signal parameters used for sound detection and the potential for geographical song variations to affect detection. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
