Answer:::
Answer: The PLUS model does not use a deep learning model in its pipeline. Instead, it employs a random forest algorithm in the LEAS module to obtain development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. There is no mention of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the provided context.
