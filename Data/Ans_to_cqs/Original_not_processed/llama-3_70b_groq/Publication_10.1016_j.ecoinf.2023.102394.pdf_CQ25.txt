Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically to predict Soil Organic Carbon Stocks (SOCS). The model is designed to establish a relationship between SOCS and environmental covariates such as topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biota. The model uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm, a type of feedforward artificial neural network, to predict SOCS values based on these environmental covariates.
