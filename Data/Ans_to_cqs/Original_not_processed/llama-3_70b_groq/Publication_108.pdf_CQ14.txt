Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that different hyperparameter settings were tested to find an optimal setting for the problem, and the results are presented in Table 1. However, it does not specify the method used to search for the optimal hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
