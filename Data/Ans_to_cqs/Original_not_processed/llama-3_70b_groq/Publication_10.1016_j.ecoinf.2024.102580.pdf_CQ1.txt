Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "2012 aerial imagery" in the data availability section, suggesting that aerial imagery might be one of the sources of raw data used in the study. 

It is also possible that the ground-truth imagery dataset developed in step (b) of the workflow (Fig. 1) might have been collected through surveys or other methods, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that aerial imagery is one of the sources of raw data, but the exact methods used for collecting this data are not specified.
