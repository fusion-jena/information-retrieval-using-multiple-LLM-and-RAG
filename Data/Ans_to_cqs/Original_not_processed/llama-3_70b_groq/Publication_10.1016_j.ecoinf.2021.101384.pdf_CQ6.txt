Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the workflow, open science methodology, and tools used for processing big data, particularly in the context of vessel data and fishing activity analysis. It discusses data classification, spatio-temporal aggregation, and FAIR data principles, but it does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
