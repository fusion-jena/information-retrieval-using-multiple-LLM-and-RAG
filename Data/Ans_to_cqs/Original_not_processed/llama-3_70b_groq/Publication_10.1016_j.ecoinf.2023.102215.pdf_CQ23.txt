Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of dilated convolutions, nested encoder-decoder structures, and the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function. It also discusses the performance of the model on public datasets, but it does not provide information on how the model was evaluated or validated to ensure its generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
