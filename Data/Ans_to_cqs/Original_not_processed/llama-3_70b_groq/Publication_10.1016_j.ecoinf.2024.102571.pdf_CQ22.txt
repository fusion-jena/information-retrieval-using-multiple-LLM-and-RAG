Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is R2 (coefficient of determination). This is mentioned in the context as "The GHGdwts predictions showed the ANN model was accurate with R2 = ...". This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated based on how well it predicts the GHGdwts output, and R2 is being used as a measure of that accuracy. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, or accuracy in the provided context.
