Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are as follows:

For the Unet model:
- Initial learning rate: 0.01
- Optimizer: SGD
- Activation function: ReLu
- Loss function: Dice loss
- Number of iterations: 150
- Batch size: 4
- Downsampling multiplier: 8

For the Deeplabv3+ model:
- Initial learning rate: 0.0001
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation function: ReLu
- Loss function: Dice loss
- Number of iterations: 150
- Batch size: 2
