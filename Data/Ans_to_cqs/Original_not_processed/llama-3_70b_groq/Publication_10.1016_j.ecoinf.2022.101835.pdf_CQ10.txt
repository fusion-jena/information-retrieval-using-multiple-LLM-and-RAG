Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the libraries and frameworks used, such as TensorFlow, LightGBM, and Optuna, but does not provide a link to a specific repository where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
