Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline's code is available. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles discussing various topics such as object detection, laser scanning, and data collection, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
