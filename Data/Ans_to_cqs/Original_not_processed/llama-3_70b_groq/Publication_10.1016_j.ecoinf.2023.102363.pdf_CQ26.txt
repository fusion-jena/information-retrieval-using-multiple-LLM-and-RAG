Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "although training batches are equal across classes, the contributing frames to each training batch cannot be equal due to overrepresentation of ambient frames." This suggests that the data may be imbalanced, but it does not provide information on how this imbalance is addressed.

Additionally, the context mentions the bias-variance tradeoff (Neal et al., 2018) as a possible explanation for the variable results between batch sizes 100 and 300 across all performance metrics. This implies that the authors are aware of the potential issue of bias in their data, but it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address it.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
