Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. 

The context provided suggests that the model is designed to detect and identify objects in images, particularly in UAV thermal images. The model uses a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) as the backbone network to construct feature maps, which are then used to generate region proposals and ultimately detect objects in the images. The model also involves classification and bounding box regression to predict the presence and location of objects within the original images. This is a typical process of a two-stage object detector, as mentioned in the context.
