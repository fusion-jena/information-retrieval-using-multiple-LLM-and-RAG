Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the framework used to build the deep learning model is PyTorch. This is mentioned in the sentence: "the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with the COCO dataset." The "deeplab-pytorch-crf" part of the GitHub repository URL suggests that the implementation is based on PyTorch. There is no mention of TensorFlow or any other framework in the provided context.
