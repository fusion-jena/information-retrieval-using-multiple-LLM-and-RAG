Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) in a model, which is 500 trees in this case. This suggests that the authors may have used a grid search for hyperparameter tuning, but the specific optimization technique used is not mentioned.
