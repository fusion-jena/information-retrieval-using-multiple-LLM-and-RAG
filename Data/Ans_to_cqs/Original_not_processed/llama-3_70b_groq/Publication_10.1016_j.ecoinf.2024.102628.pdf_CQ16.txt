Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the cross-validation strategy, model performance evaluation, and confusion matrix, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for training. 

It is possible that the training process is completed after a fixed number of iterations or epochs, but this information is not provided in the given context. The context does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) between true and predicted values for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions, but it does not indicate when the training process is considered complete.
