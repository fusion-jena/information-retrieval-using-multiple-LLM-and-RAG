Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is DropoutLayer. This is evident from Tables 1 and 2, which describe the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN and clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, respectively. In both tables, a DropoutLayer is included in the architecture.

However, there is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may be used, but they are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that DropoutLayer is used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting, but there is no information about L2 regularization or other methods.
