Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, for object detection, and presents results and comparisons of these models. However, it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
