Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on clustering methods, such as the Distortion method and the Elbow method, and evaluation metrics like Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
