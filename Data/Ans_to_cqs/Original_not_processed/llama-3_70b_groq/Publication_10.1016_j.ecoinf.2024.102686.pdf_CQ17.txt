Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not discuss regularization techniques.

The context provides equations and explanations related to SOM, including the learning rate, neighborhood, and weight updates. It also mentions SVM and its limitations, such as training efficiency and boundary issues. However, it does not touch on regularization methods used in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
