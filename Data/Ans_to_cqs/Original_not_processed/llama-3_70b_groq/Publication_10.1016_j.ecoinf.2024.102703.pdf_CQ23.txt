Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it describes the development of a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b. The model was trained on 64 water samples and validated on the remaining samples. The validation accuracy was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI.

There is no mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The model was developed and validated on a specific dataset, and its applicability to other datasets or scenarios is not discussed.
