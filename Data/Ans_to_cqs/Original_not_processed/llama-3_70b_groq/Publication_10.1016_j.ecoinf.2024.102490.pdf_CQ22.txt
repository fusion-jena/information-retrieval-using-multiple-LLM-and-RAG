Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model. There is no mention of deep learning models in the provided context, so it seems that the model being referred to is a distribution model, not a deep learning model.
