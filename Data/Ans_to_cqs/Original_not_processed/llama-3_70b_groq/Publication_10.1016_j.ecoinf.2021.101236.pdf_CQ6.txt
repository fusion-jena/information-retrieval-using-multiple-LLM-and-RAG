Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the input is a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. This suggests that the input data has undergone some form of preprocessing to convert the audio data into a mel spectrogram representation.

Additionally, the context mentions a "pre-processing block" that transforms the original input spectrogram before it is passed through a series of residual stacks. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved in this block are not detailed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
