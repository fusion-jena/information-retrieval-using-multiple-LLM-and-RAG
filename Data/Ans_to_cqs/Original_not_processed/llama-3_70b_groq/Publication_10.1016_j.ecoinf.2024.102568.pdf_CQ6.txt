Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is scaling. Specifically, a MinMaxScaler is used to transform each feature by scaling it to a [0-1] range. This is mentioned in the context as part of the preprocessing of the training set. There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, cleaning, or feature selection.
