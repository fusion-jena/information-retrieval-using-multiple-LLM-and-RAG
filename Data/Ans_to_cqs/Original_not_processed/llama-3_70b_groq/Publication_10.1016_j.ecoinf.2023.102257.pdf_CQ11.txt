Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experiment, methods, and results of a study on the efficiency of machine learning (ML) model-assisted tagging, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
