Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to remote sensing data, specifically LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and Landsat imagery. There is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats. However, it can be inferred that the LiDAR data is in a point cloud format, as it is mentioned that the point cloud is cut out from the cylindrical plot design and then thinned to unify the cloud density.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat 8 data, which is a satellite imagery dataset. It is likely that the Landsat data is in a raster format, such as GeoTIFF or similar. There is no mention of CSV data format being used in the deep learning pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline, and it is possible that other data formats are used in the pipeline that are not mentioned in the provided context.
