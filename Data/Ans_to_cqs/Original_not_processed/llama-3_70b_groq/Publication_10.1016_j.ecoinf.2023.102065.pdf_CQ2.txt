Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio, specifically .wav files. The audio data is then converted into 2D image spectrograms, such as mel-spectrograms, which are used as input to the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
