Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that the algorithms use numerical 'features' extracted from the pictures, which represent attributes of the pictures. These features include 36 color features, 135 shape features, and 55 texture features extracted using Inovtaxon. There is no mention of annotation techniques used to prepare the data for the deep learning model.
