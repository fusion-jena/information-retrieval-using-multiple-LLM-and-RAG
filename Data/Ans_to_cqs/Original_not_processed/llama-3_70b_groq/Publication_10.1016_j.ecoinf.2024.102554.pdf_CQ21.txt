Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, or any other specific steps. The context appears to be related to environmental monitoring, data acquisition, and satellite instruments, but it does not provide information about machine learning model training or postprocessing.

The context mentions "operational intricacies of these tools" and a README.md file, but it does not elaborate on the specific tools or their usage in model training or postprocessing. The tables provided describe in situ monitoring and satellite instruments, but they do not relate to postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
