Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of deep learning methods, specifically Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), and compares its performance with traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). It does not provide information about the framework used to implement the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
