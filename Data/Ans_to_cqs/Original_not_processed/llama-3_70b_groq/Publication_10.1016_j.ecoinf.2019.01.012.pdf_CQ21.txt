Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The model accuracy and loss were calculated for both the training and validation sets. 

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix was prepared for each photograph individually to compare the classification results with the corresponding manual classification (reference data).

No mention of Saliency maps is found in the provided context. It is possible that this step might not be involved in the postprocessing steps of the model.

Additionally, the model's prediction error was assessed on the test set after the best model setup was found. The performance of the final model was tested on two different data sets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs.
