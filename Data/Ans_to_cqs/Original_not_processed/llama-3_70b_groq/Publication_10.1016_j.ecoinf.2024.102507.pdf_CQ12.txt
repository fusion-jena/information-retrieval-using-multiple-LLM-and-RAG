Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. This is explicitly mentioned in the context, specifically in section 3.2, which states "the CNN model in this study was further built using the following steps:". Additionally, the context also mentions the use of specific CNN architectures such as VGG19 and ResNet50.
