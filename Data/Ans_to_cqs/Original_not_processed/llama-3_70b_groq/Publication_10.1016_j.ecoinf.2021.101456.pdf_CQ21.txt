Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the model architecture, training, and performance evaluation. It discusses the selection of the number of clusters, exploring the latent space, and performance comparison, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
