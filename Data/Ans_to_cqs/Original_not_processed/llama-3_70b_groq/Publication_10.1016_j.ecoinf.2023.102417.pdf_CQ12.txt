Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention UNet and DeepLabV3, which are both convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures commonly used for semantic image segmentation tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses a CNN-based model, but the exact type is not specified.
