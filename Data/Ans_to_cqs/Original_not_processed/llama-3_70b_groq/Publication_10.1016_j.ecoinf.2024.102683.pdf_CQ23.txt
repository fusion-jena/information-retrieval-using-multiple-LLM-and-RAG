Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that data augmentation (DA) was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context states that "the remaining 20% was used to test the model and improve the generalization performance of the models." This suggests that the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the testing set being used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the proposed approach uses a five-fold cross-validation method, where the data is divided into five equal folds, and policies are applied to each fold without repetition. This cross-validation method helps to ensure that the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data, which can help to improve its generalizability.

There is no mention of stratified splitting or using a diverse dataset in the provided context. However, the use of data augmentation techniques and cross-validation methods suggest that efforts were made to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model.
