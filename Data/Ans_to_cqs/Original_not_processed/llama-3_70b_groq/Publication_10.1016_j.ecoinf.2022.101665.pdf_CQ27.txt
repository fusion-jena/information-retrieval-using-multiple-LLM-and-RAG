Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on machine learning, geostatistics, and evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by statistical prediction methods. It discusses data availability, resampling methods, and map accuracy metrics, but does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
