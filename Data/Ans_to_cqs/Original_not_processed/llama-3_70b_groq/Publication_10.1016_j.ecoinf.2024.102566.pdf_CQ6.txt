Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The text only discusses the importance of high-quality training samples and the use of a method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps taken before training a model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
