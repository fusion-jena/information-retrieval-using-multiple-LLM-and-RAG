Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and climate change, and it references various scientific papers and datasets. There is no mention of a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
