Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict GHGdwts (greenhouse gas emissions from domestic wastewater treatment) based on input factors such as population size and GDP. The model is a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, and it is trained to make accurate predictions of GHGdwts. The model is not used for classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather for regression analysis to estimate the output variable GHGdwts.
