Answer:::

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using machine learning techniques, specifically random forests. It discusses the advantages of random forests, such as handling large numbers of predictor variables and accommodating nonlinear relationships, as well as providing measures of variable importance.

There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is outside the scope of the provided information.
