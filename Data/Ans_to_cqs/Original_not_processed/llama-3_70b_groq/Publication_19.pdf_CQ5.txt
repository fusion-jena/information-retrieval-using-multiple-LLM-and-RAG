Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, according to the context, the dataset consists of 33,984 images taken during day and night with 6 animal classes, which is a custom dataset for animal classification in camera trap images. The models were pre-initialized with ImageNet weights, indicating that the authors used transfer learning from the ImageNet dataset, but the actual dataset used for training and testing is a custom dataset specific to the animal classification task.
