Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that passive acoustic monitoring is used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, sound recorders such as AudioMoth are used to collect sound recordings of bird vocalizations. These recordings are then used as input data for automated signal recognition software, such as BirdNET, which is a deep neural network that can identify over 3000 bird species.

It is also mentioned that external microphones can be connected to AudioMoth, which can potentially improve the detection range of bird vocalizations. Additionally, different signal settings, directional or parabolic microphones can be used to collect data.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that surveys may be used in traditional bird data censuses, as mentioned in the context, but this is not directly related to the deep learning pipeline.

Overall, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appears to be passive acoustic monitoring using sound recorders such as AudioMoth.
