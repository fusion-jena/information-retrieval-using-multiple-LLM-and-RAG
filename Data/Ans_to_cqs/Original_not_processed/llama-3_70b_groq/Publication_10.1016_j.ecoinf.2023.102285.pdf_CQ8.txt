Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are academic papers and articles, which typically do not include code repositories. The context discusses various research studies and techniques related to detecting underwater man-made objects, but it does not provide information about the availability of code repositories for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
