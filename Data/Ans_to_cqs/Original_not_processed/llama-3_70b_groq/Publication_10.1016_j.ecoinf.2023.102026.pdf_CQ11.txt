Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text appears to be a snippet from a research article in the journal Ecological Informatics, and it discusses species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids using generalized linear models and random forests. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
