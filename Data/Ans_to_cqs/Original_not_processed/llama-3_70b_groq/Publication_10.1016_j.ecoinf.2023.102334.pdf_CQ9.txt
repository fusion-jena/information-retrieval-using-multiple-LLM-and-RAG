Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of transformers in computer vision, specifically for identifying sika deer. It cites various references and provides some mathematical formulas, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
