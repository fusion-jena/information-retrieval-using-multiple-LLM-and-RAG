Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the development of a mobile-based application for agricultural pest recognition using Faster R-CNN and discusses the classification performance analysis, results, and comparative performance evaluation. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
