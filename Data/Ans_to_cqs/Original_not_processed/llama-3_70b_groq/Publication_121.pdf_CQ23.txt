Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset divided into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of transfer learning, which involves reusing previously attained knowledge in similar tasks. This approach can help improve the generalizability of the model by leveraging knowledge learned from a large dataset (in this case, ImageNet) and fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset.

Furthermore, the use of dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.2 can be seen as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, which can also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, it is not explicitly stated whether other measures such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to ensure the model's generalizability.
