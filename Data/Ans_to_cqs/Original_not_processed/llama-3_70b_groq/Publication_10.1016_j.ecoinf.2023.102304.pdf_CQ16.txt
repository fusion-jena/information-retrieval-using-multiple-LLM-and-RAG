Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing a specific model or algorithm for detecting wildfires, and the parameters and evaluation metrics used in that context. There is no mention of training completion criteria, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
