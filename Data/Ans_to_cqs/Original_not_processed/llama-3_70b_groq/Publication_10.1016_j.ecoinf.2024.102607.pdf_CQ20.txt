Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various techniques for addressing the problem of unbalanced training data in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of oversampling and undersampling. It also mentions the use of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping. Additionally, it references various studies and papers related to LULC mapping, but does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
