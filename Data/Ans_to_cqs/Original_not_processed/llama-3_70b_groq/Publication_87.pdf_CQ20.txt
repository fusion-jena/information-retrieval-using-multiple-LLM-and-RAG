Answer:::
Answer: The context mentions that the training process took approximately 75 minutes per epoch on a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64Go memory, and less than half an hour on a machine with a GPU. This implies that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are CPUs (on the Mac) and GPUs (on the other machine). There is no mention of TPUs.
