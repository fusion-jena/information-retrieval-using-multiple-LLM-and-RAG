Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the methodology used for data gathering, pre-processing, and training the U-Net, as well as the results achieved with different approaches. However, it does not specify the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
