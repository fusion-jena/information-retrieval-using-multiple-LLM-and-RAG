Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on bagging, bootstrap sampling, and spatial autocorrelation in the context of geospatial modeling and machine learning. It discusses how to address issues of biased model training and validation when dealing with spatially clustered data.

However, it does mention bootstrapping and bagging, which involve random sampling of data points to create multiple models and ensemble predictors. In this context, the probability of selecting a data point is 1/n, where n is the number of data points. This implies that randomness is inherently present in the bagging process, but the context does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
