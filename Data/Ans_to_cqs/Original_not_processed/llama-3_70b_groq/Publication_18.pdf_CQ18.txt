Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various topics such as image classification, object detection, and whale counting using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

However, it is common in deep learning to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and loss to monitor the model performance during training. These metrics are often calculated and displayed after each epoch or a set of epochs to track the model's progress. Additionally, techniques like validation curves and learning curves can be used to monitor the model's performance and identify issues like overfitting or underfitting.

In the provided context, Table 3 mentions an "Accuracy indicator, equation, and interpretation of the performance assessment," but it does not provide further details on how the model performance is monitored during training.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
