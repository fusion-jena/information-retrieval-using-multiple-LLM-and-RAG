Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). It also mentions the use of random forest algorithm in the LEAS module, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques.
