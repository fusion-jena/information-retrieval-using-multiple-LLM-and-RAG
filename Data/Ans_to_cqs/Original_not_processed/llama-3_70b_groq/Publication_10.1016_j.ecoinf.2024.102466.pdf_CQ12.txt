Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are primarily variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The models mentioned, such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster RCNN, ATSS, RetinaNet, and RepPoints, are all object detection models that utilize CNNs as their backbone architecture. These models are designed for image-based object detection tasks, which is consistent with the application of bird detection in camera trap images. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context, suggesting that they are not used in this particular pipeline.
