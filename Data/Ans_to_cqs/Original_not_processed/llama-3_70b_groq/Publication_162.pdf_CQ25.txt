Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for fine-grained visual categorization, which involves classifying images of moths into their respective species. The model, a ResNet-50 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet, is trained on cropped bounding box images of detected moths and achieves an average accuracy of 89.00% on a held-out test set. The model is also used to classify additional images obtained from internet image search engines, which are used to augment the training dataset.
