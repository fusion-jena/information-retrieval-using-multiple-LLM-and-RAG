Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that 80% of the data was used to train ensemble models, while the remaining 20% was used to validate each model to obtain individual optimized model hyperparameters.

This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for validation. There is no mention of a test set, which is typically used to evaluate the performance of a model after it has been trained and validated.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide specific information on how the data was split, such as whether it was done randomly or using a specific strategy. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
