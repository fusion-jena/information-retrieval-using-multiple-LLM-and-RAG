Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, ecology, and environmental studies, with some mentions of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their applications. 

However, it is implied that the quality and quantity of the sample dataset are crucial for the accuracy of ANN models (Yang et al., 2018). This suggests that handling randomness in the dataset might be important, but the context does not provide specific strategies for doing so.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as setting a fixed random seed, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and employing ensemble methods. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
