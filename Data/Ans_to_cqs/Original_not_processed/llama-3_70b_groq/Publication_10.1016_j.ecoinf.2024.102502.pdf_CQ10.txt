Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research article or paper discussing the use of remote sensing and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for ecological research, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
