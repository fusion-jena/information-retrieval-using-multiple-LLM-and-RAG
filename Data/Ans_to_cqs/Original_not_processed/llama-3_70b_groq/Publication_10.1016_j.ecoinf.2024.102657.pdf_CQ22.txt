Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data and raw data was compared, and the accuracy levels were similar. Specifically, the accuracy on filtered data averaged to 99.22%, and the accuracy on non-filtered data averaged to 99.25%. 

This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, we can conclude that accuracy is one of the metrics used, but the context does not provide information on other metrics.
