Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does mention "hyperparameter optimization using Bayes algorithm" in one of the references (Sun et al., 2020), but it does not provide a general answer to the question. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
