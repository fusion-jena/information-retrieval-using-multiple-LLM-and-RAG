Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that MegaDetector has been trained using hundreds of thousands of images labeled by manual human review from a wide variety of ecosystems. This suggests that the dataset used to train MegaDetector is a custom dataset specific to wildlife camera trap images, rather than a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
