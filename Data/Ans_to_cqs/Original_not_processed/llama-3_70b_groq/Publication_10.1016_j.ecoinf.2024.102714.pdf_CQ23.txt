Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does discuss the use of an XGBoostClassifier, which is a type of machine learning model. To ensure the generalizability of the XGBoostClassifier, the following measures were taken:

1. **Splitting polygons rather than pixels**: This was done to minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.

2. **Stratified splitting**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the context implies the use of stratified splitting. The polygons were split into calibration and validation sets, with ~30% of pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation.

3. **Diverse dataset**: The dataset was generated through reference to existing field datasets and VHR images, which suggests that the dataset is diverse and representative of different habitats.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, which is an important technique to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether cross-validation was used in this study.
