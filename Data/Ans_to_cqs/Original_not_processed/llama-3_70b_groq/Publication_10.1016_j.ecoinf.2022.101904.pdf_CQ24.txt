Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of 3D GAN and Swin Transformer for wetland mapping, and the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer model. It discusses the challenges of imbalanced data and limited ground-truth data, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
