Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the deep learning part is implemented with the Python library PyTorch, but it does not provide further details about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
