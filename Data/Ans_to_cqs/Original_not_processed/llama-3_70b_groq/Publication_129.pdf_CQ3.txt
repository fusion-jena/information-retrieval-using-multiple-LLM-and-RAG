Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on explaining the Faster R-CNN approach and its components, such as the Region Proposal Network (RPN), feature extractor network, and Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer. It also mentions the loss function and IoU calculation, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation might be used, as the Faster R-CNN approach is used for object detection, which typically involves annotating objects with bounding boxes. But this is only an inference, and the context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
