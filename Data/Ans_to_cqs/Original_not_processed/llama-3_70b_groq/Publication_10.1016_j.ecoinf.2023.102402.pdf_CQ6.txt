Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps involved in training such models. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche overlap, and model validation using metrics such as AUC and TSS. There is no mention of preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically associated with deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
