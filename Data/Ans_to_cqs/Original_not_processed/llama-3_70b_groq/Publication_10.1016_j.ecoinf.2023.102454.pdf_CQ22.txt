Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics. The text discusses the estimation of carbon emissions using nighttime lighting data and provincial statistical energy data, and it mentions the evaluation of the accuracy of urban carbon emission estimates by comparing the errors between the fitted values and the statistical values of carbon emissions. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
