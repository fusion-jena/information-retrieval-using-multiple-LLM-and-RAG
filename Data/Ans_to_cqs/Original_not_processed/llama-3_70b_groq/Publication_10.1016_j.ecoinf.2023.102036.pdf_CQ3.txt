Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in fisheries, image classification, and computer vision, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of image data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets. This is mentioned in the paper "A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning" by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019). 

In the absence of specific information on data annotation techniques, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
