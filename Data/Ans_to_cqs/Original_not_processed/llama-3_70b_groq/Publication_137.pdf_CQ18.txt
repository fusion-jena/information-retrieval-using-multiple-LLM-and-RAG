Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the experimental results, parameter adjustments, and their effects on the model's performance, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as overall accuracy (OA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU), as these metrics are mentioned in the context. But the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training is not mentioned.
