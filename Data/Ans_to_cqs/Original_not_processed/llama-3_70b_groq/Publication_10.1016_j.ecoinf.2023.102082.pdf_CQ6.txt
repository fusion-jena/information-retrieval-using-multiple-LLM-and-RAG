Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the creation of a high-resolution CHM of the Earth using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach, as well as the use of GEDI CHMs to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems. It does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that may have been performed before training the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
