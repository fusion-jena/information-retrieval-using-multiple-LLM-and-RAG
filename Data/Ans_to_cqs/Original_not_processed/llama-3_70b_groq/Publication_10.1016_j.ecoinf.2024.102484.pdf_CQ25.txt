Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The only mention of deep learning is in the first reference, "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" (Huang et al., 2019). However, it does not specify the purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
