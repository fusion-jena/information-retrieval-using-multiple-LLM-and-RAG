Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link or any information related to a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a series of numerical values and some text related to ecological informatics, but it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
