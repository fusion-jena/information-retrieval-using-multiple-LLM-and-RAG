Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. The text mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development, but it does not specify when training is considered complete.

There is no mention of a validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria being used to determine the completion of training. The focus of the text is on the methodology used for machine learning training, including the use of nested k-fold cross-validation and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this study.
