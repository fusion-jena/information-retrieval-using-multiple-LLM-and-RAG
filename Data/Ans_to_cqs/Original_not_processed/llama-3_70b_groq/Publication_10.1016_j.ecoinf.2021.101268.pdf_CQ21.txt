Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after model training are:

1. Confusion matrices: The context mentions Fig. 5, which shows the confusion matrices for the VGG-19 architecture. This suggests that confusion matrices are calculated as a post-processing step to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Saliency maps: The context mentions the use of Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017) and SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017) methods to plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the input space relevance. This implies that saliency maps are generated as a post-processing step to visualize feature importance.

3. Metrics calculation: The context provides tables (Table 4 and Table 5) that show the accuracy of the models with and without pre-processing. This suggests that metrics such as accuracy are calculated as a post-processing step to evaluate the model's performance.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention other post-processing steps, such as model interpretation techniques like SHAP values or LIME. Therefore, it is unclear if these steps are involved in the post-processing pipeline.
