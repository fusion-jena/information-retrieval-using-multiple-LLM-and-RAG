Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of the PlantClef2015 dataset, the analysis of filter responses in convolutional layers, and the visualization of feature maps. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it is mentioned that the authors "pre-train each network using its corresponding leaf data" and "combine both softmax outputs and compute the final class scores using fusion methods: average (ave) or max voting (mav)" during the validation phase. This suggests that some form of data fusion or ensemble method is used, but it is not clear if this is specifically intended to improve generalizability.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
