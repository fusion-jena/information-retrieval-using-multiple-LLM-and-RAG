Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is multi-temporal forecasting of daily streamflow (Qflow). The model is designed to predict the daily streamflow values based on the input predictors. The model's architecture and hyperparameters are tuned for regression tasks, as evidenced by the use of metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate its performance. The model is not intended for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks, but rather for predicting continuous values of streamflow.
