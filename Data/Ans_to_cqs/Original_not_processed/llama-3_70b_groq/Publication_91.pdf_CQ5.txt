Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset consisting of 426,876 images of pollen grains, covering 35 species, with 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels. This dataset is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a specific dataset collected for the purpose of this study on pollen species identification.
