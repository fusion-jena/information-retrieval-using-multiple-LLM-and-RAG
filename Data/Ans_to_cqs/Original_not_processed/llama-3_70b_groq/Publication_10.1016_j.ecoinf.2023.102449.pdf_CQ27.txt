Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture and design of the soundscape VAE, including the encoder and decoder, residual networks, and the pre-processing block. It also explains the use of batch normalization, wide residual networks, and the activation function used. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
