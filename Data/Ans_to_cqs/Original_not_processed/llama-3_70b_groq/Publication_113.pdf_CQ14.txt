Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Tuning hyperparameters is likely to improve results" and that "we used well-known values of hyperparameters to train our models." This suggests that the hyperparameters were not optimized using methods such as grid search or random search, but rather default or commonly used values were employed. However, it does not provide further information on the optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
