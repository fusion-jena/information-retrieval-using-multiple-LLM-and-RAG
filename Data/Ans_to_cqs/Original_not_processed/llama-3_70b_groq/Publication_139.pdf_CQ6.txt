Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture selection, training, and validation of the model, as well as the generation of prediction records and collection of weather data. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
