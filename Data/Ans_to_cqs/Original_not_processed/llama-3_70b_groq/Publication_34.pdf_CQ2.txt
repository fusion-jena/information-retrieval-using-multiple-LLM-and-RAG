Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the description of the CNN architecture, it can be inferred that the input data is likely in the form of 2D or 3D arrays, similar to images. This is because CNNs are typically used for image classification tasks and are designed to efficiently process spatially auto-correlated data.

Additionally, the notation used in the context, such as X Md,d,p, suggests that the input data is in the form of arrays or matrices. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned either.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely in the form of 2D or 3D arrays, similar to images. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact data format used.
