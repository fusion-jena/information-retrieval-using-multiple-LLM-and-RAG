Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The "Data availability" section of the article only mentions that "Data and code are available as supplementary material to the article", but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
