Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. The only link mentioned is a DOI link to supplementary data, but it is not related to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, there is no mention of a specific platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the code might be hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
