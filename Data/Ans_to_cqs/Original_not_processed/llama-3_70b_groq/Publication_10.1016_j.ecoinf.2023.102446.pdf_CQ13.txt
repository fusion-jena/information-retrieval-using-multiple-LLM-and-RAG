Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The text appears to be discussing a method for generating process networks using information theory-based approaches, specifically transfer entropy, and mentions parameters such as the number of surrogates, significance level, and lagged information. There is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
