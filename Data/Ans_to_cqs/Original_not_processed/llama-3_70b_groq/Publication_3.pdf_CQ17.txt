Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of species identification. It discusses the architecture of CNNs, the use of TensorFlow, and the results of classification challenges, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
