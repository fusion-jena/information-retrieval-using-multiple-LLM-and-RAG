Answer: 

According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the early stopping technique. This technique is used to avoid overfitting by stopping the model training when the desired level of accuracy is reached. The number of iterations required until convergence is used as a stopping criterion, which was 120 for the CS model and 106 for the NW model. There is no mention of validation loss plateau as a criterion to determine when training is complete.
