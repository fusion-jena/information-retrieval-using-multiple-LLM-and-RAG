Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training hyper-parameters, model architectures, and performance evaluation of different models on the IP102 dataset. It also explains the concept of transformer-like and MLP-like models, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
