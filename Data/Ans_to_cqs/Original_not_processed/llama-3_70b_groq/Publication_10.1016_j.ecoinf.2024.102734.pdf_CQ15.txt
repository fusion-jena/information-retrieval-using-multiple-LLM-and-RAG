Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on semi-supervised learning techniques, active learning, and feature extraction model selection. It discusses the use of transductive propagation, active learning, and recommender systems, but does not provide information about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
