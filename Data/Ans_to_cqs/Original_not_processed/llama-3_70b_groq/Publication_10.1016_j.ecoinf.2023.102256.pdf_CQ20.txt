Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the baseline model, the methods explored to incorporate contextual information, and the number of network parameters, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. The references cited are related to TensorFlow and other machine learning concepts, but they do not mention the specific hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
