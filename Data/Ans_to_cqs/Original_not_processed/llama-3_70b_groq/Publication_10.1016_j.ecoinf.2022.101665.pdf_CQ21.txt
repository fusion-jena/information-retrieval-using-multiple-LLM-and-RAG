Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are related to map evaluation and accuracy assessment. Specifically, the context mentions that "after which the means were computed from the sampling distributions" and "map accuracy metrics were computed" (Section 2.3). This suggests that the postprocessing steps may involve calculating various metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the thematic map produced by the calibrated statistical prediction method.

However, the context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. It is possible that these steps may be relevant in other machine learning applications, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I can only infer that the postprocessing steps may involve calculating map accuracy metrics, but the specific details are not provided. If you are looking for information on Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, I don't know the answer based on the provided context.
