Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context only mentions the use of deep learning models, specifically LSTM, for predicting air quality and particulate matter concentrations, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
