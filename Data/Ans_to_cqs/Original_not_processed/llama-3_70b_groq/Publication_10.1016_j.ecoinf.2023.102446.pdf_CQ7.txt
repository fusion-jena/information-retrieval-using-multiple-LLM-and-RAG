Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on environmental variables such as respiration, solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation, and it discusses the data collection and processing methods, as well as the methodology used for the study. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of a deep learning model.
