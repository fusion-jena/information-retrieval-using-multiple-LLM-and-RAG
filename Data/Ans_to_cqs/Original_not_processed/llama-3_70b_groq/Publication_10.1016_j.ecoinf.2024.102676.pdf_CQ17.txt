Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context primarily discusses the missForest algorithm, a Random Forest-based approach for imputing missing values, and its application in the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT). It also mentions a study using deep learning models to classify otter species, but it does not provide information about the regularization methods used in that study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
