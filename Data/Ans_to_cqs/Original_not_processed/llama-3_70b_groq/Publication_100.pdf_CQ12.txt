Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the model architecture in Fig. 5, which shows convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU activations, and grouped convolutions. The text also explicitly mentions the use of convolutional layers and the discrete convolution operator, which is a key component of CNNs.
