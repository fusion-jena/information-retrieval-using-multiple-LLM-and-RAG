Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, such as producer's accuracy and user's accuracy, which are calculated based on the confusion matrices. Additionally, the context mentions that the input of the training data was split into two sets, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing, to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on the testing set during training.
