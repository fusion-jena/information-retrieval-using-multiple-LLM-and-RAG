Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on classification models, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and discusses strategies to improve classification accuracy, including data augmentation, post-classification, and handling outliers. 

However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
