Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, land use changes, and vegetation dynamics, with discussions on models such as PLUS, FLUS, and references to various research papers. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
