Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. The context discusses the performance of various machine learning models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, but it does not mention deep learning models.

The context does mention the use of different models and their performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models. It is possible that the study used techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse datasets to ensure generalizability, but this information is not provided in the given context.
