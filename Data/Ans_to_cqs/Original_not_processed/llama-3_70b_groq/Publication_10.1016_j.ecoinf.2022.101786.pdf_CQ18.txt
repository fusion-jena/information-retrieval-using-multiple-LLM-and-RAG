Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a validation set. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated in cycles, with the model adjusting its node weights after each evaluation. The performance on the validation set is used to determine if the model is overfitting or not, and to select the optimal number of iterations for training. This is evident from the text, which states that "Throughout the training process, the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the training set - evaluating performance on the validation set – adjusting CNN node weights – before repeating the entire cycle." This approach allows the model to generalize well and avoid overfitting to the training data.
