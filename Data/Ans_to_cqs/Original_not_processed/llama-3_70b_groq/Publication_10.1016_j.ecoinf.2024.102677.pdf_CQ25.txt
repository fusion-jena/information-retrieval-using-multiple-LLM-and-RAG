Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for landscape type classification. The model is trained to predict the types of landscapes in the case study area. The model selection process involved fine-tuning several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, and evaluating their performances. The most effective model was selected to create the rural discriminant rules. The classification process involves multiple stages, and the model's performance is evaluated using validation and test sets.
