Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to ecological informatics and statistical modeling, but it does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques. The text discusses topics such as root trimmed mean squared prediction error, penalized loss functions, and estimation algorithms, but it does not mention common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
