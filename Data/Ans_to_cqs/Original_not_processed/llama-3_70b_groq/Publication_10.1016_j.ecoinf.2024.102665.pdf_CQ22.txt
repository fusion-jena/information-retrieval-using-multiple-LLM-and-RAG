Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context mentions a contingency table fit (CTF) as a network performance indicator, which represents the quality of the fit to the data, but it is not a typical metric used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. 

The CTF is a normalized measure from 0 to 100% that indicates how well the network represents the data, with 0% being the poorest fit and 100% being the best possible fit. However, this is not a standard metric used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

Typical metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. However, these metrics are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
