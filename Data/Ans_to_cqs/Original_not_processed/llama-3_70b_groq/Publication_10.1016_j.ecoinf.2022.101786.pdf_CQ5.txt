Answer: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. The testing dataset consisted of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect. This suggests that the datasets used are specific to the marine science domain and are not publicly available datasets. The context does not provide further information about the datasets, such as their size, composition, or characteristics.
