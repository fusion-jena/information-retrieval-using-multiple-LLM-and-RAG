Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the training process was performed for a number of iterations until the loss function reached its minimum value. This suggests that the training is considered complete when the loss function converges or reaches a minimum value, but the specific criteria for determining convergence (e.g., validation loss plateau, tolerance, or patience) are not specified.
