Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to bird audio detection and classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures. It also describes the architecture of a proposed model and its training parameters, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
