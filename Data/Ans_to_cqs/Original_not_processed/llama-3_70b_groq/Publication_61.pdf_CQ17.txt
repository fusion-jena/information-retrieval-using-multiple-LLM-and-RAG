Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the experimental setup, data augmentation, and the use of the Adam optimizer, but it does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the risk of overfitting when considering the option of making the CNN deeper. It suggests that instead of increasing the model capacity, a better approach would be to include more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions, to improve the accuracy.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
