Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The context discusses various deep learning architectures, such as VAE, CNN, VGG, AlexNet, ConvNet, and Resnet50, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
