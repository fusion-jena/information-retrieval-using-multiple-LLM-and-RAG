Answer:::

The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses various algorithms used for water quality prediction, including traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost) and their applications. It does not delve into data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning, which might imply that the researchers did not have sufficient data to address potential biases. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of handling outliers and extreme values in the data, which could be related to data bias. Nevertheless, it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
