Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture and training of the models, including the data augmentation techniques used, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
