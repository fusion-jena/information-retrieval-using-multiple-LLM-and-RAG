Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, with references to MODIS and Sentinel-2 datasets. There is no mention of traditional deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
