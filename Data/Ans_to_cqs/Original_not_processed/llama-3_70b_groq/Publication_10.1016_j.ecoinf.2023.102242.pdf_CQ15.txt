Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the classification method used, which involves filtering classification features to select the optimal feature combination and conducting object-oriented multi-level classification. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
