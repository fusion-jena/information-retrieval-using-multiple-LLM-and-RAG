Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only describes the architecture of the CNN model used for the binary classification problem, including the number of convolution and max pooling layers, the fully connected layer, and the input dimensionality. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used, such as grid search, random search, or any other method.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
