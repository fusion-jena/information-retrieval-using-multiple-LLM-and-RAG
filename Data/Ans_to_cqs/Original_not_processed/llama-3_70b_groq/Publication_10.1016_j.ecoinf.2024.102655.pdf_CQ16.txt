Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) using different datasets (full dataset and Best Training Subset - BTS) and their performance metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2) during training, validation, and testing steps. 

It does not provide information on the stopping criteria or convergence conditions used to determine when the training process should be stopped. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
