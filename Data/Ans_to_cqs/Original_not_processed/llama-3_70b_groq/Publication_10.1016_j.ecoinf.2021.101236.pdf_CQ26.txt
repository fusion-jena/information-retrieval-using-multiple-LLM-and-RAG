Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "diversify the training data" which suggests that the authors may have used diverse data collection to address data bias. 

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were used to address data bias. 

It is worth noting that the context focuses more on the model architecture and design, rather than data preprocessing and bias handling.
