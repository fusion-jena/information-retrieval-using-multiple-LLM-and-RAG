Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random grid search method. This is evident from the text, which mentions that the Python library's randint command is used to pick integers within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth, and the uniform command is used for discrete or continuous values inside a range, like the min_samples_split hyperparameter. This suggests that the hyperparameters are being tuned using a random search method, where multiple hyperparameter value ranges are examined to establish the model.
