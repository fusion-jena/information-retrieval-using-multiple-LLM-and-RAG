Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology and conservation biology, but it does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in various ecological studies, which implies that data preprocessing is an essential step in these studies. Nevertheless, the context does not provide explicit information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
