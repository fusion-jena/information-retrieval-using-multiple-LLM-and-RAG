Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention the concept of weighted random sampling in the context of evaluating the performance of regression CNNs. 

Additionally, the context suggests that using an ensemble of architectural similar or identical CNNs, with slight variations in the training process (e.g., shuffling the sequence of data or using different batch sizes), can produce more reliable predictions. This approach can help to mitigate the effects of randomness in the training process.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer based on the provided context.
