Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on song structures and vocalizations, with a table showing the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
