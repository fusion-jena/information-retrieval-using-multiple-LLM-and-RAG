Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the different deep learning backbone models used, such as Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet101, and MobileNetV2, but does not specify the framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
