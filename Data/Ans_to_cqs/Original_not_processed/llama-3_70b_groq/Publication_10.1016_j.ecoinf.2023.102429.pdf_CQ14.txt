Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values" but does not provide further details on the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query. It could be grid search, random search, or some other method, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific optimization method used.
