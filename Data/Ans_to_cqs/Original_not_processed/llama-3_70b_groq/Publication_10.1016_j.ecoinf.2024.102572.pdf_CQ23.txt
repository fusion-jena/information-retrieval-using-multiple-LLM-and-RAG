Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing the use of satellite data and machine learning techniques for land cover classification, fire severity assessment, and carbon emissions quantification, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
