Answer:::
Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially mentioned in the provided context. Specifically, the optimizer used for the model with the base model of MobileNetV2 is Adam optimizer, while the optimizer used for the model with the base model of MobileNetV3 is Gradient descent. Additionally, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 is used to reduce overfitting of the model. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
