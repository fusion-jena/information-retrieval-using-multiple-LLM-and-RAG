Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning models such as random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of HABs. It also explains the model development process, including data division, training, and hyperparameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
