Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the importance of image augmentations, such as flip, rotations, and affine transformation, to improve training performance. It also discusses the success of the deep learning model in segmenting and classifying objects with satisfying accuracy. However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
