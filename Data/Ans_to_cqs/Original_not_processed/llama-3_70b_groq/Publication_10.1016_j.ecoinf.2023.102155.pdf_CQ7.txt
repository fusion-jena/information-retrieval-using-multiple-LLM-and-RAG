Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses methods for predicting species distributions, including k-nearest neighbors (knn), k-means, and random forest algorithms, as well as bias correction and lasso regularization. There is no mention of deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
