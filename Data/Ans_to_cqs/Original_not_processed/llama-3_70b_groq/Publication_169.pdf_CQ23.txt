Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed CNN-LSTM model, its performance, and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. It does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or any techniques employed to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
