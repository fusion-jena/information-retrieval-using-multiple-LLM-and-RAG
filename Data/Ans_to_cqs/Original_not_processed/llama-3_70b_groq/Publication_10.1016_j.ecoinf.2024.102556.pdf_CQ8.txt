Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning and UAV technology for wildlife monitoring, but it does not include any references to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
