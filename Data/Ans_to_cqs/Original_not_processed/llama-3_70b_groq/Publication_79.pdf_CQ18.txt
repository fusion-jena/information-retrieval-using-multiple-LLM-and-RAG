Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping criterion, also known as "patience" in Keras. This means that if the validation accuracy does not increase after 50 epochs, the training process is halted. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not over-trained.
