Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that introduce randomness in the training process. These techniques include:

1. Random scale: increases the scale of the image by a factor picked randomly in [1 to 10%]
2. Random crop: crops the image edges by a margin in [0 to 10%]
3. Flip horizontally: randomly mirrors the image from left to right
4. Random brightness: multiplies the brightness of the image by a factor picked randomly in [0, 10]

These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and help the model generalize better. However, they do not provide a direct answer to the question about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This is not mentioned in the provided context, but it is a common strategy employed in deep learning pipelines.
