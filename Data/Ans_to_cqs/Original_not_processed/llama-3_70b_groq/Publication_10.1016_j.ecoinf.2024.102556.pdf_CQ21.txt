Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text focuses on the model training and optimization process, particularly for object detection in UAV-based monitoring of Procapra przewalskii. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors are concerned with improving the detection accuracy and model optimization. They mention that their subsequent work will focus on further optimizing the detection model and implementing migration learning during model training to further improve detection accuracy. Additionally, they plan to modify the FEN (Feature Extraction Network) to make it as lightweight as possible while guaranteeing accuracy, making it more adaptable to UAV platforms with limited computational resources.

While the context does not provide explicit information on postprocessing steps, it suggests that the authors are interested in evaluating and refining their model's performance. Therefore, it is likely that they would involve metrics calculation and possibly confusion matrix analysis to assess the model's performance. However, without further information, it is unclear whether saliency maps or other specific postprocessing steps are involved.
