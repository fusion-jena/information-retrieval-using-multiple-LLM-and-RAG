Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context discusses the methodology of fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it mentions the use of machine learning techniques, such as Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forests, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models.
