Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The table showing the MLP parameters and performance provides the values of the hyperparameters, but it does not explain how these values were determined. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
