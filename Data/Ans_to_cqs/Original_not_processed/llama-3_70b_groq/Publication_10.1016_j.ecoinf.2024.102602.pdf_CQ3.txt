Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the annotation tool saves annotations as XML files in PASCAL VOC format. This suggests that the annotation technique used might be bounding box annotation, as PASCAL VOC is a common format for object detection tasks that involves annotating objects with bounding boxes. However, it does not provide any information about instance segmentation or other annotation techniques. Therefore, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation might be used, but it is not explicitly confirmed, and other techniques cannot be ruled out.
