Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the AutoML procedure, which involves generating candidate models with random architectures and hyperparameters, training them on a small subset of data, and selecting the best-performing model. It also discusses the use of residual networks (ResNet) and other architectures for time series classification. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process.
