Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions the application of machine learning models, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameter optimization process. The references provided are related to water quality prediction using machine learning, but they do not explicitly discuss hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
