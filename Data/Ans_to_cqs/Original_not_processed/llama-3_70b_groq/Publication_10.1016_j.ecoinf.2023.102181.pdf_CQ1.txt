Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on machine learning models, spatial autocorrelation, and soil classification, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the data collection methods might involve surveys, sensors, and public datasets, but this is not explicitly stated. For example, the reference to "multibeam echosounder data" in Calvert et al. (2015) suggests that sensors might be used for data collection. Similarly, the reference to "environmental measurements" in the context implies that surveys or sensors might be used to collect data.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
