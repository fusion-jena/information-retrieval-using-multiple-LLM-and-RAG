Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning models are able to perform complex tasks with high performance, such as computer vision and natural language processing, as well as image and sound data classification. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline may involve image and sound data formats. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of time series data as predictors, which are typically stored in formats such as CSV or other tabular data formats. However, it does not provide explicit information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline may involve image, sound, and time series data formats, but the exact formats are not specified.
