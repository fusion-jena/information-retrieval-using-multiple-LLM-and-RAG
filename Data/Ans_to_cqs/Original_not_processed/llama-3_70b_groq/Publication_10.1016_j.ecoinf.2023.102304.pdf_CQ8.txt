Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of research papers and their corresponding information, such as authors, publication years, and methodologies. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context does not provide any information about where the code repository of a deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
