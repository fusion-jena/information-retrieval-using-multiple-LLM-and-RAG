Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two techniques used to overcome limitations in practice: Transfer learning and Data-augmentation.

Data-augmentation is mentioned as a technique to increase the volume of the training dataset artificially, which can help to some extent in addressing data bias. By applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, and different illumination conditions, data-augmentation can simulate the deformations that data could suffer in the real world. This can help to reduce the impact of bias in the dataset.

However, the context does not mention other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that Data-augmentation is mentioned as a technique that can help address data bias, but other techniques are not mentioned.
