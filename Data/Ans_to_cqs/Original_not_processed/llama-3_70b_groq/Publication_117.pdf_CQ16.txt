Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the use of transfer learning, the multipart loss function, and the weighting of the no-object component, but it does not specify how the training process is terminated. It only mentions that the counting of the 1,000 survey images took 2 hours using the same GPU as for the training, but this does not provide insight into the stopping criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
