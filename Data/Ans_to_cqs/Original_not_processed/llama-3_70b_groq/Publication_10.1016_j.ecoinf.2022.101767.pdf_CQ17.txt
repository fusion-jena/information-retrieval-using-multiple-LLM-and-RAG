Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. It appears to be related to a study on YouTube videos about wild birds, featuring information about video metadata, machine learning algorithms, and statistical analysis. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
