Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of covariance-weighted bagging, which is a type of ensemble learning method. 

To ensure the generalizability of the model, out-of-bag validation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model at simulated locations. This approach is useful for evaluating extrapolation capacity. However, it does not provide information on whether diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used. 

The context highlights the importance of addressing biased model validation caused by clustered sampling and mentions that spatial weighting approaches are under-developed for this purpose. It also suggests that spatial partitioning may be overly aggressive at penalizing the predictive capacity of the model, especially in cases of inconsistent, non-uniform, or partial clustering. 

In summary, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model are not explicitly stated, but out-of-bag validation was used to evaluate the model's performance.
