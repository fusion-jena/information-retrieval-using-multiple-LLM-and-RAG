Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used to automatically identify Chagas disease vectors, specifically triatomine bug species, from images taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. The model is trained to classify the images into different species, such as Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius, with the goal of strengthening entomological surveillance systems.
