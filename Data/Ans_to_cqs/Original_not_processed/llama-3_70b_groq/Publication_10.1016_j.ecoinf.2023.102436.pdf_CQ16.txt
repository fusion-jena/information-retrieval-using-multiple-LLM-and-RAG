Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training, validation loss, or any criteria for determining when training is complete. The context appears to be related to landscape design, restorative potential, and quantitative assessment of restorative quality, with references to research papers and equations for calculating scores and weights. There is no mention of machine learning or training processes, which are typically associated with concepts like validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
