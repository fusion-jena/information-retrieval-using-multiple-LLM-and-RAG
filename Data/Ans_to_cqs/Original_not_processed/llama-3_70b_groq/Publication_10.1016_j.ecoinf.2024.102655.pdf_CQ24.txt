Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on water quality prediction using machine learning models, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. It discusses various techniques, such as outlier detection, artificial data replacement, and feature selection using cluster analysis. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

That being said, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as weight initialization, dropout, and shuffling of training data. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, setting a random seed value is a common practice in the field to ensure reproducibility of results.
