Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based model. Specifically, a VGG style network is employed for feature learning, as mentioned in section D of the provided context. Additionally, another CNN-based model with a different architecture, called SubSpectralNet, is also used for classification.
