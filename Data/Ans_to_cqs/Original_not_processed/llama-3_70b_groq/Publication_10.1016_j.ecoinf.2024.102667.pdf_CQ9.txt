Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to ecological research, with references to papers on desertification, drought, and vegetation responses to climate change. It also includes figures showing spatial distributions of ecological engineering programs and NDVI in China. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where it might be stored. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
