Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. The context appears to be related to a research article about a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, and it provides references to other research articles on related topics such as fish detection, biomass estimation, and posture classification. However, it does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
