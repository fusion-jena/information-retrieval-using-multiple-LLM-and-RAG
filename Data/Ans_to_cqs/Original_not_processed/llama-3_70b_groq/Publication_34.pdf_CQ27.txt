Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the model training process, including the initialization of model parameters, the optimization algorithm used, and the evaluation metrics. It also discusses the selection of species for the dataset and the environmental data used. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
