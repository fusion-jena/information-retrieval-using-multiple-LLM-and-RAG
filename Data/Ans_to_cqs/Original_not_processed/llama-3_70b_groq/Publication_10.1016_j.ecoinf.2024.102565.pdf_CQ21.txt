Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the model fitting process, including hyperparameter determination and prediction using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). It also explains the research methods used, including K-fold cross-validation and stratified sampling. Additionally, it presents the results of the model evaluation, including metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, and MBE.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as the results of the evaluation metrics are presented. But, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps are involved or not.
