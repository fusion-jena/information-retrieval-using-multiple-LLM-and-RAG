Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to machine learning models for predicting soil classes, spatial sampling, and validation methods, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
