Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses the architectures of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
