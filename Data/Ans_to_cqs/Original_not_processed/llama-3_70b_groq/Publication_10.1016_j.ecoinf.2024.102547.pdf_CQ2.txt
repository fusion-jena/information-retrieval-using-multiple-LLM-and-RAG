Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be focused on functional data analysis (FDA) and dimension reduction techniques, specifically principal component analysis (PCA). The data formats mentioned in the context are related to environmental data, such as sea temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, and salinity, which are likely in a numerical or CSV format. Additionally, the context mentions acoustic data from scientific echosounders, which could be in a proprietary format or a format such as WAV for audio data. However, there is no mention of image or video data formats.
