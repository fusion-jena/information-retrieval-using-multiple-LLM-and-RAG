Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, specifically random forest, and their application in predicting algal-related parameters and handling uncertainty in the predictions.

However, it is mentioned that the prediction distributions stem from utilizing optimized models developed through randomized subsets of training data. This suggests that the authors are using some form of randomization or bootstrapping to generate multiple models and estimate the uncertainty in their predictions. 

But, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline or if a random seed value is used. Therefore, I don't know the specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
