Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that large amounts of labeled training data are required for deep learning and that nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class were available for training the CNN model. It does not provide details on how these labels were created or what type of annotation was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
