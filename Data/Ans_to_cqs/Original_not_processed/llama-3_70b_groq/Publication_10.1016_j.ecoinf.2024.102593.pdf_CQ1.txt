Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that digital recorders are set in the field to collect environmental sound data, which is then processed to identify target species. This suggests that sensors, specifically audio recorders, are used to collect raw data. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of datasets, such as the NIPS4Bplus dataset, which implies that public datasets might be utilized as well. However, it does not provide information on surveys being used for data collection. 

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors (audio recorders) and public datasets are likely used for collecting raw data, but there is no mention of surveys being used for this purpose.
