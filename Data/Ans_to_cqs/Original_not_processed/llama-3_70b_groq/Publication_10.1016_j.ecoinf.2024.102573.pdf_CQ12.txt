Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of convolutional networks in the context of bird species recognition. Specifically, it mentions that "training a convolutional network directly on the CQT was, by far, the best choice among the features." Additionally, it mentions the use of learnable frontends with 80 filters of length 512, which is reminiscent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, it can be inferred that CNNs are likely used in the pipeline, but the exact architecture is not specified.
