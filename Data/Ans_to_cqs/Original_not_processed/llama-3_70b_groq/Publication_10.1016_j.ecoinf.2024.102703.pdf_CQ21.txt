Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that metrics calculation, specifically R2 and RMSE, are part of the postprocessing steps. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix. 

It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
