Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The article discusses the development and testing of a deep learning approach for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, but it does not provide a link to a data repository where the pipeline is stored. The context only mentions the use of a self-developed open-source software called Waveman, but it does not provide a link to access the software or the data.
