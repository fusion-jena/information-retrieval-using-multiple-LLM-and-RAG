Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the publication of data, code, and trained machine learning models, as well as citations from various research papers. It also discusses the use of YOLOv6 and experiments with different hyperparameters and spatial resolutions, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
