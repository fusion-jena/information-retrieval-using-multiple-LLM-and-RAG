Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the performance of different CNN architectures, including ResNetV50, InceptionNetV3, and EfÔ¨ÅcientNetB0, and mentions that using large deep learning networks can lead to overfitting, but it does not specify the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

However, it can be inferred that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting, as they mention that using large networks requires more training data to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the text mentions that transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pre-trained weights and only training the output layers achieved a high F1-score, which may be a way to prevent overfitting by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and reducing the number of learnable parameters.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, but it suggests that the authors are aware of the issue and may have used techniques such as transfer learning to mitigate it.
