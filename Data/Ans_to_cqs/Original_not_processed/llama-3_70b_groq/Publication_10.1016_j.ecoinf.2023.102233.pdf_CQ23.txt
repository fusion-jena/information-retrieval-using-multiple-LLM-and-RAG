Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that a random selection approach was used to overcome class imbalance within the evaluation data, which was stratified across the model's predictions (logits). This approach reduced class imbalance within the evaluation data and allowed for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics. 

However, it is noted that this approach alters the distribution of data and prohibits evaluation metrics from being generalized to the unlabelled data. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of ensuring generalizability, but the context does not provide further information on specific measures taken to achieve this.
