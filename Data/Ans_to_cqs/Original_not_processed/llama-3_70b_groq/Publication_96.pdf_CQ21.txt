Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The context mentions that "an accuracy is generated for each algorithm applied" during the training step, which suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps. 

Additionally, the context provides two confusion matrices (Tables 1 and 2) that compare the estimated burned area with the reference data, which indicates that creating a confusion matrix is another postprocessing step. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps or not.
