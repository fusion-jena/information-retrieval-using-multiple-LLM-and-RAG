Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or using any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and hydrographs, discussing different scenarios and land use simulations. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
