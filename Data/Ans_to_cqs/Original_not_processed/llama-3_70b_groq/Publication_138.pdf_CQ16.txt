Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the experimental results, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, based on common practices in deep learning, it is likely that the training process is stopped when a certain condition is met, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: The training process stops when the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau.
2. Maximum number of epochs: The training process stops when a predetermined number of epochs is reached.
3. Convergence: The training process stops when the model converges, i.e., the loss function stops decreasing significantly.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific criteria used in this particular experiment.
