Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the architecture of the model, the dataset used, the hyperparameters, and the evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
