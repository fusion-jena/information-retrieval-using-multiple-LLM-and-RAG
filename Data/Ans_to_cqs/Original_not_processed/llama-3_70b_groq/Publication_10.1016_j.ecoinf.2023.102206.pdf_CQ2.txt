Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses various data formats, including:

* Audio data: Specifically, acoustic data is used to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows.
* Image data: Texture images are used for segmentation, and datasets such as Brodatz texture and Intel Berkeley dataset are mentioned.
* EEG signals: EEG signals are used for driver drowsiness estimation.
* CSV data: Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that CSV data might be used for regression tasks, such as housing datasets and synthetic datasets.

There is no mention of video data being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that other data formats might be used, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
