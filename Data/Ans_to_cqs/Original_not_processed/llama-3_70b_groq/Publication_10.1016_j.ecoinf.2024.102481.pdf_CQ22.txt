Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº), Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Prevalence. These metrics are calculated using the confusion matrix, which includes true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). The formulas for each metric are provided in the context. Specifically, Precision measures the proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity measures the true positive rate, Specificity measures the true negative rate, and Prevalence measures the proportion within each phase.
