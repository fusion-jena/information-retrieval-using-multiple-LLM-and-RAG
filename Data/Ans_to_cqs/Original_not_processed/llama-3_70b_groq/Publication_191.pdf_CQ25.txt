Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for plant species identification. The model is trained to learn features from leaf images and classify them into different plant species. This is evident from the discussion on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for species identification and the comparison of different models' performance on classification tasks. The table provided also shows the accuracy of different models on a classification task, further supporting the purpose of classification.
