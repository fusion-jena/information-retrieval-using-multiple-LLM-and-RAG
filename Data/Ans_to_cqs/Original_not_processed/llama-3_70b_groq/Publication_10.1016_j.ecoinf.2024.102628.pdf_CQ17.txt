Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the classification problem, the use of the fast.ai platform, and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
