Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the performance of object detection models are precision, recall, and mAP (mean average precision). 

Precision provides information about the projected segment's accuracy. Recall measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances of a particular class. mAP (mean average precision) is the measure of choice for object detection algorithms, which is computed by considering various intersections over union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% and is denoted as mAP50â€“95. 

Additionally, other performance metrics mentioned in the context include accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), R2, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different models, such as YOLOv4, J48, CNN, Deep Belief Network, Linear Regression, Regression, and Partial Least Square.
