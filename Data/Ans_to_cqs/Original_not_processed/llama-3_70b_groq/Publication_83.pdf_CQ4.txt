Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses two methods for dealing with multi-variate varying length audio data: repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2s, and directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size. It does not mention any other data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
