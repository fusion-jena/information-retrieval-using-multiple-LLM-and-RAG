Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on random forests, hyperparameters, and tuning strategies, as well as applications of remote sensing and machine learning in grassland management and conservation.

However, it is worth noting that the paper by Probst, Wright, and Boulesteix (2019) discusses hyperparameters and tuning strategies for random forests, which may be related to handling randomness in machine learning models. Additionally, the paper by Breiman (2001) introduces the concept of random forests, which involves randomness in the selection of features and samples.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting.
3. Implementing regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent model complexity.
4. Using ensemble methods, like bagging and boosting, to combine multiple models and reduce variability.

However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
