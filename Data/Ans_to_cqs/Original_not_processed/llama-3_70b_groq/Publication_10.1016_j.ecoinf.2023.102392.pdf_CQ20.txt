Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover classification and forest type classification using XGBoost, and it discusses the methodology, results, and accuracy of the model. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware components.
