Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the workflow uses vessel tracking data, which can be provided by the user in CSV format or obtained from the Global Fishing Watch dataset.

The Global Fishing Watch dataset is a free-to-use dataset that provides daily vessel tracking data at 0.1Â° resolution between 2012 and 2016. The dataset has already classified fishing activity using a machine learning model, which allows the workflow to skip the fishing activity classifier step.

It can be inferred that the raw data collection methods used in this context are likely to be related to vessel tracking, possibly through sensors or other automated systems. However, the exact methods used for collecting this data are not specified in the provided context.

In summary, the context suggests that the raw data is collected through vessel tracking, but the specific methods used for collecting this data (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets) are not explicitly mentioned.
