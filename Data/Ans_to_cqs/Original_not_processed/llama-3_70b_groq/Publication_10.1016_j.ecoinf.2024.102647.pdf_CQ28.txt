Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on soil salinity distribution mapping using a deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
