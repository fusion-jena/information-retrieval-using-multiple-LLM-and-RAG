Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including Model-2, Model-K, and Count-ception, on the SSL and elephants' datasets. The RMSE and MAE scores are reported in Table 2, which shows the performance comparison of the different models.
