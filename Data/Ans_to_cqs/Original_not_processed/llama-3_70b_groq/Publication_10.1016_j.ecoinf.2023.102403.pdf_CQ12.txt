Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or a pipeline that uses such a model. The context appears to be related to biodiversity, ecology, and spatial data analysis, with references to R packages, scientific articles, and data integration. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
