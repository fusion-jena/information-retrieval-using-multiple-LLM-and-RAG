Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is being used, as the context mentions "remote sensing sequence of data", "Sentinel-2 time series", and "hyperspectral data". This suggests that sensors, such as satellite or airborne sensors, are being used to collect the raw data. Additionally, the context mentions "lidar and RGB data", which implies that sensors such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and RGB cameras are also being used. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are being used.
