Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses classification schemes, manual classification methods, and the potential use of machine learning tools, but it does not delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias.

The context focuses on the challenges of working with historical imagery and the limitations of machine learning methods when dealing with variable image quality. It highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in the analysis and the need for further testing and development of methods to incorporate uncertainty into the final results.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not addressed in the provided context.
