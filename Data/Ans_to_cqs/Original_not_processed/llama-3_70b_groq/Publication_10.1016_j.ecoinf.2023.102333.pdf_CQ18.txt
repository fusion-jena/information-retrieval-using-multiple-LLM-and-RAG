Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of learning and loss curves. The training accuracy curve provides insight into how the model is learning, while the validation accuracy curve gives insight into the generalizing process. The training loss curve shows the model's performance on the training data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The validation loss curve measures the model's performance on new unseen data. By analyzing these curves, the model's performance can be diagnosed, and issues such as overfitting can be identified.
