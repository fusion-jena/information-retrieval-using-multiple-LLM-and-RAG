Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite calls, but it does not provide details on model deployment.

The context mentions that the CNN model was trained on covey call spectrogram data and was used to analyze recordings, but it does not discuss how the model was serialized, selected, or deployed on a platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
