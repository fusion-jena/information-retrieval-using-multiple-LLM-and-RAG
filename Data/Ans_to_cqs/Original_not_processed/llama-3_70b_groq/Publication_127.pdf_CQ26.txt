Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention splitting the dataset into training and test sets, but it does not specify whether stratified splitting was used.

It is also mentioned that the dataset was created by randomly selecting 757,000 non-empty images and 757,000 empty images, which could be a form of oversampling or undersampling, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the purpose of this sampling.

There is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
