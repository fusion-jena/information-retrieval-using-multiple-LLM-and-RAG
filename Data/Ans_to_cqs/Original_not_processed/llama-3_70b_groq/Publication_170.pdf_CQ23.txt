Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, specifically the BMXSM dataset, which suggests that the model was exposed to a variety of images. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on different training sets (Traini, i = 1, 2, â€¦, 7) and evaluated on different subsets of the data, which could be indicative of some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, the exact methodology used is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of incremental training mode and zero-start training mode, which could be related to the model's generalizability, but the exact impact of these methods is not clear.

In summary, while the context suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset and evaluated on different subsets of the data, the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability are not explicitly stated.
