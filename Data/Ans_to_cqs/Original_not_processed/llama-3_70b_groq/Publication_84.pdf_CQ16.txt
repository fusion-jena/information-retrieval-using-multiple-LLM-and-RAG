Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the parameter setting and classification performance assessment of the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

However, it can be inferred that the optimal number of iterations in SAE is determined by estimating the mean error and number of misclassified points, as shown in Fig. 6. The figure suggests that the optimal number of iterations is chosen based on the lowest mean error and number of misclassified points.

Additionally, the context does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, early stopping, or a specific number of epochs. Therefore, it is unclear what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, and it is unclear what stopping criteria are used in this study.
