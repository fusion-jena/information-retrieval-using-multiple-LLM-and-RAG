Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically DeepLabV3+, is segmentation. This can be inferred from the context, which mentions "land cover model" and "training a model with DeepLabV3+" for a specific dataset. Additionally, the architecture of DeepLabV3+ is originally designed for image segmentation tasks, as shown in Figure 4. The model is fine-tuned for the land cover classification task, which involves segmenting images into different land cover classes.
