Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the application of deep neural networks in ecological prediction, particularly in the context of forest disturbance, and provides references to relevant research papers and datasets. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
