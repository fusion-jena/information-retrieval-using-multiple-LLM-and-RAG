Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper or article in the field of ecological informatics, and it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The references cited are mostly academic papers and do not include any links to code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository of a deep learning pipeline is available.
