Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the performance evaluation metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are average precision and recall, specifically mean average precision (mAP). The precision refers to the ratio of correctly classified positive samples (True Positive) to the total number of classified positive samples (either incorrectly or correctly). The recall rate refers to the ratio between the number of positive samples (True Positive) correctly classified as Positive to the total number of Positive samples. 

The formulas for precision and recall are:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

where TP is the number of True Positives, FP is the number of False Positives, and FN is the number of False Negatives.
