Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of MATLAB 2020b with various toolboxes, the ResNet-50 model, and the training parameters and settings used for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide information about where the code is hosted or made available. Therefore, I cannot determine the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
