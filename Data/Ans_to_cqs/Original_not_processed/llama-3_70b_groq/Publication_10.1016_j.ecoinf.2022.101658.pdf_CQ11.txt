Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and results of the study, including the use of Transfer Learning and the Deeplabv3-ResNet101 model, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to the data repository.
