Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different models, including ResNet, AST, and HuBERT, for audio classification tasks. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, feature extraction, and fine-tuning, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
