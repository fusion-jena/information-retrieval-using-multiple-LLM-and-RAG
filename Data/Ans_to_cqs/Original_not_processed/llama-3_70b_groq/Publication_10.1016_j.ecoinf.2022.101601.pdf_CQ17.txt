Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing thaw depths and moisture in the context of permafrost or soil science, and does not relate to deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
