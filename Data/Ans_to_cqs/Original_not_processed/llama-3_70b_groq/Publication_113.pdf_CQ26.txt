Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on active learning strategies, dimensionality reduction, and the application of deep neural networks. It does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of active learning strategies, such as margin-based active learning, to select the most informative unlabelled samples to be passed to the oracle for labelling. This approach can help to mitigate data bias by actively selecting samples that are most representative of the underlying data distribution.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a large-scale dataset, such as the NACTI dataset, which may imply that the authors are attempting to collect diverse data to reduce bias. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the context does not provide further information on data preprocessing techniques.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it is unclear what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
