Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention "environmental cross-validation" with ten folds, which is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. 

In environmental cross-validation, the data is typically split into folds, and each fold is used as a test set while the remaining folds are used as a training set. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average performance across all folds is used to evaluate the model.

However, the context does not provide specific information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation in the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
