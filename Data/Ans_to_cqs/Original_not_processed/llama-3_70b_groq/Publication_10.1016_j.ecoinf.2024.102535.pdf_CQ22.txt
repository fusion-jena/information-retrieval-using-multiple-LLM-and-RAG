Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models are F1-scores, which are computed for each individual class. The F1-score is expressed as the harmonic mean of Precision (Pc) and Recall (Rc). 

Specifically, the F1-score is calculated as:

F1 (cid:0) scorec = 2 × Pc × Rc / (Pc + Rc)

where Pc (Precision) is calculated as tp / (tp + fp), and Rc (Recall) is calculated as tp / (tp + fn). 

In these equations, tp represents the number of images correctly assigned to the class c (true positives), fp represents the number of images erroneously classified as the current class c (false positives), and fn corresponds to the number of images incorrectly classified as non-class c (false negatives).
