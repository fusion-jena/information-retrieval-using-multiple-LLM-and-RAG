Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some classic hyper-parameters used for a fast convergence of the network without over-fitting, including a random Gaussian initialization for weight initialization. This suggests that the model uses random initialization for its weights, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in other parts of the pipeline.

Additionally, the context does not mention any specific strategy for setting a random seed value, which is often used to ensure reproducibility of results in deep learning experiments. Therefore, it is unclear how randomness is handled in this specific pipeline.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as setting a random seed value, using dropout layers, and applying data augmentation techniques to handle randomness and improve model robustness. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine whether these strategies are employed in this specific pipeline.
