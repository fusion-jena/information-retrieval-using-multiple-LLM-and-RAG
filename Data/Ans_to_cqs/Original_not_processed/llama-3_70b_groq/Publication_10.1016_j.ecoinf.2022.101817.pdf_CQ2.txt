Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. This is because the context mentions extracting frames from videos, applying image filtering/enhancement, and using CNN models to classify the images into environmental condition classes. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Video is mentioned as the source data, but it is converted into frames (images) for processing.
