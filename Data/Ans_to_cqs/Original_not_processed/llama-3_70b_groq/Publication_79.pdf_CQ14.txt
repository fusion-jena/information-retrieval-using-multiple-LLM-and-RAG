Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the methodology used for hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies based on deep learning, including data augmentation techniques, sample generation, and semantic segmentation. It also presents the results of the classification using different datasets and metrics. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
