Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's training loss against the learning rate is plotted to determine the appropriate learning rate, as shown in Fig. 11. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used to do so are not mentioned.
