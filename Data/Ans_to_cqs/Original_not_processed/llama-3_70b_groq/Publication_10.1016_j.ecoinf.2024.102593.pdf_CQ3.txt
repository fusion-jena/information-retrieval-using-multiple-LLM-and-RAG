Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text discusses active learning, model selection, and transfer learning using embeddings, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the NIPS4Bplus dataset has "rich labels" associated with it, and the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset uses automatic detailed labels generated with a noise filtering algorithm. This suggests that some form of labeling or annotation is being used, but the specific techniques are not described.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
