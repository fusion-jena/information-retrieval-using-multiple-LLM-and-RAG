Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, F1-score, false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentage, balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure FÎ², Cohen's kappa coefficient k, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics are used to comprehensively assess the performance and effectiveness of the model. The use of confusion matrices provides detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model, enabling the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories.
