Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a fine-tuned transformer model, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), is used for classification tasks. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement BERT. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework is used.
