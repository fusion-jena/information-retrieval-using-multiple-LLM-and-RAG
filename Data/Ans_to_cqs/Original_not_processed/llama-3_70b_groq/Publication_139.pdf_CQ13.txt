Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Optimizer: Adam
* Initial learning rate: 0.0007 (cid:0) 7
* Decay: 1Ã—10

These hyperparameters were used to train the model, which typically took between 10 and 15 epochs to converge, with each epoch taking approximately 1 minute on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Early stopping was also used to prevent overfitting.
