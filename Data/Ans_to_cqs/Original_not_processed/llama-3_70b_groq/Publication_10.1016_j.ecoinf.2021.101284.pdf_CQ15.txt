Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses various topics, including COVID-19 diagnosis using X-ray and CT images, air pollution, and data analysis using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
