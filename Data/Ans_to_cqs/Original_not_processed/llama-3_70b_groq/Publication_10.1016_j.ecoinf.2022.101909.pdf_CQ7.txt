Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are 80% for training and 20% for testing, with the presence and absence samples. Additionally, 10% of the dataset was used as a validation subset in the training stage. It is also mentioned that samples extracted from the same audio file were separated, both for training and for testing and validation, to reduce bias.
