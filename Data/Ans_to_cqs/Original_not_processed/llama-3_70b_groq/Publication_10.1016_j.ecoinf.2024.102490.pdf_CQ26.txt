Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, climate suitability, and geographic information systems (GIS). It discusses various statistical and machine learning techniques such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Generalized Linear Models, and Random Forest, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques are not related to addressing data bias in deep learning preprocessing. If you're looking for information on addressing data bias, I can provide general information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but it would not be based on the provided context.
