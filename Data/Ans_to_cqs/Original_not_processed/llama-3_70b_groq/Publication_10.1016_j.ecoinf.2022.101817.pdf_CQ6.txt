Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The section 2.5 "Preprocessing" only mentions that "Image filtering/enhancement is applied" after completing the environmental classification phase, but it does not specify what these filtering/enhancement steps are. It does not provide information on normalization, scaling, cleaning, or any other preprocessing steps that may be involved before training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
