Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference a paper by Kingma and Ba (2014) titled "Adam: a method for stochastic optimization" [46]. This suggests that the Adam optimization technique is likely used in the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of SGD or other optimization techniques.
