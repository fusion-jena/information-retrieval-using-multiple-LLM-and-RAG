Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to bioclimate variables, biological factors, and geographical environment factors, and it discusses various studies on species distribution modeling. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. If you're looking for general information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can provide some general information. Common preprocessing steps may include normalization, scaling, feature selection, handling missing values, data augmentation, and data transformation. However, the specific steps may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.
