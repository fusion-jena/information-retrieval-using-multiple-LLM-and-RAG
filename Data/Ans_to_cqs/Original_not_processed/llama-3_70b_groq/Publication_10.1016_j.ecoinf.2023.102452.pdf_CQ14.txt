Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses Genetic Programming (GP) and its application in Input Variable Selection (IVS) and modeling, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
