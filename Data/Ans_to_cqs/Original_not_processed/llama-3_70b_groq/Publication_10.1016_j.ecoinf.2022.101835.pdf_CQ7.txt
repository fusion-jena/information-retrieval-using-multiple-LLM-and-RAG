Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the optimization of machine learning models using Optuna, the structure and hyperparameters of the models, and the evaluation metrics used to compare their performance. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
