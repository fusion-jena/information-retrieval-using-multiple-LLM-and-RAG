Answer::: 

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is split randomly. In Section IV, it is mentioned that the endemic bird data is "randomly split" into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. This suggests that random sampling is used to divide the data into training and testing sets. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the training dataset is further divided into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for validation. However, the specific criteria or method used to split the data into these subsets are not provided.
