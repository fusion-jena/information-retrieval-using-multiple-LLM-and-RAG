Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Camera traps: These are used to collect images of species, which can be used for species detection and sex identification.
2. Acoustic recorders: These are used to collect audio data, which can be used to detect species presence.
3. Non-invasive genetic sampling: This includes collecting scat, hair, urine, or feathers to obtain genetic data, which can be used for species detection and sex identification.
4. Track collection: This involves collecting tracks of species, which can be used for species detection and sex identification.

These methods are considered non-invasive and cost-effective, making them suitable for collecting data on rare species that occur over large areas. The collected data can then be used to train machine learning models, such as the FIT method mentioned in the context, to identify species and sex.
