Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. The context mentions "accuracy" multiple times, such as in Table 2, which shows the accuracy of the models without post-processing and with post-processing according to the three goals defined earlier. Additionally, the text states that "the accuracy followed the same tendency, with an average accuracy for G1, G2, and G3 respectively equal to 0.74, 0.81, and 0.92" (Table 3). There is no mention of precision, recall, or other evaluation metrics in the provided context.
