Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the model, including the use of transfer learning and pre-trained weights from ImageNet, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
