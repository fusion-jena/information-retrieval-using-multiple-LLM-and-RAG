Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses Google Earth Engine (GEE), wildfire science, and the FIREMAP system, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. If the link is not mentioned in the context, I cannot provide an answer.
