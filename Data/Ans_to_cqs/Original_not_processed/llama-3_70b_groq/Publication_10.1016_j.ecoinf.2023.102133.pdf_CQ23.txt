Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for the model, the use of a specific configuration for analysis, and the standardization of the dataset to reduce the influence of outliers. However, it does not mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.

It is possible that these measures were taken, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
