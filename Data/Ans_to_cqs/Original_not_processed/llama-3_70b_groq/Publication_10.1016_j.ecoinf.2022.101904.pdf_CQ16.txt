Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping, the architecture of the proposed model, and the cost of computation in terms of time. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
