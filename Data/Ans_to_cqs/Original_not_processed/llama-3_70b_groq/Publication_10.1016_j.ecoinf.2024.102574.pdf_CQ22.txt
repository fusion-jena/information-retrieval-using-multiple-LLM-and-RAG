Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are R2 and RMSE. R2 (coefficient of determination) measures the goodness of fit of the model, and RMSE (root mean squared error) measures the average magnitude of the errors. These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the AGB estimation model. Specifically, the context mentions that the R2 of AGB estimation is close to Alonzo et al. (2020) and Juan-Ovejero et al. (2023), and the RMSE is 2.46 kg. 

However, it does not mention other common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these metrics are used in this specific context.
