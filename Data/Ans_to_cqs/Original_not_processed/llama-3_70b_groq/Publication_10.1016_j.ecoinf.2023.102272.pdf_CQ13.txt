Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information about the parameters used in classical machine learning models (xgbTree, RF, NNET, and DNN) and the architecture of the deep learning models (DeepConvLSTM and CNN). It does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
