Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using the validation set, which is created by randomly distributing the augmented segments with a ratio of 0.8/0.2 between the training and validation sets. The model is trained for 40 epochs, and the training process is repeated ten times to account for the effect of random weight initialization in neural networks. The performance metrics, such as the confusion matrix, True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN), are recorded during each execution on the testing dataset. These metrics can be used to monitor the model's performance during training.
