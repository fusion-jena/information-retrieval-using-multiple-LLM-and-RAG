Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the authors add a number of known 'non-detections' with distance of NA to their dataset of detected or simulated calls, increasing their total number of observations M to 300 per ARU. This suggests that they are using a form of oversampling to balance their dataset and reduce bias.

Additionally, the authors use a data augmentation variable zi,j for each observation to indicate whether it was a true call or not, which allows them to model the total realized number of calls including false positive CNN detections (NFPi = j=1zi,j) in relation to their data augmentation parameter Ïˆ, pi,j and the binary detection outcomes of each call (yi,j).

There is no mention of stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques are used in the preprocessing pipeline.

In summary, data augmentation and oversampling are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, but it is unclear whether other techniques such as stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used.
