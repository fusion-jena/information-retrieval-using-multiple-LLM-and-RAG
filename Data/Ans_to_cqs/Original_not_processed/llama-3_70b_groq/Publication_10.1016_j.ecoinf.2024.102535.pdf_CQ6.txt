Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data augmentation was applied to all extracted patches, which includes a 90Â° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. This suggests that the data was augmented to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, but it does not provide information about other preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know what other preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning model.
