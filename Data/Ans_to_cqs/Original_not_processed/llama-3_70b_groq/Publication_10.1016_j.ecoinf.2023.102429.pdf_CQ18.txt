Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) cross-validation (RMSEcv) values. The context states that "parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values" (De Santana et al., 2021). This suggests that the model performance was evaluated during training using RMSEcv, and the optimal parameter values were chosen based on the results. However, the exact strategy or procedure used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
