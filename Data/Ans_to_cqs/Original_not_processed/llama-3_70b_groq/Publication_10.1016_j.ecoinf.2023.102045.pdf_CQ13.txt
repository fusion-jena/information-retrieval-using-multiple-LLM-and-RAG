Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and scientific communication, with references to R packages and color maps. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific model architecture, making it impossible to determine the hyperparameters used.
