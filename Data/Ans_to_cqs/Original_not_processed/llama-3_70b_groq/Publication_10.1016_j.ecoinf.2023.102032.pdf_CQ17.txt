Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, wetlands, and earth observation, with mentions of Sentinel-2 and land use classes in the study area. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
