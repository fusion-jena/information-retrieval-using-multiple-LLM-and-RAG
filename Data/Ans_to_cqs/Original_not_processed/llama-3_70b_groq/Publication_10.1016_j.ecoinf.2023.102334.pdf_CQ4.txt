Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of the Transformer model in computer vision, particularly in the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, and its comparison with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It discusses the self-attention mechanism, tokenization of images, and the use of a hybrid approach combining the Transformer with a CNN backbone. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
