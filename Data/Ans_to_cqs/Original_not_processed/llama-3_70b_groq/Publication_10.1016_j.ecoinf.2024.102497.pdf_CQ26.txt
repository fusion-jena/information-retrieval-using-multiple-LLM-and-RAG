Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing of GF-6 remote sensing data, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. It also discusses the implementation of CART and Random Forest regression models for predicting water depths. However, it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
