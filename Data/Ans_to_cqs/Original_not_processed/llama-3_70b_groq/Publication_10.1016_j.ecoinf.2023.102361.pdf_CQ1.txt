Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the dataset splitting, deep learning models, and their architectures. It mentions that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
