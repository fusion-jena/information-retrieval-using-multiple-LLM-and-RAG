Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, and presents results of a deep learning model for wetland mapping. It also describes the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer model and presents classification maps and extracted features. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
