Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is primarily for classification and recognition tasks. Specifically, it is used for recognizing and classifying visual images and acoustic recordings. For example, Atila et al. (2021) used deep learning for image classification, while Nanni et al. (2020) used it for animal audio classification.
