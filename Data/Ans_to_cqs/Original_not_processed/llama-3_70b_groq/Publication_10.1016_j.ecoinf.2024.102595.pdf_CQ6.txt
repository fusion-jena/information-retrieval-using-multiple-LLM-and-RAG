Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data transformation and feature selection. 

In the data transformation process, two fundamental techniques are employed: MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder. The MinMaxScaler is used to scale the data, which is especially crucial for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and neural networks. The LabelEncoder is applied to transform categorical fields into numerical values. This is necessary because agricultural datasets often include categorical data, such as soil types or crop varieties, which must be encoded to numerical labels before being fed into machine learning algorithms.

There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as cleaning, normalization, or handling missing values. However, it can be inferred that these steps might have been performed as part of the data preprocessing stage, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
