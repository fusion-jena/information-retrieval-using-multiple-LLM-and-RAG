Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be related to environmental data, such as wastewater treatment, greenhouse gas emissions, and per capita CO2 equivalents, but it does not provide any information about machine learning models or their evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
