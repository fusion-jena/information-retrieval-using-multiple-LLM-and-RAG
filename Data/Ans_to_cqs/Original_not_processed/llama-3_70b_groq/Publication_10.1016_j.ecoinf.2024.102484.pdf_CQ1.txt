Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Remotely sensed imagery: The study by Huang et al. (2019) mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery for monitoring ecosystem service change.

2. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of datasets such as the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids.

3. Direct acquisition: The context mentions direct acquisition of data on land-use types, elevation, slope, mean annual temperature, and precipitation.

4. Online resources: The context provides URLs for online resources such as the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the Research Data Center for Economy and Society (RESC) in China.

No mention is made of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
