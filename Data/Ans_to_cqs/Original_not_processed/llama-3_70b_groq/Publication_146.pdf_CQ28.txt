Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the creation of a dataset, the use of Sentinel-1 images, and the YoloV3 model architecture, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
