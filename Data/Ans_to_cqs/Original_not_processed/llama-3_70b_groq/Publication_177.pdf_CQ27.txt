Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the initialization, fine-tuning, and optimization of the deep neural network models, as well as their performance evaluation on the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets. It does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
