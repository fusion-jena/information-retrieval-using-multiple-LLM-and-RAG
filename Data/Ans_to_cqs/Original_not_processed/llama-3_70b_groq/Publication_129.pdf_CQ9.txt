Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various papers and research related to agricultural pests recognition, Faster R-CNN approach, and other topics, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
