Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be related to acoustic detection, bird species, and conservation, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information on the dataset and model architecture, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
