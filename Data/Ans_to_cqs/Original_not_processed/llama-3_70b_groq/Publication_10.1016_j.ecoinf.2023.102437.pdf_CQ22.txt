Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). The context mentions that "R2 was >0.5 for all three models, with LSTM and Lasso models exhibiting the highest correlation coefficients" and provides RMSE values for the models. However, it does not mention other common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
