Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training or postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, discussing variables such as climate, terrain, human activity, and vegetation indices (kNDVI), as well as data processing and analysis using ArcGIS Pro. There is no mention of machine learning model training or evaluation, which is where postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix would typically be involved.
