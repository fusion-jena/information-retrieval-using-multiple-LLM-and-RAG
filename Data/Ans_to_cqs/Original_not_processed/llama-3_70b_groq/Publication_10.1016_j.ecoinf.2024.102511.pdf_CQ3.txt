Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly for marine mammals. It discusses the importance of automated classification routines, the role of deep neural networks, and the need for significant sample sizes for all classes. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
