Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention "inception layers" which is a type of layer commonly used in TensorFlow. Additionally, one of the references cited is a paper about TensorFlow, which suggests that TensorFlow might be used in the project. However, it is not explicitly stated, and it is possible that other frameworks like PyTorch could also be used. Therefore, I can't confirm the exact framework used, but TensorFlow is a likely candidate.
