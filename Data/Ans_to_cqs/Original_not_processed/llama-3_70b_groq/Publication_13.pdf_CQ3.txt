Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, domain adaptation, and the effects of dataset size and quality on model performance. It does not provide information on how the images were annotated or prepared for training the CNN models.
