Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the training process, including the use of weighted cross-entropy as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent as the optimization algorithm. It also mentions that the model accuracy was assessed after each full training set iteration (epoch), but it does not specify when the training is considered complete.

However, it can be inferred that the authors might be monitoring the training and validation loss curves (as shown in Fig. 3) to determine when the training is complete. A common criterion for stopping training is when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting. But this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
