Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the model evaluation is performed to calculate the correct rate, but the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix are not mentioned.

The context only mentions the training process, which involves preparing the data, building the model, compiling the model, training the model, and testing the model. The testing step involves evaluating the model to obtain the correct rate, but it does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
