Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Landsat 8 satellite images, atmospheric correction, and machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests for evaluating fire risk in tropical forests. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models.
