Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the methodology used for species distribution modeling, including the ensemble framework, model evaluation metrics (AUC and TSS), and landscape resistance modeling. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when the training process is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
