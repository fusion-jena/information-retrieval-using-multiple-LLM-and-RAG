Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, in environmental studies, water quality monitoring, and agriculture. It discusses the architectures and advantages of CNNs, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
