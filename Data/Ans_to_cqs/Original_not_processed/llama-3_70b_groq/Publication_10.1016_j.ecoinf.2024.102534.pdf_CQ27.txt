Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be an authorship contribution statement, listing the roles and contributions of various individuals to a research project or paper. It mentions tasks such as writing, review, editing, resources, project administration, data curation, supervision, investigation, validation, visualization, software, methodology, formal analysis, and conceptualization, but does not provide information about deploying a deep learning model.
