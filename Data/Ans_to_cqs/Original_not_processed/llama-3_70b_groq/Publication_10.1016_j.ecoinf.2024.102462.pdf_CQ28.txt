Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the importance of fieldwork, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the application of deep learning (DL) techniques for image analysis, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model.
