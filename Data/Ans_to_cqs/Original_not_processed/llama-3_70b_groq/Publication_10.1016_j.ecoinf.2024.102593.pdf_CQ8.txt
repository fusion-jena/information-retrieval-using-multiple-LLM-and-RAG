Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a GitHub repository in one of the references: "McDonald, Kyle, Tan, Manny, Mann, Yotam, 2016. Google Creative Lab/AI Experiments Bird Sounds, 2016. https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-bird-sounds." This repository is related to the Bird Sounds project, but it is not clear if it contains the code for the BirdNET pipeline.

I couldn't find any other information in the provided context that points to a specific code repository for the BirdNET pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
