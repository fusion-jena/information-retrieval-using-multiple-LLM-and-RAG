Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the choice of 30 epochs was made based on the empirical observation that in all of the experiments, the learning always converged well within 30 epochs. This suggests that the authors may have used a fixed number of epochs as a stopping criterion, rather than a specific metric such as validation loss plateau.
