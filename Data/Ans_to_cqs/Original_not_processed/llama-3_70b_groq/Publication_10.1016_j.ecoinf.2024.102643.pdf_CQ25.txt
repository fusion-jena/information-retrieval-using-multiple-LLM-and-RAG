Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context lists various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Generalized Boosted Model, but it does not specify their purpose or mention a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
