Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model specification, implementation, and projection, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after training the MLP model.

The context mentions that the model was trained by minimizing the mean squared error, and the model specifications are listed in Table 2. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as calculating metrics, generating saliency maps, or creating a confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the context.
