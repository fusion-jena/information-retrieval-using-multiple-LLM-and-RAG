Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. The context primarily focuses on the architectures and performances of various deep learning models for HSI classification tasks, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure generalizability.

The context only mentions that some of the models achieved the highest classification accuracy on three data sets, but it does not provide details on how these datasets were selected, split, or used for training and testing. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models based on the provided context.
