Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing feature selection and the use of machine learning algorithms to improve understanding and decision-making outcomes, but it does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
