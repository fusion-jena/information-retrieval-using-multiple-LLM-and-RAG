Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the interpretability of deep learning models in agricultural applications, discussing methods like gradient-based sensitivity analysis, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and class activation maps. It does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
