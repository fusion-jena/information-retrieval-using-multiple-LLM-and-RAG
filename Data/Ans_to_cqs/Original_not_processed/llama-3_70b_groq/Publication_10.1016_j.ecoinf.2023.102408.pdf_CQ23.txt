Answer: 

According to the provided context, one measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the model is stratified sampling. The context states that "A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations for this evaluation." This technique randomly allocated 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. This suggests that the model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate subset, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizable to new, unseen data. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
