Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text mentions that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. This suggests that the dataset used is a weed dataset, but the specific name is not provided. It is referred to as the "DeepWeeds dataset" in the results section.
