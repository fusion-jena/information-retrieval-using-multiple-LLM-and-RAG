Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the application of deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts, but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access it. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
