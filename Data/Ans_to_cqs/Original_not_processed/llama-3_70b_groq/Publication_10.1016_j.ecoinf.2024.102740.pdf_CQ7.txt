Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on random forest techniques, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, and machine learning applications in remote sensing and ecological informatics. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples in the random forest technique, which is a method to estimate the generalization error of the model. The OOB samples are those not included in the training subset. Additionally, the context mentions that 34 ground data points were used for ML training, and the total number of samples used for validation is 8. 

But, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
