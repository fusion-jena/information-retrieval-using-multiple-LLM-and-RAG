Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. This is inferred from the mention of "each fold" in the context, which suggests that the data is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained and evaluated on each fold separately. This is a common technique used to assess the robustness of a model and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions that the "frames from Trainingclips were used to train the models" and "The Testingclips were used to assess the robustness of our method on short sequences centered around the presence of fish presence." This further supports the idea that the model performance is being evaluated on a separate test set (Testingclips) during training.

However, the exact implementation details of the k-fold cross-validation strategy, such as the number of folds and the specific evaluation metrics used, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
