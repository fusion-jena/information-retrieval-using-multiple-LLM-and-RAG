Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) for image classification, which is a machine learning technique. It explains how RF works, including the creation of multiple decision trees using the Gini coefficient to split them, and how the final classification is determined by a majority vote of the decision trees.

There is no mention of deep learning, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
