Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) to evaluate the performance of the models.

MSE and MAE are used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance. R2 is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the data, with higher values indicating better performance.

It is worth noting that accuracy, precision, and recall are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models, whereas the context provided seems to be focused on regression models, which is why MSE, MAE, and R2 are used instead.
