Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text acknowledges the help of the National Museum of Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, and expresses gratitude to the iDigBio initiative for providing access to herbarium data. However, it does not provide a direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
