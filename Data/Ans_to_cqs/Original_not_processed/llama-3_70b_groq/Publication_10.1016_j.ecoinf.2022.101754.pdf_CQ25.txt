Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for regression tasks, specifically for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forests. The context mentions the use of machine learning models, including deep learning-based methods, to retrieve forest AGB from combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 data. It also mentions the use of regression models such as AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression to model forest AGB. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for regression tasks, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated.
