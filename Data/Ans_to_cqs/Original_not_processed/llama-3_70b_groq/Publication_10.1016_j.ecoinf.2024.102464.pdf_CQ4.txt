Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
