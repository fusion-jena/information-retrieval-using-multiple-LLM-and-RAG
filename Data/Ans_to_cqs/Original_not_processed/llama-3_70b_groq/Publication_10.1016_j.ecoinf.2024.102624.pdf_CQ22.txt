Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) for classification tasks. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention the calculation of Overall Accuracy (OA), User's Accuracies (UAs), and Producer's Accuracies (PAs). Additionally, it mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions for model building and hyperparameter tuning.
