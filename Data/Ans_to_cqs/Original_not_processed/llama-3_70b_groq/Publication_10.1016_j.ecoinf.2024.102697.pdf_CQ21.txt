Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on model complexity, feature selection, and model explainability, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it is mentioned that hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This suggests that some form of model evaluation or validation was performed, but the exact postprocessing steps are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
