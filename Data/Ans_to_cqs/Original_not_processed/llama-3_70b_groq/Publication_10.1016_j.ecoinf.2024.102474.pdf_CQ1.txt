Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge, and that Sentinel-2 is one of the keywords, which suggests that the data may be derived from Earth observation satellites. Additionally, the context mentions the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which is often calculated from remote sensing data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data may be collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
