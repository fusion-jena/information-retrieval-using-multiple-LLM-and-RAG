Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is specified in the "Train/test split" hyperparameter in Table 2. The best assignment for this hyperparameter is 0.9/0.1 for the segmentation model and 0.8/0.2 for the classification model. This suggests that the data is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 0.9:0.1 for the segmentation model and 0.8:0.2 for the classification model. However, it is not clear if there is a separate validation set or if the testing set is used for validation as well.
