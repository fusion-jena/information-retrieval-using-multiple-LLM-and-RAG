Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information from satellite imagery. It discusses the importance of labeling data for training the U-Net model and the use of phenological characteristics for classification. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
