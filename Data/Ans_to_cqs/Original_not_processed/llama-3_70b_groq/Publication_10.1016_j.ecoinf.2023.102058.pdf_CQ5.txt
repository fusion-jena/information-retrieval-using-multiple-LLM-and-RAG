Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to hyperspectral data and water quality parameters, with references to remote sensing and machine learning applications. It discusses the importance of sample distribution, atmospheric correction algorithms, and creating a representative dataset for machine learning models.

The only dataset mentioned in the context is a collection of 32 water samples collected from 30 reservoirs with different trophic levels, which were used for laboratory analyses during an aerial imaging campaign. However, this dataset is not a typical deep learning pipeline dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
