Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, such as VGG19 and ResNet50, and the processing of image data with varying numbers of bands (e.g., 8, 36, 72). However, it does not specify the source or name of the dataset being used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
