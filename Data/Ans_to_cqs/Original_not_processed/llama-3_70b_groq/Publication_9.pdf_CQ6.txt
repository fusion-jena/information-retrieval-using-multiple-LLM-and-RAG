Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model convergence, and the use of pre-trained CNNs for image recognition tasks. It does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: removing missing or irrelevant data
* Data normalization: scaling the data to a common range to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data
* Feature scaling: scaling the features to a common range to improve model performance

These preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given information.
