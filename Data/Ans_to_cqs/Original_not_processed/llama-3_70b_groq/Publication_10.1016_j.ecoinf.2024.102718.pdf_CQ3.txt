Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models and techniques used for rice plant disease detection, such as transformer architecture, Xception, and LIME explainable technique. It also mentions data acquisition, augmentation, and preprocessing techniques, but it does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
