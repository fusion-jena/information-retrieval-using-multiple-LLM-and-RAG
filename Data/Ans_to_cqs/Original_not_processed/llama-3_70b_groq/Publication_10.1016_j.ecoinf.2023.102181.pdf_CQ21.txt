Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the following steps are involved:

1. Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the response variable across the full extent of the study area, denoted as ̂Zp(s).

2. Residual calculation: The residuals are re-calculated for the validation step.

3. Metrics calculation: The true validation statistics, VE and RMSE, are calculated by comparing the predicted response surface ̂Zp(s) with the actual response raster surface Z(s).

No mention is made of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these steps are involved in the postprocessing.
