Answer:::

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling, classifier selection, and sample thinning in the context of ecology and environmental science.

The mentioned techniques, such as random forests and MaxEnt, are machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks, but they are not specific to deep learning. The context does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
