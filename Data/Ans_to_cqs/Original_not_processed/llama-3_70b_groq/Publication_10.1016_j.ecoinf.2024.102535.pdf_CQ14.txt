Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the different network architectures used, such as VGG, ResNet, and Xception, and presents the results of experiments in terms of F1-scores for substratum characterization criteria and sites. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used.
