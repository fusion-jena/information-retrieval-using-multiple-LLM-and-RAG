Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on spectral analysis and preprocessing methods in the field of ecological informatics, mentioning techniques such as continuum removal (CR), random forest (RF), continuous wavelet transformation (CWT), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), convolutional neural network (CNN), successive projections algorithm (SPA), weight average partial least-squares regression (WAPLSR), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). 

However, it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
