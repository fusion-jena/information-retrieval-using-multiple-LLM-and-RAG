Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and their applications in areas like speech recognition, language models, and time series forecasting. It also includes references to various research papers on topics like land cover/land use classification, El Ni√±o southern oscillation, and statistical learning. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
