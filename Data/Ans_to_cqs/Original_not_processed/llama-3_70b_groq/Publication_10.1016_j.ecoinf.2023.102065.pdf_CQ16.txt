Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the process of fine-tuning CNN models with ROI data from the study site, data augmentation, and the formation of training, validation, and test sets. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
