Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a research paper on animal behavior analysis, and it discusses various topics such as stereotypic behavior, physiological stress, and object tracking. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
