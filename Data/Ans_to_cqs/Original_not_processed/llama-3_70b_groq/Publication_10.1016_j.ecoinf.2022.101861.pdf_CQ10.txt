Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bird research, ecology, and conservation, with references to various research papers and publications. While some of the papers may mention the use of machine learning or deep learning techniques, there is no explicit mention of a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
