Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper discussing the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters. It provides references to various studies and research papers, but it does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
