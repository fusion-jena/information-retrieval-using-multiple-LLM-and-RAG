Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and sources, covering topics such as deep learning, neuroscience, and signal processing. While some of the references may discuss deep learning models, none of them explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
