Answer: 

Based on the provided context, specifically Table 6, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (BEV Faster R-CNN algorithm) are:

1. True Positives (TP)
2. False Negatives (FN)
3. False Positives (FP)
4. Recall (R)
5. Precision (P)
6. F-score (F)

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of object detection models, including deep learning models. The recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly predicted, precision measures the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actual positive instances, and the F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
