Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models for animal classification using camera trap images, their performance, and the importance of model size for edge computing on IoT devices.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and dropout. By setting a random seed, the randomness is fixed, and the results can be reproduced.

In the context provided, it is not mentioned whether a random seed value was set or not. Therefore, it is unclear what strategy was employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
