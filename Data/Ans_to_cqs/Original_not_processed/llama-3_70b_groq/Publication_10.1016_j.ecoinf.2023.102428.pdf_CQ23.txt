Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and accuracy assessment of the LULC classification model. It provides details on the model's parameters, performance, and accuracy assessment results but does not discuss the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset with a reasonable number of samples per class (1688, as mentioned in Table 7), which might have helped in ensuring some level of generalizability. Additionally, the model's performance is reported in terms of accuracy rate and skill measure, which suggests that some form of evaluation or testing was performed. However, it is unclear whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were employed to ensure generalizability.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
