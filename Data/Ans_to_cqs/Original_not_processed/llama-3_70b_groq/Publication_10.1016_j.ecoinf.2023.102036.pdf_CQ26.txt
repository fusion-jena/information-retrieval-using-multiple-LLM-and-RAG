Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning in computer vision, particularly in the field of fisheries, and mentions the limitation of dataset size. However, it does not provide specific information on how to address data bias.

The query mentions several techniques that can be used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to mitigate the effects of biased data. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine which specific techniques are used in this particular context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
