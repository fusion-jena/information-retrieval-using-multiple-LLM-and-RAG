Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their applications, and their limitations, as well as model performance assessment techniques and machine learning algorithms used for estimating water quality parameters. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
