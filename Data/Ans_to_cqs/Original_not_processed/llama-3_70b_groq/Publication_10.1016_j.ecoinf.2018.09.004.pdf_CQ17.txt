Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on a machine learning experiment for predicting seagrass existence and family, using techniques like cross-validation, decision trees, and random forests. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods specifically designed for deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
