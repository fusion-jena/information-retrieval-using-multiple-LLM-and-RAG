Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some hints about sampling strategies and validation areas.

In section 2.3.4, it is mentioned that the authors relied on Chuvieco (2020) for defining the training and testing samples, which suggests that at least 196 test points should be considered for categorical variables. Additionally, the authors explored new sampling strategies that combine the previous scientific foundation with the current capabilities of GEE.

It is also mentioned that Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979) suggest at least 50 pixels per thematic class, and the authors implemented an alternative strategy by including pure training areas with at least 50 pixels in total, which prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried out through simplified random sampling.

However, the exact criteria for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
