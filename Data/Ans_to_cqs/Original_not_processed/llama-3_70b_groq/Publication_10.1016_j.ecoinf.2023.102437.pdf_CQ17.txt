Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the Lasso model, which is a type of regularization method that uses L1 regularization to reduce overfitting. 

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting.

The context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
