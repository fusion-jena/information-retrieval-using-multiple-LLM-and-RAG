Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing ecological informatics, forest fires, and machine learning models, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The references cited in the context are academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to this query.
