Answer: The context does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. It only mentions that the models were implemented using the TensorFlow framework and experiments were conducted on a local workstation with a specific CPU, memory, and GPU configuration. There is no mention of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
