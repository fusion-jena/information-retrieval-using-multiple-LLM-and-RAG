Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and other environmental-related topics. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
