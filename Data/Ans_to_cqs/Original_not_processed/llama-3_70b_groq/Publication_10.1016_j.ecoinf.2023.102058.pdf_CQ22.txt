Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), and bias. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the models in calibration, validation, and testing steps.
