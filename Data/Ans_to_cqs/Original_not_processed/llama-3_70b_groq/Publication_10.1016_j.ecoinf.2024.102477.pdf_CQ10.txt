Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references and a brief abstract related to air pollution analysis using deep learning, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
