Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically tree-based methods like LightGBM and XGBoost, and hyperparameter optimization techniques. It also discusses the use of Bayesian optimizers and TDO to tune hyperparameters. However, it does not provide any information about data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
