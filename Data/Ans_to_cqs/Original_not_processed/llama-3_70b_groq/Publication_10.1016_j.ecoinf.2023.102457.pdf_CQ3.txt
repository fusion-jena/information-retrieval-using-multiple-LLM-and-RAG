Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on the use of pre-trained CNNs, feature extraction, and classification methods for individual acoustic discrimination in the context of animal vocalizations. It discusses the potential of deep learning methods for feature extraction and classification, but it does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that self-supervised auto-encoders can be used to efficiently classify unlabeled data on vocalizing species, which could enable a less laborious and more efficient annotation of large data sets of vocalizations. This suggests that the annotation process might be automated or semi-automated, but the exact techniques used are not specified.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
