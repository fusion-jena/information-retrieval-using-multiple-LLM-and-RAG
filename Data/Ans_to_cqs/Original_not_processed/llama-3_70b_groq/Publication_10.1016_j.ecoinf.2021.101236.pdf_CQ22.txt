Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are sample-wise mean average precision (mAP), class-wise mean average precision (cmAP), top-1 accuracy, F0.5 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in a multi-label classification scenario. The sample-wise evaluation benefits from the imbalance in the test dataset, where common species are more likely to occur, while the class-wise evaluation provides a balanced measure that reflects the need for precise primary predictions.
