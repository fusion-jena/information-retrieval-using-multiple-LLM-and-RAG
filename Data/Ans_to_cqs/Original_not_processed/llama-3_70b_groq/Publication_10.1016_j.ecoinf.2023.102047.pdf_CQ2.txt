Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. There are multiple references to image sizes, object detection, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image processing tasks. Specifically, the context mentions image sizes of 512, 640, 768, 896, 1024, 1280, and 1536, which are typical sizes used in computer vision tasks.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that other data formats like CSV might be used for storing or processing metadata related to the images, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
