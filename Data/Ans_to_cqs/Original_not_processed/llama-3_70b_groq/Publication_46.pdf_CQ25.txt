Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is for probability distribution modelling, particularly for species distribution modelling. It is used to predict the occurrence of a species (Rhododendron arboreum) based on ecological and atmospheric variables. The model is designed to establish a nonlinear relationship between the bioclimatic parameters and the species distribution.
