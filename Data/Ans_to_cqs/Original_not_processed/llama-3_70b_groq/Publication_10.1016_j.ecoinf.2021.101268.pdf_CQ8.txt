Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context primarily discusses the introduction of a new dataset, Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, and references various research papers related to plant species classification and disease detection using deep learning models. However, it does not provide any information about the code repository or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
