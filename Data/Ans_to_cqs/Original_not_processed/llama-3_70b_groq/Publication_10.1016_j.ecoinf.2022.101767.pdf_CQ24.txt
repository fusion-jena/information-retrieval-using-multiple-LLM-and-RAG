Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness. The context appears to be discussing a study on wild bird species in online shared videos, including the analysis of factors that affect the number of views on these videos. It does not provide any information related to deep learning or handling randomness in a pipeline.
