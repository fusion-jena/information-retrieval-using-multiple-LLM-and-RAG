Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used for herbarium species identification, which involves classifying images of herbarium specimens into different plant species. The model is trained and tested on a large dataset of herbarium images, and the results show its potential for automatic or semi-automatic species identification, which can aid taxonomists and experts in their annotation, classification, and revision work at herbarium.
