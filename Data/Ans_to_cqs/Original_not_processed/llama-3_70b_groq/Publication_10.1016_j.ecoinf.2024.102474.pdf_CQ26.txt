Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the EarthNet2021 Challenge, the prediction task, and the implementation of models using PyTorch Lightning and hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
