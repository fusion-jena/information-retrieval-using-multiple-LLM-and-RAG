Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used in specific models, such as the "improved progressive learning approach" used in EfficientNetV2, which dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. 

It does not provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization. These methods are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
