Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. Miss Rate (MR)
2. False Alarm Rate (FAR)
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F1-score

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the pollen-bearing bee detection models. The formulas for computing MR, FAR, Precision, and Recall are provided in the context, and the F1 score is used to gauge the balance between Precision and Recall.
