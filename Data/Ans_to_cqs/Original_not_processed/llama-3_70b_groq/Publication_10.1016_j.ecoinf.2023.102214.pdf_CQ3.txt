Answer: 

The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is evident from the text, which states that the project had 22,120 annotations, referring to "machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos" (Fig. 1). Additionally, Fig. 2 shows an annotated snow leopard with bounding boxes around the animal, which were created using a computer vision model based on machine learning. There is no mention of instance segmentation or any other annotation technique in the provided context.
