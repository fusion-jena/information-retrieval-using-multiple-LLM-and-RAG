Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the 'metrics' function, which calculated three selected model parameters: RMSE, MAE, and R2. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance, but the context does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
