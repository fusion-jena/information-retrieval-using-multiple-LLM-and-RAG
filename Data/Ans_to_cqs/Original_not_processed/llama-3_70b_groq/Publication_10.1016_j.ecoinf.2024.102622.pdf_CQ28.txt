Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and agricultural applications, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
