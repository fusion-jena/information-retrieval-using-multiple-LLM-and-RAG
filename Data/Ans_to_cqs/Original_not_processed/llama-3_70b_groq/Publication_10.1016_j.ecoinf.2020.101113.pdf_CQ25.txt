Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Although the text does not explicitly state the purpose, it can be inferred from the context. The model is trained to recognize different bird species from their calls, which is a classic classification problem. The authors mention that CNNs are capable of scaling to a high number of classes, which suggests that the model is designed to classify multiple bird species. Additionally, the authors compare the performance of CNNs to other methods that are typically used for classification tasks, such as nearest neighbors and decision trees. Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
