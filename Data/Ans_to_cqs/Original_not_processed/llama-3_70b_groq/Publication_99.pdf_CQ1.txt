Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing the training and implementation of various deep learning models, such as PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks, for tasks like image reconstruction and plant species identification. The context provides details on the model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures, but it does not mention how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
