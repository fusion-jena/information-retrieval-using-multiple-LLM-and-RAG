Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through underwater video devices. Coro and Walsh (2021) proposed an intelligent and cost-effective remote underwater video device for fish size monitoring, which suggests that video data is being used as input for the deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings, which implies that video or image data is being used to collect raw data.

It is also possible that sensors are being used to collect data, as the context mentions monitoring fish size and length, which could be done using sensors such as cameras or other underwater sensors. However, there is no explicit mention of sensors being used for data collection.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that underwater video devices are likely being used to collect raw data for the deep learning pipeline, and possibly sensors as well.
