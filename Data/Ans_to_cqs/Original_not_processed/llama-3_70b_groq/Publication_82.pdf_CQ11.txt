Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the experimental setup, parameters, and results of the deep learning models used for plant disease detection. There is no mention of a data repository link such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
