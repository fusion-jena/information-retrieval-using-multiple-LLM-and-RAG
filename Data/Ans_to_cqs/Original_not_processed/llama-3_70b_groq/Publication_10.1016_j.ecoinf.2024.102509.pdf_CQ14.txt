Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Hyperparameter tuning was also carried out to ensure the reliability of the ANN models" and that "The selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the networkâ€™s structure". This suggests that a trial and error approach was used to determine the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons, but it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search.
