Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on comparing different machine learning models, including CNN and XGBoost, and their training times, prediction times, and optimization times. It also provides some information about the hardware used for training and prediction.

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have been performed, as the context mentions the creation of batches with a specific size and ensuring that each batch contains a certain number of patches with specific labels. This suggests that the data might have been cleaned and prepared in some way before being used for training. 

Unfortunately, the exact preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
