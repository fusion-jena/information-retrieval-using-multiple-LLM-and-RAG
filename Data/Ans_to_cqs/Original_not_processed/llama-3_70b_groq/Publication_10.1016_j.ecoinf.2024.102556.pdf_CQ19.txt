Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses various components and techniques used in the model, such as Res2Net, group convolution, YOLOv7, and Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), but it does not specify the framework used to implement these components. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
