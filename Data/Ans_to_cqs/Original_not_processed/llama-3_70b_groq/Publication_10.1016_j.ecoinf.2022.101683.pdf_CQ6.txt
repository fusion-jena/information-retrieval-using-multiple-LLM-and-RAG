Answer:::

The provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and discusses methods for handling clustered occurrence records, including thinning out records based on geographical density and weighting background point selection. It also mentions the use of a bias file to offset the effects of clustering in software programs like Maxent.

There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps typically associated with deep learning, such as normalization or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
