Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the CNN models, as well as their comparison with other baselines and commercial systems.

It is possible that the authors may have used certain strategies to handle randomness, such as setting a random seed value, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the available information.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This involves setting a fixed value for the random number generator, which helps to reproduce the same results every time the model is trained or evaluated. However, without explicit information, I cannot confirm whether this strategy was employed in this specific study.
