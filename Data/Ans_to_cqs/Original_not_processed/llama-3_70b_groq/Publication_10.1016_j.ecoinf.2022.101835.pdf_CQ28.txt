Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only mentions the libraries and tools used for building and optimizing the machine learning models, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Optuna, and LightGBM, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
