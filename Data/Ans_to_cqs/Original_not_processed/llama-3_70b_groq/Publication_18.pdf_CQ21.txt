Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, annotation, and training process of the CNN model for whale detection. It discusses the dataset creation, data augmentation, and transfer learning, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
