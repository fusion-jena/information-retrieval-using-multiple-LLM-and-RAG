Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. However, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters are optimized through a systematic evaluation of different values.

For the Random Forest model, the context mentions that the "mtry" parameter was systematically evaluated from 1 to 10 to strike a balance between stability and minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

For the Artificial Neural Network, the context mentions that the number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regularization parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. This suggests that the hyperparameters were optimized through a grid search or a similar method, but the exact method is not specified.

It is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter optimization based on the provided context.
