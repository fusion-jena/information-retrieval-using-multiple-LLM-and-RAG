Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps were performed, as the results of the model evaluation metrics and statistics are presented in Table 1. 

The metrics calculated include Accuracy, Fall-out, Precision, Specificity, Recall, and F1-score. Additionally, Confusion matrices are presented in Fig. 8 for the optimized pre-trained network with numerical inputs through different models (EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3). 

There is no mention of Saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include metrics calculation and Confusion matrix generation, but the exact steps are not fully specified.
