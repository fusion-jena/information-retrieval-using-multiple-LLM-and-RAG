Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) specifically, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. This is mentioned in the context as "the employed deep learning model combines the gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural network." Additionally, the context explains that the GRU model is used to address the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients in traditional RNNs, and it is preferred over LSTM due to its simpler architecture and faster training time.
