Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation. Specifically, the HRNet model is used for semantic segmentation to identify and extract features such as greenness, blueness, and sky openness index from social media image data. The model is employed to perform semantic segmentation processing in PyCharm software, which enables the derivation of these features using formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). Additionally, the LSTM-CNN model is used for sentiment analysis, which involves determining the sentiment index from text data.
