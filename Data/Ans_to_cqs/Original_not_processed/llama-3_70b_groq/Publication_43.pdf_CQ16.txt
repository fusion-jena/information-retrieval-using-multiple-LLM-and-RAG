Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It explains the objective of the training, which is to iteratively minimize the average loss defined in equation (1), and the update rule for the weights using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in equation (2). However, it does not specify when to stop the training process.

Typically, in deep learning, the training process is stopped when a certain criterion is met, such as when the validation loss plateaus, the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, or a maximum number of epochs is reached. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular case.
