Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the dataset used for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pollen species identification, including the number of images, data augmentation techniques, and the performance of the model. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected in the first place. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
