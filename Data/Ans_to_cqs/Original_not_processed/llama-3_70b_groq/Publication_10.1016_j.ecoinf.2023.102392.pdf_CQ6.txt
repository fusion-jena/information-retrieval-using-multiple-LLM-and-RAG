Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of a hybrid model for predicting forest fires vulnerability and a deep learning model-based approach for forests classification. It also discusses the use of XGBoost for land use/land cover classification and forest types accuracy. Additionally, it provides information on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data processing using CATALYST PROFESSIONAL image processing software, which involves camera parameter correction, setting up connection points, point fine-tuning, and editing ground control points.

However, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
