Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are data filtering and data scaling. 

Data filtering is mentioned in section 2.1, but the details of this step are not provided. 

Data scaling, on the other hand, is discussed in more detail in section 2.3. It involves spatial and temporal scaling, where spatial scaling refers to the scaling process applied to each metric of the time series. This can be done using parametrizable functions such as addTexture_3 Ã— 3_Mean, which applies spatial moving windows and aggregates the data using the mean. Other aggregation formulas such as median or standard deviation can also be used.

There is no mention of normalization or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context. However, it is possible that these steps may be involved in the overall preprocessing pipeline, but they are not explicitly mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it does discuss preprocessing steps for environmental time series data, which may be used as input to a deep learning model.
