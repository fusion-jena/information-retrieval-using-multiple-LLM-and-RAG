Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of deep learning models in remote sensing applications, particularly in handling spatial heterogeneity and transfer learning.

However, it does mention some approaches to address the limitations of deep learning models, such as using Nearest Neighbor Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic space in which predictions can be made, and employing simple data partitioning strategies like training, validation, and testing. But these approaches are not specifically related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
