Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the effect of tile size on accuracy and presents an experimental group design with varying tile sizes, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
