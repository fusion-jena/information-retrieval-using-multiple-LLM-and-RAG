Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in species distribution modeling, discussing the advantages of deep learning approaches, and citing various research papers. It does not provide information on the data collection methods used in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions "remote sensing" in the paper by Botella et al. (2023), which could be a potential method for collecting raw data. Additionally, the context cites papers related to species niche models and presence-only datasets, which might imply that the data collection methods could involve surveys or field observations. Nevertheless, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
