Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Bayesian optimization is performed using a Python-based learning software package. However, it does not specify whether the deep learning model is built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
