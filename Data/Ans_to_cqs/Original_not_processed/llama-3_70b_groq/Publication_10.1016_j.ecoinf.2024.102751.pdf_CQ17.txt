Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to soil moisture, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, with references to various studies and papers in these fields. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning methods, except for a brief suggestion in the conclusion to test advanced methods of data analysis, including machine learning or deep neural networks, in the future. However, it does not provide any information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
