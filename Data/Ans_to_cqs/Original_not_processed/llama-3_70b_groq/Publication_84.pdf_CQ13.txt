Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the parameter setting method of SVM and the performance comparison between SVM and SAE (Stacked Autoencoder) with different types of Landsat images. It does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
