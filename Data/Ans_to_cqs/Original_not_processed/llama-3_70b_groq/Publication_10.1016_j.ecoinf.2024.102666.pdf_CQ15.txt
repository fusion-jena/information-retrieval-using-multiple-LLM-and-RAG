Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on atmospheric correction algorithms, remote sensing, and land use/land cover classifications, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
