Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the advantages of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), in land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It highlights the ability of these techniques to extract hierarchical features, learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns, and facilitate real-time LULC information generation. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
