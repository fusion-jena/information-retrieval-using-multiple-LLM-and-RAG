Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of a model are optimized. The context appears to be a list of references related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, and biodiversity conservation, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization methods used for hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
