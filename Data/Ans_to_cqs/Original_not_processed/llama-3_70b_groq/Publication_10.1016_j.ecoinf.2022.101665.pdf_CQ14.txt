Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are not optimized. According to the text, "Random Forest models as implemented in the ranger package predicting the target variables as a function of the covariates were fitted using out-of-the-box hyperparameter settings." This suggests that the default hyperparameters of the Random Forest model in the ranger package were used without any tuning or optimization.
