Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and land use/land cover classification using machine learning algorithms, including support-vector networks, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors. The datasets mentioned are related to satellite image data, such as Landsat and MODIS, which are used for land cover classification. There is no mention of datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
