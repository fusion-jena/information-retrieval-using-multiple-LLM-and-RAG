Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecology, geography, and remote sensing, with references to publications and datasets related to these fields. 

However, there are a few mentions of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context, such as in the papers by Mohedano et al. (2017) and Cohen and Shashua (2017), but they do not specify the datasets used. 

Additionally, there is a mention of a case-study of aerial scene classification by Petrovska et al. (2020), but it does not provide information about the specific dataset used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
