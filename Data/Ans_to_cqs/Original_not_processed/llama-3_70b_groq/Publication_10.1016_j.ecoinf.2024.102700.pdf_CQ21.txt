Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model development process, including calibration and validation phases, and discusses the different modeling approaches used in the reviewed literature. 

However, it can be inferred that the validation phase involves assessing the model's efficiency using a subset of data not employed for calibration, which might include calculating metrics to evaluate the model's performance. But the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
