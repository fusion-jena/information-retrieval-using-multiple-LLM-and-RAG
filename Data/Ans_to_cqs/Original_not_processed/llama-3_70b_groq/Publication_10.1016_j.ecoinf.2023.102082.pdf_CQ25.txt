Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to create a high-resolution CHM (Canopy Height Model) of the Earth at 10m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. This is achieved through a convolutional neural network approach, which fuses GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images to produce a more spatially precise CHM.
