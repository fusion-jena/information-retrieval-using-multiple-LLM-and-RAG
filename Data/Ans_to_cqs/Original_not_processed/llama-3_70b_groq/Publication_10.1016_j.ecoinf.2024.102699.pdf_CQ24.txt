Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques for bird species classification using deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stochastic optimization methods, specifically the Adam optimizer (Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., 2015), which implies that randomness is involved in the optimization process. Nevertheless, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
