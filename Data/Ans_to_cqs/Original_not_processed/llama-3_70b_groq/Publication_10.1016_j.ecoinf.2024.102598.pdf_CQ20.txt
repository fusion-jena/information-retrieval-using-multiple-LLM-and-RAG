Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the performance of different machine learning models (RF, SVM, MARS, BRT, and CART) in terms of their AUC scores, TSS, kappa, and phi values, and also provides some data about forest fire areas in different regions. However, it does not provide any information about the hardware resources used for training the models.
