Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

* Mean Error of Estimation (MEE)
* Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)
* Standard Deviation (St.dev)
* Average (Ave)
* Maximum (Max)
* Minimum (Min)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different models, including MEE-GP, MEE-GP-ANN, DW-GP, and DWE-GP-ANN, in terms of their forecasting abilities. The NSE metric is specifically used to evaluate the performance of the models in terms of their accuracy, with higher values indicating better performance.

It is worth noting that other metrics, such as precision and recall, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
