Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the Neural Networks were built from scratch using TensorFlow (tf) and Keras. It does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
