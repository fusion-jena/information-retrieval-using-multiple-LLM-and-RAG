Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the training is complete when the validation set accuracy stops improving. This is mentioned in the first paragraph of the context, where it is stated that "we set the learning rate to 10^âˆ’3, and then decrease it by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving." This suggests that the validation set accuracy is being monitored during training, and when it plateaus or stops improving, the training is considered complete.
