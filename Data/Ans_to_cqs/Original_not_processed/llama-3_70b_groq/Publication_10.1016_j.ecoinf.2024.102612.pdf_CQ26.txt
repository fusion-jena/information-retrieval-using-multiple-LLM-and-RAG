Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the mean counterparts of Overall Accuracy and IoU, namely Mean Accuracy (MA) and Mean IoU (MIoU), are used to consider the individual values for each class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach enhances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 

While this does not directly address data bias, it implies that the authors are aware of the potential issue of imbalanced data and have taken steps to mitigate its impact on the classification results. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
