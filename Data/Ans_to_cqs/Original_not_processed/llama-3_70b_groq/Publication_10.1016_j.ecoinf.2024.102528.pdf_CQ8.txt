Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, which is a free application, but it does not provide information about the code repository or where the code can be accessed. The context only provides information about the model's version, its architecture, and how it was used in the study, but it does not provide a link or mention a specific platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) where the code can be found.
