Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing various aspects of deep learning models, such as dilated convolution, feature extractors, and attention mechanisms, but it does not touch on the topic of data bias or preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
