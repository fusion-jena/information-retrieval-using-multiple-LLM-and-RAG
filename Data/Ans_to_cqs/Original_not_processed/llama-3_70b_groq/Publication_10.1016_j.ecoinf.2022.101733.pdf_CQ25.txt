Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context varies. 

In the study by Olatunji (2019), the neural network model is used for the prediction of chronic kidney disease, which implies a classification task. 

In the study by Aryal (2020), the purpose is glacier segmentation in satellite images, which is a segmentation task. 

In the study by Bazzi et al. (2019), the model is used for mapping paddy rice using Sentinel-1 SAR time series, which can be considered as a classification or segmentation task. 

In the study by Bioresita et al. (2018), the model is used for automatic and rapid mapping of water surfaces from Sentinel-1 imagery, which is also a segmentation task. 

In the study by Gola et al. (2019), the support vector machine (SVM) model is used for objective microstructure classification, which is a classification task. 

In the study by Ayadi et al. (2022), the purpose is to survey resolution methods for constraint satisfaction problems in the remote sensing field, which does not involve a specific deep learning model or task. 

In the study by Albayrak et al. (2021), the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms are used to estimate the behavior of migratory bees, which can be considered as a classification or regression task. 

In the study by Royimani et al. (2022), the purpose is to estimate information on the onset of grass aging, which can be considered as a regression task. 

Overall, the purposes of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context include classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.
