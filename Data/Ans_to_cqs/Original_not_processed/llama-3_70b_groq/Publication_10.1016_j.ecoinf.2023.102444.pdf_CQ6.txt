Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, UMAP, and bioclimatic variables, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common practices in machine learning and deep learning. These steps are typically performed to prepare the data for model training, but the specific steps and techniques used may vary depending on the dataset and model architecture.

In the context of species distribution modeling, preprocessing steps might include handling missing values, transforming variables, and scaling/normalizing the data. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer to this query.
