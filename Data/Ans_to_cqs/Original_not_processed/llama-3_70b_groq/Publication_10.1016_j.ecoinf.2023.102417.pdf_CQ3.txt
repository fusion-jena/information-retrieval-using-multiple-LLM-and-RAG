Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that annotations are made manually using special software, and that Labelbox is used for annotating images. 

It can be inferred that the annotation technique used is likely semantic segmentation, as the context mentions semantic image segmentation and the use of datasets such as COCO and Cityscapes, which are commonly used for object detection and segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of IoU (Intersection over Union) as a metric, which is often used to evaluate the performance of semantic segmentation models.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
