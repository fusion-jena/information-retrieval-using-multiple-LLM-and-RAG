Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy measures the overall percentage of correct predictions. Precision measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. Recall measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct, and F1-score is a combination of precision and recall. These metrics are used to measure the efficiency of deep learning models.
