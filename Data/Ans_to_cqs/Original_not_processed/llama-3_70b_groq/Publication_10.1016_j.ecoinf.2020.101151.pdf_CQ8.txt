Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be related to a research paper discussing forest fire control, vegetation, and human impact, with references to various academic papers and publications. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
