Answer: The purpose of the Machine Learning (ML) model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for ecological classification and assessing Aboveground Biomass in semi-natural grasslands. The model is trained to classify grassland species into different categories based on their characteristics, and to estimate the Aboveground Biomass, which is an important indicator of grassland health and productivity. The model uses remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, as input and generates accurate and dynamic information on grassland ecosystems.
