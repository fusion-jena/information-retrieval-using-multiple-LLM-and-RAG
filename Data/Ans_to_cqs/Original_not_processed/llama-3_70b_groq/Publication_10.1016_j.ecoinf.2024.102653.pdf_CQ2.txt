Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the model's performance metrics, hyperparameters, and the overall architecture, but it does not specify the data format used. 

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the data might be related to time series classification, possibly from flight activity recordings, and X-ray images. This suggests that the data formats might include CSV or other formats suitable for time series data, as well as image formats for the X-ray images. 

But without explicit information, it's impossible to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
