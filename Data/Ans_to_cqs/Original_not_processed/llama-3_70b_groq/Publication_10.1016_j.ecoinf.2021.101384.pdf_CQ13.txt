Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the vessel data is aggregated at a 0.01 resolution with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model, but it does not provide details about the model's hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
