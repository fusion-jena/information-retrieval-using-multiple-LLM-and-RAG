Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it discusses the methodology and validation of the accuracy of fire risk maps. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
