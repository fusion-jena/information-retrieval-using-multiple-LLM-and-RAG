Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on training a Yolo model for fish detection, discussing the importance of providing bounding box data, using data augmentation, and tuning hyper-parameters. It does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
