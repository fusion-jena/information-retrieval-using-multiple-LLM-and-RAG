Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the classification algorithms used, hyperparameter tuning, and data allocation for training and testing. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
