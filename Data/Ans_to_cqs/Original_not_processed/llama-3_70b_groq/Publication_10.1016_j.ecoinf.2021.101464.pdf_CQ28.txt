Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. In fact, the context only mentions the use of R statistical software (Team RDC, 2010) for applying a random forest model, but it does not provide any information about the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for it.
