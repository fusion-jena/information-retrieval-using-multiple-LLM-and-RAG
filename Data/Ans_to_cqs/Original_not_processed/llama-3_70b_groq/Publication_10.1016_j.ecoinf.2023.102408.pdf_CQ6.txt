Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the model development, evaluation, and comparison of different machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, to improve the results of the ANN model. Additionally, the weights were randomly initialized using the Nguyen-Widrow method. But, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
