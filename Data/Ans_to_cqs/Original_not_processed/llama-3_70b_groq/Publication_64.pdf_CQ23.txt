Answer:::

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does provide some information about the dataset and data augmentation techniques used.

The dataset used for training the model is a subset of Google Image Search results, with 3680 labels (around 60% of all labels) having more than 12 images each. This suggests that the dataset is relatively diverse, but it is not clear if it is representative of the entire population of plant images.

During training, standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring are applied to the images. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting. However, it is not clear if other techniques such as rotation or flipping are also used.

The model is trained on a single dataset and evaluated on three different test datasets (Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist). This provides some indication of the model's ability to generalize to new datasets, but it is not a substitute for cross-validation or other techniques specifically designed to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while the dataset used is relatively diverse and data augmentation techniques are applied, the context does not provide explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
