Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, it is not a specific type of deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context only mentions that an ANN was implemented with two input nodes and one output node, but it does not provide further details about the architecture or type of ANN used.
