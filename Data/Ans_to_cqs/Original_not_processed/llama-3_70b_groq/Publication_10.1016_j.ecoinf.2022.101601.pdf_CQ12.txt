Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to permafrost and soil science, discussing various parameters and models used to study permafrost thaw and related ecological factors. There is no indication of the use of deep learning models in the pipeline.
