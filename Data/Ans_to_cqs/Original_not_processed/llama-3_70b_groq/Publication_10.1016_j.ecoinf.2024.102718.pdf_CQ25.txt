Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the BEiT model, is classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the model achieves an accuracy of 98.1% in the classification task, exceeding other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the context discusses the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, which are all metrics commonly used to evaluate classification models. Furthermore, the context mentions that the model is used to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy plant leaf images, which is a classic classification problem.
