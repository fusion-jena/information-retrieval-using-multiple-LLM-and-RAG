Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the evaluation of different models on the PAD Lite dataset, including their performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Computational Speed (CS), as well as their inference time and parameters. It also mentions the experimental settings used to evaluate the models, such as the batch size and GPU utilization. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
