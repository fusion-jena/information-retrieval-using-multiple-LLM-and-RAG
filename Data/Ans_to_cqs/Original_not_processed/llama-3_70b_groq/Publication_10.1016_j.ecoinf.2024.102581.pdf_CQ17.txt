Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the text as: "Dropout is used to help the model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and improve its generalizability." 

However, L2 regularization is not mentioned in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods might be used, but based on the given information, dropout is the only method explicitly mentioned.
