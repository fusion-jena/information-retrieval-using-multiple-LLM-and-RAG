Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the performance of the WT-HMM model with different dataset sizes, the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training, and the use of F1-score to evaluate model performance. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
