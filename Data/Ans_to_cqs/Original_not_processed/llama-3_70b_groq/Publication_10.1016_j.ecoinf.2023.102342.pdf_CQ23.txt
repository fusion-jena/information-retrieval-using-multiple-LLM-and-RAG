Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data acquisition, and processing, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their generalizability. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
