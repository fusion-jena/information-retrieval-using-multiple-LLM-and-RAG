Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the splitting ratio of the dataset, the characteristics of the deep learning models, and the hyperparameters used for training, but it does not provide information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
