Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include metrics calculation. The text mentions that "the resulting performance metrics are recorded" and "our proposed model shows notable differences in key metrics, including recognition accuracy and recall." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using certain metrics, such as recognition accuracy and recall, after the training process.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps in the provided context. It is possible that these steps may be involved, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, but it is unclear whether saliency maps or confusion matrix are also involved.
