Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, data augmentation, and experimental setup for satellite image classification. It discusses the training and validation accuracy of different models, including the proposed model, but does not delve into the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
