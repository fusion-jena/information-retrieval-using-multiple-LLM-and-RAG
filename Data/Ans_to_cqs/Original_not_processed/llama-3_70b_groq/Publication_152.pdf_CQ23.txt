Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the use of data augmentation, which can help improve the model's robustness to different image conditions, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

The context focuses on the application of the U-Net neural network for vegetation segmentation and identification, and it presents the results of the model's performance on a test set. However, it does not provide details on the dataset used for training and testing, such as its size, diversity, or splitting strategy. 

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
