Answer:::
The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study were early stopping and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. The dataset was randomly split into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing (validation set). The model weights were randomly initialized, and the training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set. This early stopping technique was employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalizability. However, there is no mention of using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting in this study.
