Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study that uses remote sensing data, specifically NDVI datasets, and discusses data sources, processing, and author contributions. There is no mention of deep learning, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
