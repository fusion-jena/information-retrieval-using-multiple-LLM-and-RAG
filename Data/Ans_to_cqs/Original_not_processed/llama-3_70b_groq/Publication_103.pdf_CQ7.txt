Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

For Herbarium255, the data was divided into 70% training data and 30% test data. This split was done by species, and within each species, the separation was done randomly.

For Herbarium1K, the data was divided into 80% training data and 20% test data. This split was also done by species, and within each species, the separation was done randomly. This proportion was chosen to keep the same proportion of data provided by the PC challenge.

No specific information is provided about the validation set, so it is unclear whether a validation set was used or how it was split.

It's worth noting that these splits are specific to the Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K datasets, and the criteria for splitting data may vary depending on the specific dataset and experiment.
