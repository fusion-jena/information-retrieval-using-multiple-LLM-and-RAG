Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing step, the proposed model, handling minority classes, performance metrics, and the results of the deep learning models. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
