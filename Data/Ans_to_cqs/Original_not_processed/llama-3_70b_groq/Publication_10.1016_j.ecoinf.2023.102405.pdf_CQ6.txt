Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability and integrity of data, and that it involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to enhance its quality and completeness.

In the context, it is mentioned that data cleansing is a significant aspect of preprocessing, where incomplete or inaccurate records are identified and removed to ensure the dataset's accuracy. This suggests that data cleaning is one of the preprocessing steps involved, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that data cleaning is one of the preprocessing steps involved, but we cannot determine if other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or others are involved.
