Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation and selection of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for a specific task, discussing aspects like model training, iteration numbers, and overfitting. 

While the context does mention the use of a specific configuration for the CNN model, including batch size and subdivisions, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
