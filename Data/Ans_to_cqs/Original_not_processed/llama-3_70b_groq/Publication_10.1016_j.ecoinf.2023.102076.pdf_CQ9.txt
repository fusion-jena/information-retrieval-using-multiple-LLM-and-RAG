Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the text classification pipeline, its design, and its application to a specific data collection scenario. It also references several research papers and studies, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
