Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models, specifically Maxent models, and their evaluation using metrics such as AICc, AUC, and TSS. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
