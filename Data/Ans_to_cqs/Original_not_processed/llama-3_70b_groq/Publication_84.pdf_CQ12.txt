Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a comparison experiment was conducted between SAE (Stacked Autoencoder) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) with six different types of Landsat images. This suggests that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE).
