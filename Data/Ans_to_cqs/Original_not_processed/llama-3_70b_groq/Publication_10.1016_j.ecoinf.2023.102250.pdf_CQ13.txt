Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, including the use of spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dynamic convolutional kernels. It also discusses the benefits of using these techniques, such as improved training stability and classification accuracy. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used to train the model.
