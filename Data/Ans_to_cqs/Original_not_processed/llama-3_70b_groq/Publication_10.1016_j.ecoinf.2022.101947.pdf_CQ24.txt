Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, random seed values, or any strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, discussing data validation, footprint trails, and population estimates. It does not provide any information about deep learning or randomness in a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
