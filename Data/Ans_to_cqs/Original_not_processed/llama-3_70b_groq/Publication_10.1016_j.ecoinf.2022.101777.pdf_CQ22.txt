Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Error of Commission (EC)
2. Error of Omission (EO)
3. Producer Accuracy (PA)
4. User Accuracy (UA)

These metrics are used to assess the reliability of the results and are computed based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment. 

Note that the context does not mention traditional deep learning metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. The mentioned metrics are more related to accuracy assessment in the context of land cover classification.
