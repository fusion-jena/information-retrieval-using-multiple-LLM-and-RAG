Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture of the EF network, the training setup, and the procedure to train SVMs filter bank, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The context only mentions that the buffer of both references was obtained by applying morphological dilation to the deforested polygons, and then a difference between the dilated and original images was performed to get the outer edge. However, this is not related to data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
