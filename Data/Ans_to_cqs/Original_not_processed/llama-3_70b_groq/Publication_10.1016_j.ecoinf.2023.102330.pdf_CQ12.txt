Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the context, where it is mentioned that "Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model" and "Our covey call acoustic CNN is trained to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note their associated time and peak power (dB)".
