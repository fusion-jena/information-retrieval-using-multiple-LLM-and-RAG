Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of different frontend methods (PCEN, log compression, and mel-spectrogram) and their effects on the performance of species recognition models. It discusses the importance of normalization and its impact on the models' performance, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
