Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. In fact, the text only mentions that training an image recognition model (e.g. deep learning) would be very useful if the methodology were extended to larger areas and/or more languages, but it does not provide any information about the hardware resources required or used for such training.
