Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the process of collecting and splitting samples into training and validation sets, as well as evaluating the performance of the classification model using metrics such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and confusion matrix. However, it does not provide information on how to determine when the training process should be stopped or what criteria are used to decide when the model has converged.
