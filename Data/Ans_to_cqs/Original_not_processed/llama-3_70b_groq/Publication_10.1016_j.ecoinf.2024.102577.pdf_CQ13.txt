Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a research article on machine learning and sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
