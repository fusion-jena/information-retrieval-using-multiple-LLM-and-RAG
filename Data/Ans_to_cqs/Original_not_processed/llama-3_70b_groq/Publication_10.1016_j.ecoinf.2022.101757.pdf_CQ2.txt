Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of open image datasets, semantic segmentation of images, and pixel-wise classification of photos, which suggests that image data is the primary format used.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of specific image datasets such as LUCAS images and North looking images, which further supports the idea that image data is the primary format used in the pipeline.

There is no mention of CSV data format being used in the pipeline, but it is possible that CSV files may be used to store metadata or annotations related to the images.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image data formats, with no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used.
