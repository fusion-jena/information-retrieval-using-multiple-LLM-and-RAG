Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, and it mentions the use of a Pleiades-1B satellite imagery dataset with a specific spatial resolution and spectral bands. Additionally, it mentions the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for LULC classification. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
