Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) are utilized for collecting raw data in the form of images in the field of ecology. These camera traps are used to non-invasively survey wildlife, resulting in a large volume of raw images that need to be reviewed and annotated. 

However, the context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline beyond camera traps in ecology. It does not mention surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
