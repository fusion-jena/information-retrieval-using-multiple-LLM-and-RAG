Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning methods, such as SVR and XGBoost, and their applications in predicting aboveground biomass and forest ecosystem services. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or strategies to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
