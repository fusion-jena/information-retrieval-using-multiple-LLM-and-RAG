Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific link to a data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) for the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that "A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of references", but it does not provide the actual link.
