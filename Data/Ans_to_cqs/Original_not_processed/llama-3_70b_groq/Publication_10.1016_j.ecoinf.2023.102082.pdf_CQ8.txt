Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used to derive the Lang10m dataset. It only mentions that the dataset was derived using a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) and Sentinel-2 optical images, but it does not provide any information about the code repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
