Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping with high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data, and presents the results of the study, including the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
