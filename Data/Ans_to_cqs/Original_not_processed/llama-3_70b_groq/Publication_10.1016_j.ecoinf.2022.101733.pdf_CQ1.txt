Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, as well as a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from AW3D30. The context does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does mention that researchers may be tempted to employ fewer sample points due to time and access constraints in croplands and other remote environments, which may force them to obtain training and validation sample points from imagery rather than field validation. This suggests that field surveys may be used in some cases, but it is not the primary method of data collection in this pipeline.
