Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process, the proposed approach, and the performance comparison with existing transfer learning approaches. It does not provide information on the dataset splitting strategy, cross-validation, or any other techniques used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
