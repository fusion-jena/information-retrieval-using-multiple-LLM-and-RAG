Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context focuses on the overall architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN), the classification model, and the risk threshold tuning process, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
