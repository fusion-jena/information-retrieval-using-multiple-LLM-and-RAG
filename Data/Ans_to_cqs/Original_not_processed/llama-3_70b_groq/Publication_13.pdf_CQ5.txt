Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used are custom datasets created for the specific task of image classification in the context of taxonomy. The datasets are referred to as GH, LH, and LL, which stand for Global High-quality, Local High-quality, and Local Low-quality datasets, respectively. These datasets consist of images of single-specimen photographs taken using different equipment and settings, with varying levels of image quality and resolution.
