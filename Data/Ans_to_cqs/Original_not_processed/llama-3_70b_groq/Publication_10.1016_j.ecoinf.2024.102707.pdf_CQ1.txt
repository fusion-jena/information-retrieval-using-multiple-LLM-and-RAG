Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of drone imagery and satellite images. This is evident from the references to studies that use drone flights over sub-Antarctic seabirds (Weimerskirch et al., 2018) and very high spatial resolution satellite images for detecting penguin guano (Witharana & Lynch, 2016). Additionally, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Antarctic environmental research is mentioned (Tovar-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2021).

It is also possible that surveys are used to collect data, as mentioned in the study by Shuford & Spear (1988) that conducted surveys of breeding penguins and other seabirds in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether sensors or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer on these specific methods.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to include drone imagery and satellite images, as well as possibly surveys. However, more information is needed to determine if sensors or public datasets are also used.
