Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the classification network, the experimental setup, and the comparison of different models, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
