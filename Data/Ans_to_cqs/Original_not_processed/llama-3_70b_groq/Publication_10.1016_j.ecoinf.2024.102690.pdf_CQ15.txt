Answer:::

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, as well as hotspot analysis for identifying ecological sources. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
