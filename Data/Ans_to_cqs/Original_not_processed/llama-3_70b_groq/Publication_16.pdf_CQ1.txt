Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of acoustic sensors. Specifically, a Samsung S10 is used to record garden birds and automatically upload the acquired audio to the platform for classification. This is mentioned in the section "Inferencing" where it is stated that "A Samsung S10 is used to record garden birds and automatically upload the acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for classification." Additionally, it is mentioned that the system can interface with a variety of sensors for real-time inference, suggesting that sensors are a key method for collecting raw data. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection.
