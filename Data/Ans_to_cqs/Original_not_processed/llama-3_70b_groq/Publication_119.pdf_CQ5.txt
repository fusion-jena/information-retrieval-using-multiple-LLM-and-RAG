Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. This is mentioned in the context as "the U-Net implemented within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet." This indicates that the model was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large dataset of images used for training and testing deep learning models. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the pipeline.
