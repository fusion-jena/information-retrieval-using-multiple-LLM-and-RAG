Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the context where the authors mention downloading 7362 images and using a ResNet34 model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture commonly used for image classification tasks. The authors also mention using data augmentation techniques such as flipping and zooming, which are typically applied to image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
