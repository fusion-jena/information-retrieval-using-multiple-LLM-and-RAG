Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are used for training deep learning models. This is evident from the text, which states that "the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine learning where the training phase can readily be parallelised and accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose." Additionally, the text mentions specific software tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which are commonly used for deep learning and are compatible with GPU acceleration. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in the provided context.
