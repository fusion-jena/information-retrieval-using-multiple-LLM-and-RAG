Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, the semantic segmentation model used to identify the substrate types achieved an accuracy of 92%. The precision for the vegetation class was 0.90, for the bare class was 0.96, and for the 'other' class was 0.50. The recall of the model reached 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and 0.53 for the 'other' class. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in identifying the correct substrate types.
