Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing model evaluation and effectiveness in correcting sampling bias, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
