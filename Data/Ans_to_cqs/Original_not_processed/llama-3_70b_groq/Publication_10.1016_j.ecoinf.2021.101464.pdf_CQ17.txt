Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing random forest models and their application to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and negative air ions. It mentions parameter optimization for the random forest model, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
