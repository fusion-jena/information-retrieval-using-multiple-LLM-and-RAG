Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the potential issues of data redundancy.

However, it does mention the use of "feature optimization tools" to address the issue of insufficient or excessive training samples, but it does not elaborate on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this context.
