Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides references to various studies and papers related to random forests, Sentinel-2 data, and habitat management, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
