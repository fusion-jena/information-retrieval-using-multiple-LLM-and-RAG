Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, with references to various papers and techniques used in the field. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
