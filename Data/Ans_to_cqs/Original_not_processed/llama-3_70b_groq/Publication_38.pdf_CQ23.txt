Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and a description of a CNNFAST network architecture, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it can be inferred that the model is designed for bat acoustic signal detection, and it is likely that the dataset used is related to this task. The context also mentions other studies and references related to deep learning and signal processing, but it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
