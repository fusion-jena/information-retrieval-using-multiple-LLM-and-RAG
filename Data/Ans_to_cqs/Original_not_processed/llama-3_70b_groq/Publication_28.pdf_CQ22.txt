Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score. These metrics are used to assess the classification outcomes of the PTDLEN-VAE model and other techniques on the UCM and AID datasets. The precision metric measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions made by the model. The recall metric measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances in the dataset. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. The F2-score is also used, which gives more weight to recall than precision. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in terms of its ability to correctly classify instances in the dataset.
