Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. There is no mention of deep learning or specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
