Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. It discusses the different classification algorithms used, such as k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, and random forest, and presents the results of their performance evaluation. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
