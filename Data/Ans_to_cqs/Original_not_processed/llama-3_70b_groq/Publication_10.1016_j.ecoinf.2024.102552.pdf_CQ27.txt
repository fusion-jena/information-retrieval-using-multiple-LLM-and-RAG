Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The text appears to be from a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the analysis of historical aerial images and the challenges of quantifying uncertainty in the results. It does mention the use of machine learning tools for image classification, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained model.
