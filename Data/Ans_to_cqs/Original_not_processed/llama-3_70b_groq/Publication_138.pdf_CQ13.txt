Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the ICSNet model, its comparison with other models, and the experimental results. It provides details about the layers, filters, strides, and activation functions used in the model, but it does not mention the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
