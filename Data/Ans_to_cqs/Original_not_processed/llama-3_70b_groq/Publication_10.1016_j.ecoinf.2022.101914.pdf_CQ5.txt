Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, where the authors are discussing the use of different modeling approaches, including regression-based models and machine learning models, to predict species presence. The datasets used in this study are not explicitly mentioned, but they seem to be related to species presence and background points. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
