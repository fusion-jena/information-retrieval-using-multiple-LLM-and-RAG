Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the need for feature optimization tools to refine the classification process. However, it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
