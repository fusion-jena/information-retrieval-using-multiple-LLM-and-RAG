Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, to estimate water quality parameters using satellite data. It discusses the advantages of machine learning algorithms, model performance assessment techniques, and hyperparameter tuning using randomized grid search. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
