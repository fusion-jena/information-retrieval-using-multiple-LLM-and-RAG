Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that audio data is used, as the context mentions "acoustic monitoring" and "birdsong identification software" such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite. Additionally, the context mentions "observer knowledge" and "data from the website eBird", which may suggest that CSV or other tabular data formats are used. However, there is no explicit mention of image or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
