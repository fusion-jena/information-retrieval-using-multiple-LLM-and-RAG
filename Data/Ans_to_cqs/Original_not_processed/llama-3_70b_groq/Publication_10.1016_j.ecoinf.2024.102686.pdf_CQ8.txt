Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be related to a research study on the Agro-Pastoral Ecotone (AEGC) in China, discussing geographic conditions, vegetation, and environmental data. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
