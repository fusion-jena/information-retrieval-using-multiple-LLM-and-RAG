Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in section 10.2.4, which discusses the use of a Convolutional NN (CNN) model for species distribution modeling. The architecture of the CNN model is also described in detail, including the number of hidden convolutional layers, kernel sizes, padding, and activation functions used.
