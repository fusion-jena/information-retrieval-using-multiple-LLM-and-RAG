Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of "deep convolutional neural networks" in the context, which are specifically designed to process images. Additionally, the context mentions image classification, object detection, and resizing images to a fixed size, which are all typical applications of CNNs. However, it is not explicitly stated in the context, so this answer is based on inference.
