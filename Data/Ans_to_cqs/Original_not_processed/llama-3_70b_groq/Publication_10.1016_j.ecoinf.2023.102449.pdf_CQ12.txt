Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the encoder and decoder architectures, which are set up as wide residual networks (ResNets) with convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions. The use of convolutional layers, downsampling blocks, and upsampling blocks further supports the conclusion that the model is a CNN. There is no mention of recurrent layers or self-attention mechanisms, which are characteristic of RNNs and Transformers, respectively.
