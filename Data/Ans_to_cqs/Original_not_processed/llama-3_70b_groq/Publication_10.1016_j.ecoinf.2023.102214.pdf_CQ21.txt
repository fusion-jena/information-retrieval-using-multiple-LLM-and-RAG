Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, overfitting, and data availability. It discusses the tuning of the number of required epochs, inspecting model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting, and the declaration of competing interests. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
