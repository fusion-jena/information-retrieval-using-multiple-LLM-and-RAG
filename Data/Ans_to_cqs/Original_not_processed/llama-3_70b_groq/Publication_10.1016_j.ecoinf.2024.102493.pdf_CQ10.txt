Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. It appears to be a snippet from a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing vegetation growth and its attribution to various latent variables. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
