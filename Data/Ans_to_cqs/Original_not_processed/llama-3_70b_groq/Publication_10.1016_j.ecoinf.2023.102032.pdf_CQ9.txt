Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of machine learning for cloud detection and wetland health assessment, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The context includes figures, tables, and keywords related to the research, but it does not mention specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the data repository based on the provided context.
