Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method and its application in wildlife conservation, as well as discussing imputation methods for handling missing values.

However, it does mention the use of machine learning-based methods, including tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF, which can be used to handle missing values and potentially mitigate data bias. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of collecting imperfect footprints and using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline to preserve valuable data and improve the accuracy of FIT predictions.

It does not provide information on specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
