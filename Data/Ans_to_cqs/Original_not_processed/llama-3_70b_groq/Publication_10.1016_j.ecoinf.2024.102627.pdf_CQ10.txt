Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. The text only discusses the methodology and results of the study, but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
