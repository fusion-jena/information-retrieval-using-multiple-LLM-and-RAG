Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a literature review or a research paper discussing various studies on plant species identification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It cites several research papers and studies, but does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link as it is not mentioned in the context.
