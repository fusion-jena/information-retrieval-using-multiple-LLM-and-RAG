Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) model, a regression tree method, for predicting invasive plant species richness and abundance, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
