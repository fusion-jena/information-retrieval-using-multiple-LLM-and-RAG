Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and their applications in animal behavior classification using ACC data. It also mentions ensemble machine learning and its advantages. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
