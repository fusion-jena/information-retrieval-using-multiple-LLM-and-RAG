Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The text discusses the leave-one-out cross-validation approach, the comparison of GEDI data with field data, and the construction of a regression model using Sentinel-2 spectral data. However, it does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others.
