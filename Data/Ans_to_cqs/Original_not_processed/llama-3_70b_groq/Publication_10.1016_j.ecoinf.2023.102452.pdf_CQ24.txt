Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on genetic programming, streamflow forecasting, and water quality management, with some references to deep learning approaches. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning approaches, such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, in streamflow forecasting. It also mentions the use of genetic programming for system identification of rainfall-runoff models. 

But, it does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in these deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
