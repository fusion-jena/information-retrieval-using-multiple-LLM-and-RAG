Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are as follows:

For PConv networks:
- Learning rate: 2e-4
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer
- Loss function: per-pixel loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and total variation loss
- Batch size: 1
- Epochs: 50
- Pre-trained network: Pre-trained on ImageNet

For Pix2Pix networks:
- Learning rate: 9e-5
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer
- Loss function: Adversarial loss and L1 loss
- Batch size: 1
- Epochs: Not specified
- Pre-trained network: Not specified

For Classification networks:
- Learning rate: 0.03
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer
- Loss function: Cross-entropy loss
- Batch size: 32
- Epochs: 20
- Pre-trained network: Pre-trained on ImageNet (VGG16)

Note that some hyperparameters are not specified for Pix2Pix networks.
