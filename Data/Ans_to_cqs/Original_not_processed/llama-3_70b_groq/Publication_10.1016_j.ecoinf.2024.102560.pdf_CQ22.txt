Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics. The text discusses the use of precipitation datasets, Landsat satellite images, and a salinity index (SI) to investigate water surface area and salinity variations. It also mentions the use of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for drought detection and evaluation criteria such as the Correlation Coefficient (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for drought modeling. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics.
