Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It only mentions that the NGEE Tropics project uses a data repository called the NGEE Tropics Archive, which allows users to upload and access data packages via a web portal. However, it does not provide a direct link to this repository.
