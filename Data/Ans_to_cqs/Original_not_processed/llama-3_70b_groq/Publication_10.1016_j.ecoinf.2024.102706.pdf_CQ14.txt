Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This is mentioned in the text as: "Additionally, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python packages." This indicates that the hyperparameters are optimized using a grid search approach, where the model is trained and evaluated on different combinations of hyperparameters, and the best combination is selected based on the performance on the validation set.
