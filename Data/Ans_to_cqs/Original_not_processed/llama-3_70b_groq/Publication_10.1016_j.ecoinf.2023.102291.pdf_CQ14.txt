Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the data collection, segmentation, and spectrogram creation process, as well as presents some experimental results, but it does not discuss hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
