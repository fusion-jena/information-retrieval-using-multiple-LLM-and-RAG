Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on hyperparameter tuning using k-fold cross-validation and grid search, as well as the issue of overfitting in machine learning models. It does not discuss the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
