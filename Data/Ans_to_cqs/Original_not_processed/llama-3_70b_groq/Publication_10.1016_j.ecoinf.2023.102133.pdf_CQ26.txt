Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on ensemble learning methods, such as bagging and random forests, which are used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. 

However, it does mention that the dataset has missing values, and neural network models are used for gap-filling. This implies that the authors are aware of the issue of missing data, but it does not provide information on how they address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
