Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the proposed model EMViT-Net is trained for 100 epochs with optimizer AdamW and the activation function GELU. It also provides the loss and accuracy curves of the reported network in Fig. 5, which represents training and validation accuracy with their corresponding loss for the proposed model EMViT-Net. 

However, it can be inferred that the training process might have been stopped after 100 epochs, but the exact criteria for stopping the training process are not specified. It is common in deep learning to stop training when the validation loss plateaus or when a certain number of epochs have been reached, but this information is not provided in the given context.
