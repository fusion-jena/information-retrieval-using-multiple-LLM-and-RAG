Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to atmospheric correction algorithms for remote sensing reflectance in plateau lakes, and it discusses the C2RCC processor and L2gen algorithm. It does not provide information about model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
