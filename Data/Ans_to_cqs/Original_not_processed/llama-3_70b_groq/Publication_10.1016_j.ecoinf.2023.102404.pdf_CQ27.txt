Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model. It discusses the optimization of a random forest (RF) model's hyperparameters using a grid search approach, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. The context focuses on the model's training and hyperparameter tuning process, but it does not cover the deployment stage. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
