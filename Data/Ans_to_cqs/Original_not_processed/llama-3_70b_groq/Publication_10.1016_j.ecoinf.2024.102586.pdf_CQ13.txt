Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to describe a statistical analysis or modeling approach, but it does not involve deep learning. The context discusses predictor variables, response variables, and model evaluation metrics, but it does not mention learning rates, optimizers, or other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
