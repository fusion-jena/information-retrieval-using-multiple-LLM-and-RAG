Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Mask R-CNN model, which is a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, it is a combination of Faster R-CNN and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with some advancements. The model uses ResNet 50 and ResNet 101 as backbone structures, and it is trained on a dataset of images with a fixed width and height of 640 pixels. The model is used for instance segmentation tasks, where it predicts both the class label and the mask for each instance in the image.
