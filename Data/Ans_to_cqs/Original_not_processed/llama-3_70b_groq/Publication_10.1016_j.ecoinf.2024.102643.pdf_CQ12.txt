Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context lists various machine learning models and algorithms, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), and others, but it does not specify a deep learning model used in a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
