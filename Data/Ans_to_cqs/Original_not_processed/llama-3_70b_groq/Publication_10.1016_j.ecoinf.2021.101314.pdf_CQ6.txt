Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are queries that describe a set of localities, and filtering them based on accuracy and complexity. It does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
