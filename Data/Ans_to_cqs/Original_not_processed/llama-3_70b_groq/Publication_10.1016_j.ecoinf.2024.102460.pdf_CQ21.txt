Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to land use modeling, optimization, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved in the model training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
