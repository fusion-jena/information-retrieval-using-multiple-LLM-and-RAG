Answer:::

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to landscape design and restorative potential assessment, and it does not discuss machine learning model training or postprocessing steps.

The context mentions steps such as modifying the landscape design, assessing restorative potential, and iterating on the design process, but it does not provide information on model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
