Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the limitations and challenges of using maps as information resources, particularly in the context of ecological informatics and scientific communication. It discusses the imperfections of map representations, the potential impact of color blindness on interpreting maps, and the importance of considering these limitations in scientific studies.

There is no mention of deep learning pipelines, surveys, sensors, or public datasets in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given information.
