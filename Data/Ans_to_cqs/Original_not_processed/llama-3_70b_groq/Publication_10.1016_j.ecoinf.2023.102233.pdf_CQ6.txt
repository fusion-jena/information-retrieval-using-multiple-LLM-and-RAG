Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the active learning approach, CNN model development, and data collection, but it does not provide details on data preprocessing.

However, it is common in deep learning applications to perform certain preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to prepare the data for model training. These steps can help improve the model's performance and prevent issues like feature dominance or outliers.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
