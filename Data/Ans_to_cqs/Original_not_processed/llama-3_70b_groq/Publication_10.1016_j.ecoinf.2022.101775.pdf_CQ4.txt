Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on matrix factorization, deep learning, and neural networks, particularly in the context of natural language processing and collaborative filtering. It discusses the use of embedding layers, stochastic gradient descent, and Adam optimization algorithm, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
