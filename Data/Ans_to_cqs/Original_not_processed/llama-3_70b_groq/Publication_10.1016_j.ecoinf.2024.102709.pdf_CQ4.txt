Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions image preprocessing using Python with the OpenCV library, which involves image inversion (switching white pixels to black and vice versa). It does not provide information on any additional data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
