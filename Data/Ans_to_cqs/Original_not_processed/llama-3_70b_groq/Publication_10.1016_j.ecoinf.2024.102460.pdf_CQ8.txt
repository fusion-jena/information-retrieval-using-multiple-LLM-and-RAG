Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide a link to a specific repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article, and it does not include information about the code used in the study. The "Data availability" section states that "Data will be made available on request," but it does not mention the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
