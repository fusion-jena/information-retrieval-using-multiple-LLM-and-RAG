Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and support vector machines, in the supervised learning of animal behavior based on ACC data. It also discusses the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches in behavioral studies. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps required for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
