Answer: According to the provided context, the data is split into training and validation sets with an 80/20% split for each class. This means that 80% of the data is used for training and 20% is used for validation. Additionally, a separate test set is created, which contains 500 segments, with 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The distribution of target features to non-target features in the test set is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation.
