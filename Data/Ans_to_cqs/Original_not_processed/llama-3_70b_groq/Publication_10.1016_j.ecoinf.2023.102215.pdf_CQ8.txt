Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the architecture and training of a deep learning model called TrunkNet, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository.
