Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from optical imagery datasets, specifically from deep-sea images. The context mentions "the increasing availability of optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps" which suggests that the data is collected through optical imaging techniques, possibly from cameras or other sensors deployed in deep-sea environments.

It is also possible that the data is collected from public datasets, as the context mentions "large-scale temporal habitat maps" which could be publicly available datasets. However, the specific methods of data collection, such as surveys or sensors, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer is that the raw data is likely collected from optical imagery datasets, possibly from public datasets, but the specific methods of data collection are not specified.
