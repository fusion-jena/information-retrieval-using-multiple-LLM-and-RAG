Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and land use and land cover analysis, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
