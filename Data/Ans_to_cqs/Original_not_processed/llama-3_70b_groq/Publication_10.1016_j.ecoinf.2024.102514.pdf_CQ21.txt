Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the data splitting, model selection, and performance evaluation of various machine learning algorithms. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the context mentions the calculation of various performance metrics such as R2, NSE, MEF, Z, Taylor statistics, RMSE, MAE, and EN. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models during the training and testing periods. 

Additionally, the context does not mention the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps are involved in the study. 

In summary, the only postprocessing step that can be inferred from the context is the calculation of various performance metrics. Other postprocessing steps, such as the creation of saliency maps or confusion matrices, are not mentioned.
