Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the results can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in the preferred raster format for the region of interest. This suggests that the output of the pipeline is likely in a raster format, such as GeoTIFF or similar. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2A scenes, which are typically provided in raster format. The pipeline also uses individual bands from these scenes as inputs, which further supports the idea that the data format used is raster-based.

However, it is not possible to determine the exact data format used in the pipeline (e.g., image, CSV, etc.) based on the provided context.
