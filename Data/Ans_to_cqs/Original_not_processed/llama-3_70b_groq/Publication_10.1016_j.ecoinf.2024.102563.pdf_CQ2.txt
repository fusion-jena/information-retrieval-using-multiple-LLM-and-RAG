Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to remote sensing and image analysis. There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats. However, it can be inferred that image data formats are used, as the context mentions remote sensing data, digital image processing, and image classification.

Specifically, the context mentions the use of multisource remote sensing data, Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery, and GF-1 remote sensing data. These data formats are likely to be in the form of raster images or multidimensional arrays.

Additionally, the context mentions the extraction of textural features, spectral features, and other image-derived features, which suggests that the data formats used are related to image data.

There is no mention of CSV data formats in the context, which are typically used for tabular data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to be image-related formats, such as raster images or multidimensional arrays.
