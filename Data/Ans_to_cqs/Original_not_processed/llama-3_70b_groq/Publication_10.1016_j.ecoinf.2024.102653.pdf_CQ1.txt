Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the study uses honey bee flight activity data, but it does not specify how this data was collected. It is possible that the data was collected using sensors, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
