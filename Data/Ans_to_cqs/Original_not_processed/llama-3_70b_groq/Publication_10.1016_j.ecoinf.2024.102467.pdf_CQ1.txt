Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and authorship contributions related to various topics, including deep learning, computer vision, and aquaculture. There is no specific information about data collection methods, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

However, it can be inferred that some of the references might be related to data collection methods, such as the paper on "Bioecology of macrobenthic communities in the microtidal monsoonal Kodungallurâ€“Azhikode Estuary, southwest coast of India" which might involve surveys or sensor data. Similarly, the paper on "Underwater holothurian target detection algorithm" might involve the use of sensors or cameras for data collection.

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
