Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It lists various abbreviations and techniques related to data analysis and machine learning, including RF (random forest), CNN (convolutional neural network), and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), but it does not provide information about the specific framework used to build a deep learning model.
