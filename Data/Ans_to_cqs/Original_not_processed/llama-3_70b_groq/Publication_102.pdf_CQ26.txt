Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the models, including the contracting and expansive paths, loss functions, and optimization techniques. It also discusses the performance of the models on different datasets. However, it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
