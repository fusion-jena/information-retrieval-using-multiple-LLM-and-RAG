Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of a Bayesian optimizer in the proposed FAA-based approach (Fig. 3) to control the output of each CNN and evaluate the optimal augment policies. 

It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
