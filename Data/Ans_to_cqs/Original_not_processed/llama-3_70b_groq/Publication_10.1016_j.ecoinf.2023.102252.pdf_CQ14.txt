Answer::: 

The hyperparameters of the model (FERM) are optimized using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method. This method is used to fit parameters by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. There is no mention of grid search or random search being used for hyperparameter optimization in the provided context.
