Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the DeepLabV3+ model are provided in Table 1. The learning policy is Poly, which is a polynomial learning rate schedule. The base learning rate is 0.0001, and the learning rate decay factor is 0.1. The learning rate decay step is 2000, and the learning power is 0.9. The training number of steps is greater than or equal to 100,000. The momentum is 0.9, and the train batch size is 2. The weight decay is 0.00004, and the train crop size is 513x513. The last layer gradient multiplier is 1, and upsample logits is True. The drop path keep prob is 1, and the tf_initial_checkpoint is deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug. Other hyperparameters include initialize_last_layer=False, last_layers_contain_logits_only=True, slow_start_step=0, slow_start_learning_rate=1e-4, fine_tune_batch_norm=False, min_scale_factor=0.5, max_scale_factor=2, scale_factor_step_size=0.25, atrous_rates=[6,12,18], and output_stride=16.
