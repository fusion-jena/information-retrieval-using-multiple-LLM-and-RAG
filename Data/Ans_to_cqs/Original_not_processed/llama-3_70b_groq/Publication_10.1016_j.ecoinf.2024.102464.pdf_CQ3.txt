Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and urban development, with references to machine learning models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). There is no mention of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
