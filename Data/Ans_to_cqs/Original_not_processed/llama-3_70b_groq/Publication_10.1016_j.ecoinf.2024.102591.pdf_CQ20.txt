Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform for high-performance computing, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources used for training the model. GEE is a cloud-based platform, and it is likely that it uses a distributed computing architecture with multiple machines, but the specific hardware resources used are not mentioned.
