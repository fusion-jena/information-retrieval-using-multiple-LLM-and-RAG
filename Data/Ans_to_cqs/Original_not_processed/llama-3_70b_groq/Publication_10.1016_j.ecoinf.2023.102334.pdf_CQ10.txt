Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing various deep learning models and techniques, including DenseNet, ViT, and Transformer, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
