Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the importance of independent samples for validating map predictions, cross-validation techniques, and bagging methods to handle spatial autocorrelation and non-independent data observations.

However, it does mention that cross-validation can be configured in multiple ways, and one common approach is to partition the data into k different subsets, or "folds", each of which is held out in turn as test data while the model is trained using the other k-1 folds. This implies that the data is split into training and testing sets, but the specific criteria for this split are not mentioned.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and time-series splitting, among others. But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, and more information would be needed to determine the specific approach used.
