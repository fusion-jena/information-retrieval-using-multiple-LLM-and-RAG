Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, or any other datasets commonly used in deep learning. The context appears to be related to metadata reporting and data management in earth system science, with references to Unidata, USGS Science data catalog, and a research paper on ecosystem model-data synthesis. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
