Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to data management and metadata templates for a specific project or dataset, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that sensors might be used for data collection, as there are references to "Sensor_FieldName" and "Equipment" lists that include sensor information. Additionally, the presence of "E-Field_Log" and "Field_Event_Log" templates suggests that data might be collected through field measurements or experiments. But, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

It is also important to note that the context does not mention deep learning pipelines or surveys as a method of data collection. Therefore, it is unclear how the data is being used or processed for deep learning applications.
