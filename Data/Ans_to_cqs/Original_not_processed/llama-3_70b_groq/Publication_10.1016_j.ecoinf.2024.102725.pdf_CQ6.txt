Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on NDVI reconstruction, vegetation cover study, and crop phenology detection using various techniques such as harmonic analysis, Savitzky-Golay filter, and generative adversarial networks. 

However, it can be inferred that the preprocessing steps might involve handling missing data, cloud removal, and normalization, as these are common issues addressed in the context of NDVI reconstruction and remote sensing data. For instance, the SOWCEM technology framework is used to reconstruct cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets, which implies that cloud removal might be a preprocessing step. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial and temporal dimensions. This might involve some form of normalization or scaling. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
