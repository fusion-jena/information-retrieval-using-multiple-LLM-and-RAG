Answer: The context mentions that the processing speed of MegaDetector is dependent on the hardware it is run on, and specifically mentions 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs as an example of specialized hardware used to process approximately 3.8 million images/day. However, it does not explicitly state that these GPUs were used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I can only infer that NVIDIA V100 GPUs are used for processing images with MegaDetector, but I don't know for certain if they were used for training the model.
