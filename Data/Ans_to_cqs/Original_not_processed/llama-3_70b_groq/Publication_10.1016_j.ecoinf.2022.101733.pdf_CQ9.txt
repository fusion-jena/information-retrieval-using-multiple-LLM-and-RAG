Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. It discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform for processing big geospatial data, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The context focuses on the advantages of using GEE, the development of an algorithm on GEE, and the collection of training and validation samples, but it does not mention a specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
