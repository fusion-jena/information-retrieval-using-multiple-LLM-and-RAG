Answer:::

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to discuss species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size and sampling bias on their performance. It mentions various approaches to correct for sampling bias, such as transforming the model input data, but does not mention deep learning models or techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
