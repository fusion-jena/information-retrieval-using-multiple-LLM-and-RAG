Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, object-oriented classification, and data processing, but it does not provide information about the deep learning frameworks used. The references cited are related to object detection, semantic segmentation, and classification, but they do not specify the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
