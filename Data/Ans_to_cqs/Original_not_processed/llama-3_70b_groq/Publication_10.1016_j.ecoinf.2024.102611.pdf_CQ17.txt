Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for plant species classification and disease detection, but it does not delve into the specific regularization techniques used.

However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent with batch updates and hyperparameter tuning in one of the studies (Barhate et al., 2023). This suggests that the authors may have employed some form of regularization, but the specific method is not mentioned.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. However, without explicit mention in the context, it is impossible to determine which specific method was used in these studies.
