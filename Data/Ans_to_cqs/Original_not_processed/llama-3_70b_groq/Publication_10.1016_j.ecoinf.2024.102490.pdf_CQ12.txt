Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer being used in the pipeline. The context mentions various statistical and machine learning models such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, GLM, GAM, SER, FDA, ANN, GBM, RF, MaxEnt, MARS, and MaxNet, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
