Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the Wav2Vec model, including the feature encoder, context network, and fine-tuning phase. It also mentions the use of transfer learning and the effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying bird species based on their calls. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
