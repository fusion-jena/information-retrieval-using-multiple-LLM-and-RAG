Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of random forest and deep learning models, explaining the statistical feature importance test, and discussing the training process of the deep learning model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of dropout as a technique to prevent neural networks from overfitting (Reference 66). Dropout can be seen as a way to introduce randomness in the network during training, but it is not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This is not mentioned in the provided context, but it is a common strategy employed in deep learning pipelines.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a specific strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
