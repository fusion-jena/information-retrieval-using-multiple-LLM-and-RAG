Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, top-3 accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recall, as shown in Table 2. Additionally, the context mentions the creation of confusion matrices, as depicted in Fig. 4, which shows the confusion matrices of the base and the best configuration for each frontend. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step. It is possible that other postprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
