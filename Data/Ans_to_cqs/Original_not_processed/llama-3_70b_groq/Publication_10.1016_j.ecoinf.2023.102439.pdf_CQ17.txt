Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in modeling studies, particularly in land use land cover change detection and urban sprawl prediction. It discusses the use of hybrid models combining wavelet analysis and NARX ANN algorithms to enhance the performance of ANN models. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

The only mention of overfitting is in the context of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, where it is stated that excessive neurons may lead to overfitting and compromise the network's performance. However, no specific regularization methods are mentioned to address this issue.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
