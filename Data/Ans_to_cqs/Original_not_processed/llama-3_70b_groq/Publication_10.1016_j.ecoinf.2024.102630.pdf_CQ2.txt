Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, and their sources, such as MODIS, AVHRR, and SPOT/VEGETATION. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different NDVI products and their suitability for specific research needs.

There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline, such as image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
