Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, there is no mention of specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. In fact, one of the advantages of using TensorFlow mentioned in the text is that it eliminates the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. The authors compared TensorFlow's classification performance based on cleaned and raw images for the Mexican species and found that preprocessing was not necessary. Therefore, it can be inferred that no preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning model in this specific project.
