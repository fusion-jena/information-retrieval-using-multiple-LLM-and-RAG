Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through a combination of in-situ EC (Electrical Conductivity) measurements and remote sensing. The article mentions "in-situ EC measurements" and "remote sensing" as part of the experimental design flow chart (Fig. 5). This suggests that the raw data is collected through these two methods. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used. Therefore, it can be concluded that in-situ EC measurements and remote sensing are the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
