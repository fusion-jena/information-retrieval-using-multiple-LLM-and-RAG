Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions a CNN architecture and references to image classification, which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, the context mentions a dataset called VnPollenBee, which likely contains images of bees.

There is also a mention of audio beehive monitoring and references to papers that use audio samples for classification, which suggests that audio data may also be used in some part of the pipeline.

There is no mention of video data or CSV files being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image and audio data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
