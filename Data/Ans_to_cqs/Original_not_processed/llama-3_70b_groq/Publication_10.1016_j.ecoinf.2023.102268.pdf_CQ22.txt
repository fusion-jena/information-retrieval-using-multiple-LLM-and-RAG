Answer: 

According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and precision. 

The accuracy is defined as the model's ability to detect both classes, and it is calculated as follows: accuracy = [TP + TN]/N, where TP and TN refer to the number of true positive and true negative detections, respectively, and N is the total number of signals.

The precision is defined as the model's ability to classify boatwhistle calls, and it is calculated as follows: precision = TP/[TP + FP], where TP and FP refer to the number of true and false positive detections, respectively.

There is no mention of recall in the provided context.
