Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on river health predictions, machine learning, and bias-variance decomposition, but it does not delve into specific regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention deep learning and machine learning models, which often employ regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Common regularization methods include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation, among others. But these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
