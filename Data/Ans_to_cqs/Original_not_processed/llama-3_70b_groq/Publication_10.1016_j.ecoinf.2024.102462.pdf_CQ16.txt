Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text explains the general process of training a deep learning (DL) network, including the use of annotated data and the evaluation of the network on an independent testing data set. However, it does not provide specific details on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence of parameters, or a certain number of epochs.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
