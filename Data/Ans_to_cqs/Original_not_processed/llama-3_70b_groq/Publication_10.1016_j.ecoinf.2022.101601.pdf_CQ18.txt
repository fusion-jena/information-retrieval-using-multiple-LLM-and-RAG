Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers and a table comparing different models based on their input parameters. There is no information about model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
