Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The texts appear to be related to soil science, irrigation, and ecology, but they do not discuss machine learning models or optimization techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of a model are optimized based on the provided context.
