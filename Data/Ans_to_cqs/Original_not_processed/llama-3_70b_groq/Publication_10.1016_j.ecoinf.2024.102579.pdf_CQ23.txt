Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, nor does it discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to be discussing estimators for diversity indices in forest inventories, specifically in the context of relascope sampling. It presents results from simulations and discusses the performance of different estimators, but it does not mention deep learning or any of the measures you mentioned (diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting).
