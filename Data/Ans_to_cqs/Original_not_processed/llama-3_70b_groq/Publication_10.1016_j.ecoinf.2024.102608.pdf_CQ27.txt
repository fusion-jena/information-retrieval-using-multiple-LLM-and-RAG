Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the selection of hyperparameter values for machine learning models using randomized grid search methods, model performance assessment techniques, and the characteristics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
