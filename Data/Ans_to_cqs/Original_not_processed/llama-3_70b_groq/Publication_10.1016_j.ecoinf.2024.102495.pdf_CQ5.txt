Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses the optimization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model for feature extraction and classification. However, it does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in image classification tasks. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
