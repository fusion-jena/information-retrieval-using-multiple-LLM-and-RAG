Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite imagery. The text mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, which is a typical application of deep learning in computer vision. Additionally, the context mentions the use of high-resolution remote sensing images, MODIS NDVI, and RapidEye data, which are all types of image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store metadata or feature data associated with the images, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
