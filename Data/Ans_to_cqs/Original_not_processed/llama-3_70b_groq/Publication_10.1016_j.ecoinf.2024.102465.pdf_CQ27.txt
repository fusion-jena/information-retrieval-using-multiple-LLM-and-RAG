Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the HRNet model used for semantic segmentation, the LSTM-CNN model used for sentiment analysis, and the formulas used to calculate various indicators such as greenness, openness, and sky openness index. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
