Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on a specific study using deep learning for semantic segmentation of high-resolution images in a Brazilian Amazon forest, and it discusses the methodology, results, and conclusions of the study.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of an optimizer, RMSprop, with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, and the training of the network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. These hyperparameters may have some impact on the randomness in the deep learning pipeline, but the context does not provide further information on how randomness is handled.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting, and employing ensemble methods to average out random variations. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
