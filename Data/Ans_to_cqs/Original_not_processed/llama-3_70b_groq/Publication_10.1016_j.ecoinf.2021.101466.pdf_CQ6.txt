Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the same image processing as the data augmentation for YOLOv4 was applied to the foreground, background, and combined images for the data augmentation employed to train the EfficientNet. 

Additionally, the context describes a data augmentation method that involves combining a masked foreground image with a background image that does not contain any insects, and applying random erasing to the training dataset of the EfficientNet. 

It can be inferred that some form of image processing or preprocessing might have been involved in the data augmentation step, but the specific steps are not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
