Answer:::
Answer: The context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only provides information about the operating system (CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908), development environment (Python 3.6.2 with TensorFlow 1.12.0 and Numpy 1.19.2), and computational resources (32 CPUs with 64 processors each). There is no mention of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
