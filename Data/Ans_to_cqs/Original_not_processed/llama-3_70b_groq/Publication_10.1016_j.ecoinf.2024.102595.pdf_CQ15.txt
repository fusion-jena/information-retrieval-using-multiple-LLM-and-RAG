Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. It only mentions that hyper-parameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10), but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
