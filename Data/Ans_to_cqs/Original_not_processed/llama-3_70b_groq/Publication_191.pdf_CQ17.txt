Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on discussing the limitations of existing plant datasets for training deep CNN networks and exploring the local responses of individual filters in each convolution layer. It also presents some experimental results on plant classification tasks using different feature extractors and classifiers.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
