Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of machine learning to aid sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide details on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the study uses historical catch and bycatch data, as well as environmental data, to train the machine learning models. The environmental data includes variables such as current speed, temperature, sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, and others. It is likely that these data are collected through a combination of sources, including sensors, surveys, and public datasets. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting the raw data.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
