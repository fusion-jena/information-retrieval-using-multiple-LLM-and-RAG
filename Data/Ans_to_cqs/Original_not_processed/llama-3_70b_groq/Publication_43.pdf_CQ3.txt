Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the training of a CNN classifier for mapping Ziziphus lotus shrubs, including the loss function, optimization method, and dataset composition. It does not provide information on how the data was annotated.

However, based on the fact that the dataset consists of 80x80-pixel image patches labeled as either Ziziphus lotus shrubs or Bare soil with sparse vegetation, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used might be image-level classification, where each image patch is assigned a class label. There is no indication of more complex annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation being used.
