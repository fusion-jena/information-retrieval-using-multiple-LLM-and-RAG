Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the data pre-processing, machine learning models, and conclusions of a research study, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. The context mentions references to other studies, such as Casillas-Garc√≠a et al. (2021) and Abba et al. (2020), but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
