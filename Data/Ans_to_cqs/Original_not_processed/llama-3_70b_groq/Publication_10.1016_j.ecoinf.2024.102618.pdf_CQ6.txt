Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are:

1. Balancing the dataset using the class-weighted technique: This step is important to solve the bias towards classes with a large number of images.
2. A novel image pre-processing technique: Although the details of this technique are not specified, it is mentioned as a step in the methodology.

No other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
