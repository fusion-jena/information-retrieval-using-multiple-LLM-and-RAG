Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is working with image data. There is no explicit mention of the data format, but the context suggests that the input data is image-based, as it mentions convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and image tiles. Additionally, the figures shown in the context, such as Figure 12, Figure 20, and others, appear to be image-based outputs. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
