Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is convergence within a certain number of epochs. Specifically, it is mentioned that "Inceptionv3 converges by 400 epochs, while the other networks converge within 150 epochs." This suggests that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or reaches a plateau, which is a common criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it is not explicitly stated in the text what specific metric or threshold is used to determine convergence.
