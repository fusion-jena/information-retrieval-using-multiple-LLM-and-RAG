Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data resampling is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the text mentions that "we used data resampling in training a new model" to compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data. This suggests that resampling is used to balance the data distribution and mitigate the negative impact of imbalanced data on CNN models.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. It is possible that these techniques may be used in other contexts or studies, but they are not mentioned in this specific text.

Therefore, the answer is that data resampling is used to address data bias, but the context does not provide information on other techniques.
