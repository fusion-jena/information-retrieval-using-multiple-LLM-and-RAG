Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the DeepLabV3+ algorithm for semantic segmentation, image cropping, and data augmentation techniques such as flipping, exchanging image channels, rotating, and adding noise to the images. However, it does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
