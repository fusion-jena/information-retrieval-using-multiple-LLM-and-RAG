Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to describe a hybrid algorithm that combines a least squares (LS) algorithm with a genetic algorithm (GA) and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for parameter estimation. It does not discuss deep learning or data preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
