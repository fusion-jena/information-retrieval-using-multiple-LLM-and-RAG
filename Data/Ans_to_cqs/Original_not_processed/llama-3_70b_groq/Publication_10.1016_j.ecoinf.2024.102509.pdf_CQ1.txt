Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that various methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

One method mentioned is the use of remote sensing, as seen in the studies by Yang et al. (2018), Byrd et al. (2014), and Bunting et al. (2018). Remote sensing involves collecting data through sensors or cameras mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones. This method is useful for collecting data over large areas, such as grasslands or mangrove forests.

Another method mentioned is the use of sensors, as seen in the study by Byrd et al. (2014). This study evaluated the use of different sensor types for mapping biomass of coastal marsh emergent vegetation.

Public datasets are also utilized, as seen in the World Agroforestry Centre databases (2011). These databases provide access to a wide range of data related to agroforestry, which can be used as input for deep learning models.

Surveys are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they may be used in conjunction with other methods to collect data. For example, surveys could be used to collect ground truth data to validate the accuracy of remote sensing or sensor-based data.

It is likely that other methods, such as field measurements or experiments, may also be used to collect raw data, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
