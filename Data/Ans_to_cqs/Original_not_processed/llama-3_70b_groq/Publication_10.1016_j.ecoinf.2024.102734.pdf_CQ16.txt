Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that model prototypes are updated automatically and the user can trigger model training and view training metrics through the training tab, but it does not specify the conditions for stopping the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
