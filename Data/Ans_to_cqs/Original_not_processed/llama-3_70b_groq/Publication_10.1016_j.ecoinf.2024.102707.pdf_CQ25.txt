Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context varies, but it can be inferred from the titles and descriptions of the papers. 

In the paper "A convolutional neural network architecture designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies" by Le et al. (2022), the purpose of the deep learning model is likely detection or counting of seabirds.

In the paper "Towards efficient machine learning methods for penguin counting" by Liu et al. (2020), the purpose of the deep learning model is penguin counting.

In the paper "An object-based image analysis approach for detecting penguin guano in very high spatial resolution satellite images" by Witharana and Lynch (2016), the purpose of the deep learning model is detection of penguin guano.

In the paper "Do you get what you see? Insights of using mAP to select architectures of pretrained neural networks for automated aerial animal detection" by Moreni et al. (2023), the purpose of the deep learning model is automated aerial animal detection.

In the paper "Wild animal survey using UAS imagery and deep learning: modified faster R-CNN for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau" by Peng et al. (2020), the purpose of the deep learning model is kiang detection.

In general, the deep learning models mentioned in the context are primarily used for object detection, counting, or classification in the context of remote sensing and wildlife surveys.
