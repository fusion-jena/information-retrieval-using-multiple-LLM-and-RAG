Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used to expand the training dataset, which includes:

* Random adjustments to image size
* Image flipping
* Cropping
* Conversion

These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, except for the data augmentation techniques mentioned.
