Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and agricultural applications, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
