Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used to recognize and classify endemic bird species. The model is trained on a dataset of images of birds and learns to extract features that are relevant for distinguishing between different species. The goal is to improve the learning of the target predictive function fT (Â·) in the target domain DT, which is the classification of new endemic bird species. The model is not used for segmentation, which involves identifying specific parts or regions within an image, nor is it used for detection, which involves locating specific objects within an image. The focus is on classifying the bird species as a whole.
