Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the encoder and decoder, the pre-processing block, and the auto-encoding process. It discusses the use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and residual blocks, but does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
