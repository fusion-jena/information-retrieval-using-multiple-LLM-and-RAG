Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to limited training data and the need for large datasets. It also touches on semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning as potential approaches to address data limitations. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
