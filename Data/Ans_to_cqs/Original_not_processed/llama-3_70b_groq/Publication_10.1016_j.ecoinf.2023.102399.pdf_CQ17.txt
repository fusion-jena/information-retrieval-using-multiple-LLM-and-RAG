Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques in aquaculture, particularly for biomass estimation and fish length/weight estimation. It discusses various studies and techniques used for image processing and analysis, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
