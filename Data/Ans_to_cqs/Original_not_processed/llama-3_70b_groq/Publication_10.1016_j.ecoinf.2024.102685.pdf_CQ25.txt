Answer: The purpose of the Random Forest model (not deep learning model) is classification. Specifically, it is used to classify the presence or absence of seagrass meadows in the lagoon. The model is trained to predict the response variable, which is the presence/absence of seagrass meadows, based on the multispectral images retrieved in 2010. The classification is obtained by a majority vote of the decision trees in the Random Forest algorithm.
