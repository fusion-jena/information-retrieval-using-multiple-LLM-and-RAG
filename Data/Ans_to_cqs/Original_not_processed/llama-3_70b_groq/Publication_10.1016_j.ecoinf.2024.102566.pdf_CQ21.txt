Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to forest biomass estimation using machine learning methods and remote sensing imagery, but it does not provide information about the specific steps involved in model training or postprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
