Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses methods such as k-NN, k-means, random CF, Loop A, and Loop T, as well as lasso and bias correction. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The query mentions techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned in the context.
