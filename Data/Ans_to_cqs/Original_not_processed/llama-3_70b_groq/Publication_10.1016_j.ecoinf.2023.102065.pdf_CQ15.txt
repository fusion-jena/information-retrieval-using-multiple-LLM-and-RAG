Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to bioacoustic classification and soundscape analysis. It discusses various architectures, such as MobileNetv2 and ResNet, and techniques like mel-spectrograms, but does not provide information on optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
