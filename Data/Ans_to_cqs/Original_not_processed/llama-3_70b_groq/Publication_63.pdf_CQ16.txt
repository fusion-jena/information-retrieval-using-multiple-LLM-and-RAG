Answer::: 

The criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the validation MAE (Mean Absolute Error) does not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverges from the training MAE, which is referred to as 'overfit'. This means that the model is no longer improving its performance on the validation dataset and is starting to overfit the training data. At this point, the training process is stopped, and the trained model is applied to the test dataset for evaluation.
