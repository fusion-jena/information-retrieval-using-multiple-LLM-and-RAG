Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance on different datasets and its evaluation metrics, such as F1 scores. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

Typically, training completion criteria may include validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or reaching a certain number of epochs. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
