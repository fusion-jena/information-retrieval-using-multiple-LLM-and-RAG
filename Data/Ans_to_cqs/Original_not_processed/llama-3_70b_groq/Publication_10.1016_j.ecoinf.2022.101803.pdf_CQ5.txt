Answer: The datasets used in the pipeline are not typical deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets mentioned in the context are:

1. Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2015)
2. Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2011)
3. Sparrow population dataset
4. Wolf dataset

These datasets seem to be related to ecological informatics and habitat variables, with features such as food, temperature, population size, distance to high human use, and others. They are not typical computer vision datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
