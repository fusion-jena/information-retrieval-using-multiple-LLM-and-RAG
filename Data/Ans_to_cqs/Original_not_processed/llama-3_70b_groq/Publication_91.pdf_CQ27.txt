Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for pollen species identification, including the dataset, data augmentation, and training parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.
