Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a project called SMARTLAGOON, which involves collecting water quality data from satellite remote sensing services, specifically from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The context discusses the development of a tool for collecting and organizing satellite data, but it does not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
