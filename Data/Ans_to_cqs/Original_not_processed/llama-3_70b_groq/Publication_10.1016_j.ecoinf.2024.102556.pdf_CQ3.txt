Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the feature-extraction network (MSNet) and its application in wildlife tracking. It discusses various layers and modules, such as Res2Net, group convolution, ELAN, MPConv, and RepConv, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention instance segmentation in the reference "Schindler, F., Steinhage, V., 2022. Instance segmentation and tracking of animals in wildlife videos: SWIFT-segmentation with filtering of tracklets. Eco. Inform. 71, 101794." This suggests that instance segmentation might be one of the annotation techniques used, but it is not explicitly stated.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
