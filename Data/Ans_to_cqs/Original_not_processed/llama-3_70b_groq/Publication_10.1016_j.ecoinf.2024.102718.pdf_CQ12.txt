Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer architecture, specifically the BEiT (Base Encoder and Iterator Transformer) model. This is mentioned in the context as "we employed our BEiT model to leverage transformer capabilities with these existing models." Additionally, the context also mentions the use of other models such as ViT (Vision Transformer) and Xception, which is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. However, the primary model used in the pipeline is the BEiT model, which is a Transformer-based architecture.
