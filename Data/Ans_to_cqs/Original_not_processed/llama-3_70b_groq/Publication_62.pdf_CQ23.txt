Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, as well as the supplementary materials and author contributions. There is no mention of diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other techniques used to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
