Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on active learning, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks. It discusses the use of neural networks for dimensionality reduction, active learning strategies, and the selection of informative samples for labelling. However, it does not mention regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
