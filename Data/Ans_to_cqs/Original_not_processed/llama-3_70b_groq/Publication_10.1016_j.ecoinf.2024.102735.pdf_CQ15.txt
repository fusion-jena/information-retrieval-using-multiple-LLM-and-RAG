Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the use of Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, to tune the hyperparameters of a model, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
