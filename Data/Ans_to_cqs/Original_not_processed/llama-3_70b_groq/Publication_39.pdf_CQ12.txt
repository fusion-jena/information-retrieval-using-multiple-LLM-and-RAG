Answer:::
Answer: The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and SPyNet (a type of optical flow network). Specifically, the Mask R-CNN model, which is a type of CNN, is used for object detection. The ResNet variants, which are also CNNs, are used as backbones for the FGFA model. Additionally, the SPyNet model is used to implement the flow network in the FGFA architecture. There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer models in the provided context.
