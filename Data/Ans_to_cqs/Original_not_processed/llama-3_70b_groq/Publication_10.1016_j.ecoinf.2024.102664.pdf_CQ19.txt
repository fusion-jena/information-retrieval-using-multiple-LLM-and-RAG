Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the CNN and LSTM models, and discusses their performance and applicability in time series signal processing. It does not provide information about the framework or library used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) was used to build the deep learning model.
