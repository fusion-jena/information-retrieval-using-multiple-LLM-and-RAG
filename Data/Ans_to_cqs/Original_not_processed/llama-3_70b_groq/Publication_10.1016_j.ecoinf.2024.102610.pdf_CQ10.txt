Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers, R packages, and their documentation. There is no mention of a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
