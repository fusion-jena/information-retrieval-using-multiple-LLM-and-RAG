Answer:::

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the full data set can be split in various ways, and that the naive approach of randomly sampling images from the full data set may not be suitable due to the images being captured in close proximity and potentially having overlapping fields of views, which could lead to information leakage between the data sets.

It is mentioned that the training set was balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species". This suggests that the authors took steps to ensure that the training set is representative of the class distribution, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

However, it is not clear if any other measures were taken to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the model's generalizability was ensured through these specific measures.
