Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Aerial surveys: As mentioned in the context, aerial surveys provide a cost-effective way to collect environmental information over large areas in a short amount of time. These surveys are likely used to collect data on ISMMMOs (Invasive Species of Marine Macroalgae and Marine Megafauna Objects).

2. Airborne camera systems: The context mentions that images are streamed from airborne camera systems to monitor ISMMMOs. This suggests that camera systems mounted on aircraft are used to collect image data on ISMMMOs.

3. Optical and SAS (Synthetic Aperture Sonar) data: The reference to Abu et al. (2022) suggests that optical and SAS data are used to collect information on underwater man-made objects.

4. 3D posture data: The reference to Çalıs¸kan (2023) implies that 3D posture data is collected to detect human activity types using deep learning models.

5. Bird surveys: The reference to Bibby et al. (1998) suggests that bird surveys are conducted to collect data on bird communities.

It is worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention the use of public datasets or sensors for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that these methods are used in conjunction with the mentioned methods to collect data for the deep learning pipeline.
