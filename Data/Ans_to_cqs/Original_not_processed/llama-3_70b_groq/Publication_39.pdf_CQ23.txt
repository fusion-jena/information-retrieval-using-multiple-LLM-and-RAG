Answer:::

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the annotated dataset "AnnotationsActions" is split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set, with the test set including 20% of the video clips of each class, and the validation set including 20% of the remaining clips in each class. This suggests that some form of data splitting is used, but it is not clear if this is done in a stratified manner.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models are pretrained on large datasets such as COCO 2017 and Kinetics-400, which could provide some level of generalizability. However, it is not clear if any other measures are taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
