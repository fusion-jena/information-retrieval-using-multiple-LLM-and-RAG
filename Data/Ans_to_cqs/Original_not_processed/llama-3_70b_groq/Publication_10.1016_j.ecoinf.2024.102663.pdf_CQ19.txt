Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. It only mentions the use of deep learning techniques, architectures, and models like Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and YOLO, but it does not specify the framework used to build these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
