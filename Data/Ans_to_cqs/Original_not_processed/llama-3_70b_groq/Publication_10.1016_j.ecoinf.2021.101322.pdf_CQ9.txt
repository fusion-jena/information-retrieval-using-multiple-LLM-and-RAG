Answer::: 

The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, there are some hints that might be helpful. 

In the "Data availability" section, two DOIs (digital object identifiers) are provided, which are doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887 and doi:10.21. These DOIs might point to the data repositories, but the specific repository names (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) are not mentioned. 

Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data repository. If you have access to the DOIs, you can try resolving them to find the corresponding repository.
