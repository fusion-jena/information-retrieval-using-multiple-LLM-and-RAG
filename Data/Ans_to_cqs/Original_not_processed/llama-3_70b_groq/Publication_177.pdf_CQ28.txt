Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the performance metrics of various deep learning models on two datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200, and mentions the use of Bayesian optimization to find optimal hyperparameters. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
