Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The only hyperparameter mentioned is γ, which is set to 10% for all experiments of IFTL. However, it is not clear what γ represents or how it is used in the model. There is no mention of other hyperparameters, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
