Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the REVIS system, its framework, and its application to highway air quality monitoring and prediction, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. The context mentions various technical aspects of the system, such as hardware specifications, deep learning models, and scalability testing, but it does not mention specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
