Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the active learning pipeline, embedding models, and detector models, but it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves object detection, as it mentions running a pre-trained detector model on images and embedding the obtained crops into a lower-dimensional space. This suggests that the dataset might involve bounding box annotations, but this is not explicitly stated.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific annotation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
