Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions Darknet, which is an open-source neural network framework, but it is not typically considered a deep learning framework in the same vein as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Darknet is often used for object detection tasks, and YOLOv4, which is mentioned in the context, is a specific object detection algorithm that can be implemented in Darknet. However, it does not provide information about the underlying framework used to build the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
