Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the evaluation metrics, model architecture, and training process, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
