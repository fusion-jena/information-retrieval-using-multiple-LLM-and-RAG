Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include random rotations and flips. These techniques are mentioned in the context as "image augmentation operations" that were applied to the input images during the network training process to enhance the network's robustness. However, it does not mention scaling as one of the data augmentation techniques used.
