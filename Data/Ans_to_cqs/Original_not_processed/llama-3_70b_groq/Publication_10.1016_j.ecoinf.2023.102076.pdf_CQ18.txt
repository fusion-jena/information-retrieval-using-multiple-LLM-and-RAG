Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the experiments and results of training BERT models with different selection strategies for training data, but it does not mention how the model performance was monitored during training. It only shows the performance of the models in terms of median F1 score after training with different amounts of data (Fig. 4) and with different selection strategies (Fig. 5).
