Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a study on honey bees and their suitability in different landscapes, using a fuzzy logic-based model called Apis-FIS. The text discusses the model's rules, validation, and comparison with field data, but it does not mention deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
