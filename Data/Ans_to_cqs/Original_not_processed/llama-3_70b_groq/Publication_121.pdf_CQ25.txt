Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the top classifier softmax layer was added for predicting the class for an input image. Additionally, the model is used for tree species identification, which implies that the model is designed to classify images of leaves into different tree species. There is no mention of segmentation or detection tasks in the provided context.
