Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of LaDeco, its functionality, and the underlying technologies used. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, such as Deeplabv3+Resnet269, and the availability of other models through GluonCV. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used for training, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

The context does mention the ADE20K dataset, which is a well-known dataset for scene recognition and semantic segmentation. It is likely that this dataset was used for training, but the context does not provide explicit information on how the dataset was used to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
