Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods for bird species recognition and classification. However, it does mention the use of the Xeno-Canto website as a source of bird species data. 

It can be inferred that the raw data might be collected from public datasets, such as Xeno-Canto, or other online repositories of bird species audio recordings. Additionally, sensors or audio recorders might be used to collect raw audio data in the field. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In general, the methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can vary widely depending on the specific application and domain. Surveys, sensors, public datasets, and other sources can be used to collect raw data, but the specific methods used in this context are not mentioned.
