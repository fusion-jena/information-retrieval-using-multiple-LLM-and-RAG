Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for SOCS modeling, but it does not provide information on how the model was validated or what techniques were used to ensure its generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
