Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land-use types, soil properties, and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The mention of "high-resolution remotely sensed imagery" in the context of Huang et al. (2019) suggests that image data may be involved, but it does not specify the format of the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
