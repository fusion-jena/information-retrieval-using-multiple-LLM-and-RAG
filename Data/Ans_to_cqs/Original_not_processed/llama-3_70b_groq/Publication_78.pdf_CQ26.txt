Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on comparing the performance of different classifiers and deep learning models for coral reef classification, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing, and it does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
