Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of an autoencoder for ecoacoustic analysis, and the comparison of feature representations using Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder. It does not discuss data preprocessing techniques to address bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
