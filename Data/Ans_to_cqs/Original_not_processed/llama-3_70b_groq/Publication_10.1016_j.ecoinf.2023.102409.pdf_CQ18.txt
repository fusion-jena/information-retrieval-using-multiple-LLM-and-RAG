Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), Mean pixel accuracy (MPA), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. These metrics are used to test the model's performance, but it is not clear how they are used to monitor the model's performance during training. 

It is common to use these metrics to evaluate the model's performance on a validation set during training, and adjust the hyperparameters or learning rate accordingly. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training.
