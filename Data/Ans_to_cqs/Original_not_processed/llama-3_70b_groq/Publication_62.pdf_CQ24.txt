Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to digitized natural history collections, highlighting their potential in image classification and species identification. It does not delve into the technical details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the supplementary materials provided include Mathematica notebooks and annotated PDFs used to define and train the CNNs. These notebooks might contain information on how randomness was handled during the training process, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as fixing random seed values, using reproducible random number generators, and implementing regularization techniques to reduce overfitting. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact strategies employed in this particular study.
