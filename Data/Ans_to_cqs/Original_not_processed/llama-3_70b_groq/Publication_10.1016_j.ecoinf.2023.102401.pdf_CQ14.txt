Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance evaluation of different networks using various attention mechanism modules, provides a comparison of their performance, and explains the metrics used to evaluate the models. It also describes the datasets used and the data augmentation techniques employed. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
