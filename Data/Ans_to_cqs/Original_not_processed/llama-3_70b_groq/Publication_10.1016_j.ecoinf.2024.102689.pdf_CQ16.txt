Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on the evaluation methodology, performance metrics, and comparison with benchmark models, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

The context mentions the use of folded cross-validation, which involves training and testing the model on different folds of the dataset. However, it does not specify how the training process is terminated or what conditions are used to determine when the training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
