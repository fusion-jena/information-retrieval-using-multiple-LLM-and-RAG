Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various machine learning models, such as AutoML, TABPFN, and XGBoost, and their applications, but it does not provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
