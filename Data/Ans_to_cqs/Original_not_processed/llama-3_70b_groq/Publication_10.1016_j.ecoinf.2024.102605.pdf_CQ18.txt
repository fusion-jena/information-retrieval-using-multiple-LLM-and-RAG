Answer: I don't know.

The provided context consists of various research papers and articles related to agriculture, ecology, and remote sensing, but none of them explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The papers focus on topics such as plant disease detection, vegetation index estimation, and pest detection using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. While some papers may mention model evaluation metrics or performance assessment, they do not provide a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
