Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the challenges of integrating multiple datasets, accounting for biases, and evaluating model performance. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
