Answer: 

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, nor does it discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy logic model (Apis-FIS) used for evaluating the suitability of landscapes for bee habitats. The model is validated by comparing its output with field data from 12 sites, and the results show a good match between the model predictions and field estimations. However, there is no mention of deep learning models, diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
