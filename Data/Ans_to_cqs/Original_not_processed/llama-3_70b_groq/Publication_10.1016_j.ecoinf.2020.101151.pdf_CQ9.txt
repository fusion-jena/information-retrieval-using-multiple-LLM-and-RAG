The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be discussing fire weather indices, meteorological data, and a Web-GIS application, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or where its data repository might be located. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
