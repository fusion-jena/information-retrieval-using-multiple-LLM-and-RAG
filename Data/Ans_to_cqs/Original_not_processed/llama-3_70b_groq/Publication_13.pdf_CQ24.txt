Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity estimation, domain adaptation, and image segmentation. It discusses the challenges of intra-class variability, inconsistencies in photographs, and the importance of scaling the model with the size and complexity of the training data.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.
3. Implementing regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent the model from overfitting to random fluctuations in the data.

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are general practices in deep learning. If you need more specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, I would recommend consulting additional resources or literature.
