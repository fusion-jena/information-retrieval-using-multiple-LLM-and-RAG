Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy employed to handle randomness in the pipeline is the use of the `set.seed` function in R. This function is used to set the seed value for random number generation, which allows for reproducibility of the results. By setting the seed value, the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the code is run, ensuring that the results are consistent and reproducible.

This approach is used in the context of simulating populations of each species using a random normal sample through the `rnorm` function in R. By setting the seed value, the authors can ensure that the same simulated data is generated every time the code is run, which is important for evaluating the performance of the alternative approaches.

It's worth noting that this approach is specific to the R programming language and may not be directly applicable to deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, other strategies such as using fixed random seeds, shuffling data, and using techniques like dropout and batch normalization can be employed to handle randomness. However, based on the provided context, the use of the `set.seed` function is the strategy employed to handle randomness.
