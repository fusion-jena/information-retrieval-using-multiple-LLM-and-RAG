Answer::: 

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn 0.24. This is mentioned in the context for both the RBF kernel and the Random Forest (RF) model. For the RBF kernel, the best values for C and Î³ were optimized using GridSearchCV and were found to be 1000 and 1, respectively. Similarly, for the RF model, the number of trees and the maximum number of features to be considered for the best split were tuned via GridSearchCV and were found to be 130 and 'auto', respectively.
