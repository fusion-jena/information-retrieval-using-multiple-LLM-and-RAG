Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the 3-phase processing pipeline for training a network to extract plant cover information without training on actual annotated plant cover data. It explains the process of training a classification network, generating weak segmentation maps, and using these maps to train a segmentation network. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
