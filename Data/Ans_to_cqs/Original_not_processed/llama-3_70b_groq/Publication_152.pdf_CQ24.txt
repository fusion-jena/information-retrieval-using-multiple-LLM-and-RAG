Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of a U-Net model for identifying Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species, using images collected by a UAV. It discusses data augmentation, custom loss functions, and the use of different neural network architectures (e.g., SE-ResNet-50) to improve the model's performance.

However, in general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value: This ensures reproducibility of the results by setting the random seed to a fixed value.
2. Data shuffling: Shuffling the training data can help reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
3. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the input data for each mini-batch, which can help reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Ensemble methods: Combining the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations can improve the overall model's performance and robustness.
5. Hyperparameter tuning: Performing hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search can help find the optimal hyperparameters that are less sensitive to randomness.

These strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness.
