Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is detection, specifically underwater target detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions "underwater target detection models" in Step 1 and "YWnet network" that is deployed to recognize underwater organisms in Step 2. The model is designed to process underwater images and detect targets or organisms within them. The use of attention mechanisms, such as CBAM, and modules like SRC3 also suggest that the model is focused on detection tasks, as these components are often used to enhance feature extraction and improve detection performance.
