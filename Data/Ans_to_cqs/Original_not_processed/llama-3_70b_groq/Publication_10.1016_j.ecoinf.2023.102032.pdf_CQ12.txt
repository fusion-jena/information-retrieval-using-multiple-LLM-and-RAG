Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on wetlands and ecosystem health, using Sentinel-2 images and earth observation data. While it mentions machine learning and improving cloud detection, it does not provide details on the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of model is used in the pipeline.
