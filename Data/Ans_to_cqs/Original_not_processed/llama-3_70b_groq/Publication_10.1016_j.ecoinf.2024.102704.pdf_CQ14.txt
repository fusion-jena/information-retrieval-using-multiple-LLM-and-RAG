Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the relationship between model size and accuracy, and presents results from training various models (LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) at different scales (n, s, m, and l). It also shows the effect of reducing the number of parameters on processing speed. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
