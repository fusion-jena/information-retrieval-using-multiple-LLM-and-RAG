Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search or random search. However, it does mention that fivefold cross-validation and early stopping were employed for efficient hyperparameter optimization. This suggests that the hyperparameters were optimized using a combination of cross-validation and early stopping, but the specific method of optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
