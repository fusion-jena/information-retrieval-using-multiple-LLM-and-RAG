Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite images. This is evident from the mentions of "remotely sensed images", "satellite image classification", and "remote sensing images" throughout the text. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to satellite image classification and analysis.
