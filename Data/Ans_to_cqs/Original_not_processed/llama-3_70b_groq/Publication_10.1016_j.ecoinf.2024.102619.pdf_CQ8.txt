Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that "links to public code examples of accessible platforms/frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow" are available, but it does not specify where the code repository of the specific pipeline used in this study is located. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
