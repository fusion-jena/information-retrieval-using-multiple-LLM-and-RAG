Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the 2-BiLSTM network, the data used for training and validation, and the application of the model for land use classification. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps performed after training the model.

However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, it is likely that some postprocessing steps were involved, such as calculating metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), generating a confusion matrix, and possibly creating saliency maps to interpret the model's predictions. But these are just educated guesses, and without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact postprocessing steps taken.
