Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the best model was determined by comparing the MSE and R values for different numbers of neurons in the ANN system. It does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
