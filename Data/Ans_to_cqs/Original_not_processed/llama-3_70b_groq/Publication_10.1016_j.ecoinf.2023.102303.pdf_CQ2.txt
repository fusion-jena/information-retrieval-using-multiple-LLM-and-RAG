Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. This is evident from the description of the encoder in the self-supervised contrastive learning phase, which takes a batch of input images and augments them with random horizontal flipping, random ±7o rotation, and random ±40% brightness. Additionally, the context mentions "lazy image labeling" and "image processing outcomes" in Fig. 1, further supporting the use of image data format. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
