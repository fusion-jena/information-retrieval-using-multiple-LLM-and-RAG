Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of "convolution" and "max pool" in the table, which are common components of CNN architectures. Additionally, the references to papers such as "Going deeper with convolutions" [31] and "Delving deep into rectifiers" [33] suggest that the model is a CNN. Furthermore, the mention of "inception" modules in the table is also indicative of a CNN architecture, as the Inception module is a well-known component of CNNs.
