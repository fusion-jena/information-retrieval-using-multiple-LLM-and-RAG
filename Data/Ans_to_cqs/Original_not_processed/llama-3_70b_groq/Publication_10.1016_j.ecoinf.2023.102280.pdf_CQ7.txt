Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the challenges of generating training data for fine-tuning in bioacoustics applications, the application of deep learning-based denoising methods, and the importance of data requirements for many monitoring applications. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a subset of 100 training examples in Section 4.1.2, which suggests that the data splitting criteria might be related to the size of the dataset or the number of examples. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of data augmentation techniques, such as superimposing noise samples, which could be used to increase the size of the training dataset. 

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this question.
