Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on deep learning-based denoising methods for audio signals, particularly in bioacoustics applications. It discusses the use of U-net architectures, transformer attention mechanisms, and raw waveform data, but does not provide information about specific datasets used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
