Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically bumble bee species classification. This is mentioned in the text as "Many classification models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed in the field of computer vision. We compared the performance of four widely used models that vary in complexity of architecture to evaluate tradeoffs in accuracy and speed for bumble bee species classification."
