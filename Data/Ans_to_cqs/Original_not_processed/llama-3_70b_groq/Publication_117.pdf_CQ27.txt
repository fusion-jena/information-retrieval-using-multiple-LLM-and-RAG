Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for automated object detection, the importance of large training datasets, and the role of citizen scientists in creating these datasets. It also mentions the availability of source code and raw count data, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
