Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a variant of Mask R-CNN, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "D-Mask R-CNN architecture" in the text, which suggests that the model is an extension or modification of the original Mask R-CNN model. Mask R-CNN is a CNN-based architecture that is commonly used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks.
