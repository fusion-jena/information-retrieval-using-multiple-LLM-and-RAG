Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet, and their performance in image classification tasks. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement these architectures.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It could be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework, but it is not specified in the given text.
