Answer:::

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses Random Forest Regression (RFR) and CART models, which are ensemble learning and decision tree techniques, respectively. These models are used for regression tasks, particularly in nearshore bathymetry studies.

The context explains how RFR models construct multiple decision trees by randomly sampling data and features, and how the final regression result is obtained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. It also mentions that the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of overfitting.

However, there is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
