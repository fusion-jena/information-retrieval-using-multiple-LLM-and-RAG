Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting disease incidence in cotton, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but the exact ratio may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

In the context, it is mentioned that "training = 0.80 and R2" in the section discussing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network, which suggests that 80% of the data might have been used for training. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the context does not provide further information on data splitting criteria.
