Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of the AODEGRU model, including the hidden state update, attention scores, and loss calculation. It does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used during training.

However, it is mentioned that the model is initialized with given parameters (step 1 in the training process), and the loss function and optimizer are defined (step 2). This implies that the hyperparameters are assumed to be known or set before the training process begins. Unfortunately, the exact values or settings of these hyperparameters are not provided in the given context.
