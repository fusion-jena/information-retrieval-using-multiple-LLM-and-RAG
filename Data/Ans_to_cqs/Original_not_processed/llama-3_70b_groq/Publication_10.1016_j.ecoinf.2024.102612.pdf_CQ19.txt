Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a "DL model" and "SoftGroup model" without specifying the framework. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
