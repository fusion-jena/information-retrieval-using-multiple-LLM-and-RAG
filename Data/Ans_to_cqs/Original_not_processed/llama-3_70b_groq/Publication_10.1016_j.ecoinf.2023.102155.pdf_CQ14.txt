Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does mention the `ppmlasso` package and the `ppmlassoMixEngine` function, which suggests that the model is a type of generalized linear mixed model with a lasso penalty. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter Î», are optimized.

It is possible that the hyperparameters are optimized through a grid search or random search, but this is not specified in the provided context. The context does mention the `n.fits` argument, which is the number of models to fit through the regularization path, but it does not provide further information on how the hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
