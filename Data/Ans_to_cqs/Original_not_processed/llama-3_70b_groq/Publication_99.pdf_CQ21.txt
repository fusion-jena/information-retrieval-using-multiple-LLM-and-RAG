Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process, model architecture, and performance evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models is evaluated using metrics, and the results are discussed in the "Results and discussion" section. Specifically, it is mentioned that the models are evaluated using the SSIM score, and the average SSIM scores are reported for different models and damage ratios.

Therefore, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, but the context does not provide information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.
