Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data annotation process, model training, and the hyperparameters used for training the Mask R-CNN model. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
