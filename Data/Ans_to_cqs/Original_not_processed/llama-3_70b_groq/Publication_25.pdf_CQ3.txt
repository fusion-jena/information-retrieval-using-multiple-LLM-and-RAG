Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions "hand-annotated trees" and "high-quality annotations" without providing details on the annotation methods used. Therefore, I don't know the specific annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
