Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a field study on ecology and wildlife surveys, and it does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context includes information about survey types, habitats, seasons, and field plans, as well as references to academic papers and software tools. There is no indication of machine learning or model training being involved in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it seems out of scope for the given context.
