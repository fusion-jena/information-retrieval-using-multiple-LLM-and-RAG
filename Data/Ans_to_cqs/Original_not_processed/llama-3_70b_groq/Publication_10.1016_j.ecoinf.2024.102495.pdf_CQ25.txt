Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. This can be inferred from the text, which mentions that the classification process occurs from the data processed in the feature extraction section of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the text mentions the use of a SoftMax activation function layer, which is commonly used in classification problems. There is no indication of segmentation or detection tasks in the provided context.
