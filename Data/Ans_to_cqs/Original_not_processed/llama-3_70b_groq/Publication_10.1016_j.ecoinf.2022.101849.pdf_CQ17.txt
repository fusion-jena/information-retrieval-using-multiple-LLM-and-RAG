Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various approaches to handling incomplete labels, including random reduction, non-random reduction, and partial imputation algorithms. However, it does not mention regularization methods commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
