Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only describes the architecture of the CNN model, the number of samples used for training and testing, and the results of the model in terms of a confusion matrix. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
