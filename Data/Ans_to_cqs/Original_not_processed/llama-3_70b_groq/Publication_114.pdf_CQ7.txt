Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the classification of tree species using deep learning algorithms, specifically VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet, and presents the results of the classification. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
