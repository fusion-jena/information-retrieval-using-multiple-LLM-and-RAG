Answer: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used transfer learning from the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which is a large-scale object detection dataset. This suggests that the authors leveraged the pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset as a starting point for their model, and fine-tuned it on their own dataset of soil bacterial images. The exact dataset used for training and validation is mentioned as 65 images for training and 16 images for validation, but the name of the dataset is not provided.
