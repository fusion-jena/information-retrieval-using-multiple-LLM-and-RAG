Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the mitigation of device biases in ecoacoustic indices (EAI) and the expansion of their applicability to emerging fields like machine learning and deep learning. It discusses the effectiveness of a comprehensive processing pipeline in reducing device biases, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
