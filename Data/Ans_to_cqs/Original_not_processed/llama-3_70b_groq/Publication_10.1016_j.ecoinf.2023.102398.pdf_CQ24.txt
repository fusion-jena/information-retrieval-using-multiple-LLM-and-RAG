Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the attention mechanism, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. It does not discuss randomness or strategies to handle it.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of optimized hyperparameters, which might imply that some form of regularization or control over randomness is in place. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a uniform training environment, which could suggest that some efforts have been made to minimize the impact of randomness. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific strategies employed to handle randomness.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as fixing random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, or implementing techniques like dropout and batch normalization to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
