Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly mentioned what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some information from the given references.

In the context of air quality prediction, it is likely that the data formats used are related to environmental monitoring data, such as sensor readings, satellite images, or other types of numerical data. For example, the reference to Sentinel-5P datasets and Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) data products suggests that satellite imagery or remote sensing data might be used.

Additionally, the mention of "auxiliary datasets" in the context of integrating RS Data implies that other types of data, possibly in CSV or other tabular formats, might be used in conjunction with the satellite data.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
