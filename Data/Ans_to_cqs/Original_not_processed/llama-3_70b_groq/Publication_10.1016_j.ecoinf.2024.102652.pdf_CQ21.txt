Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function. It also discusses the model's architecture and its advantages. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
