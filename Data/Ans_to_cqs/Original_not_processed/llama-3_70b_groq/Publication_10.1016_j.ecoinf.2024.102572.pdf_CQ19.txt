Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments, but it does not specify the frameworks used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
