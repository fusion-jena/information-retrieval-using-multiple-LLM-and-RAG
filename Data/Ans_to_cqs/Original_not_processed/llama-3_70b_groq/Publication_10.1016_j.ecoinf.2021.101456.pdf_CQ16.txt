Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does provide some insights into the dynamic adjustment of the β value during training. 

The dynamic β-VAE formulation adapts the β value based on the changes in reconstruction and regularization losses. The β value is adjusted when either of these losses increases above a specific level of their historical minimum. This process continues until a new optimum is attained. 

Although this does not directly answer the question, it suggests that the training process might continue until the losses stabilize or reach a plateau. However, it is not explicitly stated as a criteria for determining the completion of training.

In the absence of explicit information, it can be inferred that the training process might be considered complete when the β value stabilizes, indicating that a balance between reconstruction and regularization losses has been achieved. However, this is only an inference and not a definitive answer.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the question, and it is unclear what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
