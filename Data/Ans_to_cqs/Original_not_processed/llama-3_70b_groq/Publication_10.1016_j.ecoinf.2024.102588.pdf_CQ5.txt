Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily discusses the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in aquatic ecosystem health estimation, and it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
