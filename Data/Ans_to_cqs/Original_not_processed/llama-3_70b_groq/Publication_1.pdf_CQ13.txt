Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context provides a general overview of deep learning, its applications, and how it can be used for biodiversity monitoring, but it does not delve into the specific details of the model's architecture or hyperparameters. The only mention of an optimization algorithm is stochastic gradient descent, but it is not specified as the optimizer used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
