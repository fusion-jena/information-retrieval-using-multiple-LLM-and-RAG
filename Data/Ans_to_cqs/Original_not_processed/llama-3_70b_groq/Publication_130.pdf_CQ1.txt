Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors are utilizing RFID tags and cameras to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they mention fitting RFID readers to a nest to automate the collection of data on which birds are providing care to the chicks and how often. Additionally, they mention using cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi to collect a large number of labeled pictures of birds. This setup is used to collect data on bird individuals, including their behavior and activities such as feeding and nest maintenance.

It does not appear that surveys or public datasets are being used to collect raw data in this particular study. Instead, the authors are relying on automated data collection methods using RFID tags and cameras to gather data on bird behavior and individuals.
