Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, MLP, and XGboost) for estimating rice canopy coverage and chlorophyll content. It discusses the accuracy evaluation of these models using metrics like R2, RMSE, and REP (%), but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
