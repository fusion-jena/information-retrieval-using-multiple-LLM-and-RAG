Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on deep noise reduction methods, their applications, and challenges in bioacoustics. It discusses the use of U-net architecture, transformer attention mechanisms, and raw waveform data, but does not provide information on regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
