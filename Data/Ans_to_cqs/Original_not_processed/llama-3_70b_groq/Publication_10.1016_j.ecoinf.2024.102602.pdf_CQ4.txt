Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include four transformations per image, which were selected considering the visual characteristics of plant species, as well as the typical properties of citizen-science and social media images. Specifically, horizontal flipping was adopted instead of vertical flipping. However, the exact techniques used, such as rotating, scaling, or cropping, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
