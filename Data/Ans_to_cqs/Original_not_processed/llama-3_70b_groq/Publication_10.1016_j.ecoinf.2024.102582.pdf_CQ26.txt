Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and landscape analysis, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

The context mentions random sampling of points in Google Earth Pro, dividing the samples into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio, and using a random forest algorithm for classification. However, it does not discuss techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
