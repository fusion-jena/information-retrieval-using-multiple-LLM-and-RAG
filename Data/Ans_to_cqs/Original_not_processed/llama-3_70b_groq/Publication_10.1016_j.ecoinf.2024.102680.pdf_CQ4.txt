Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that the input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations, including "mosaic data augmentation". This suggests that mosaic data augmentation is one of the techniques used in the pipeline. Unfortunately, the context does not provide further information on other data augmentation techniques that might be used.
