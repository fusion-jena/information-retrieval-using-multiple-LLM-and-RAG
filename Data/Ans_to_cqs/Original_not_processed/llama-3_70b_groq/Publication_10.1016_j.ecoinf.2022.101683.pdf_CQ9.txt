Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It appears to be a snippet from a research paper discussing ecological informatics and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or its associated data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
