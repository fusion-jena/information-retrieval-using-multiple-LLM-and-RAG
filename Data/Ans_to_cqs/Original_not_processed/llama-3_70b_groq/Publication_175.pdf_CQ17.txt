Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on few-shot learning, data augmentation, and optimization-based methods for adapting to new tasks with limited examples.

However, it does mention the risk of overfitting when using augmented data in few-shot learning, especially with very few training samples and few conditions. This implies that overfitting is a concern in these scenarios, but it does not provide specific regularization methods to address it.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
