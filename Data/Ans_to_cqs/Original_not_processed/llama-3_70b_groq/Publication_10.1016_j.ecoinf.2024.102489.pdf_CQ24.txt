Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses Random Forest (RF) models, which are a type of machine learning algorithm, not deep learning. 

However, it does mention that the randomness in RF is due to the random selection of samples and characteristic variables. To handle this randomness, the context suggests using techniques such as grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the model.

It does not provide information on strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
