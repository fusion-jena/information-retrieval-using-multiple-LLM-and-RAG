Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models, including ensemble models, and their accuracy and F1-scores on the PlantVillage dataset. It also mentions the convergence of the EfficientNetB3 model at the fourth epoch, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
