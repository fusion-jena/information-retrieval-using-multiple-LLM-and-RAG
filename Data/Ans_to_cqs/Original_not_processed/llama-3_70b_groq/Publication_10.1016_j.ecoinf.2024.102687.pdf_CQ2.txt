Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a multi-channel image, specifically a 3-channel "sound image" derived from the spectrogram of audio recordings. The original spectrogram in decibels (dB) was decomposed into harmonic, percussive, and delta (HPD) features, which were then used as input to the CNN. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
