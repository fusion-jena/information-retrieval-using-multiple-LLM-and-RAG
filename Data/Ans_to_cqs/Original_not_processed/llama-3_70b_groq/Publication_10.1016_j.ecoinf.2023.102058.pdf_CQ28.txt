Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The references cited are research papers and articles, and they do not mention the deployment platform either. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
