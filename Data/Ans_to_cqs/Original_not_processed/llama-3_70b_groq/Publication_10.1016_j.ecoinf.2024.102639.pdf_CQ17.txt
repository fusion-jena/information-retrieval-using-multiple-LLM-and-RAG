Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and other machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. 

However, it does mention the use of a regularization parameter (‘C’) in the SVM model, which is calibrated through a grid search and cross-validation to balance model complexity and generalization prowess. This suggests that the regularization parameter is used to prevent overfitting in the SVM model.

There is no mention of dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used regularization methods in deep learning pipelines. The context also does not provide information about the use of deep learning models or neural networks, except for a brief mention of their capabilities in pattern recognition.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.
