Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on species distribution modeling and assemblage prediction. There is no explicit mention of the specific data formats used in the pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the input data may include remote sensing data, citizen science observations, and environmental predictors, which could be in formats such as CSV, GeoTIFF, or other spatial data formats.

The mention of computer vision models and the reference to "remote sensing characterization of environmental heterogeneity" suggests that image data may be involved, but it is not explicitly stated. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the possible data formats used, the exact formats are not specified in the provided context.
