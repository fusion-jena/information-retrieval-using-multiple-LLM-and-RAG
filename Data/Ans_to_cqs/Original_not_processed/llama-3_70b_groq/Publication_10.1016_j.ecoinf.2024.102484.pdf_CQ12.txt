Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The paper by Huang et al. (2019) mentions the use of deep learning, but it does not specify the type of model used. The other papers and context provided do not provide this information either. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
