Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of LSTM and VR + SVR models on a specific task, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, and presenting the results of experiments. It does not provide information on the dataset preparation, model training, or evaluation protocols that could ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
