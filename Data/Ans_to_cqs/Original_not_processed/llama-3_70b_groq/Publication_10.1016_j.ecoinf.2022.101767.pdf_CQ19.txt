Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about building a deep learning model or using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be discussing the use of online shared videos to study species richness and the benefits of ecosystems, citing references from 2015 and 2018. There is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
