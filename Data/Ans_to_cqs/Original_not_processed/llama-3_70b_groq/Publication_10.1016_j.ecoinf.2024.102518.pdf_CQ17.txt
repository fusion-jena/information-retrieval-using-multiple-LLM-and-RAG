Answer: The provided context does not mention deep learning or any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling using MaxEnt and other algorithms, and the regularization method mentioned is related to the tuning of the MaxEnt model, specifically the regularization multiplier. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
