Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text appears to be discussing a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, using vessel tracking data, environmental data, and biodiversity data. It mentions data classification, spatio-temporal aggregation, and statistical analysis, but does not provide information on the specific query. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
