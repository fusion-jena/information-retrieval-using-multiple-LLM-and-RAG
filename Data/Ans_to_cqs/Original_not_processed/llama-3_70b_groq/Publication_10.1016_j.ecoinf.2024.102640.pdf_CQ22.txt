Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (SegFormer) are:

1. IOU (Intersection over Union): This metric measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask.
2. PA (Pixel Accuracy): This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels.
3. mIOU (mean Intersection over Union): This metric is the average IOU across all classes.
4. F1-score: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is mentioned that SegFormer outperforms other models in terms of F1-score, indicating that it is one of the evaluation metrics used.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the SegFormer model on the UGE-D dataset, and the results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
