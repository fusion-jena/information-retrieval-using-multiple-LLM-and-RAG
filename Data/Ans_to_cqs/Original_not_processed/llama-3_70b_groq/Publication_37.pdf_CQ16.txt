Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the highest classification accuracy on the validation set. The model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. A validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. This suggests that the training is complete when the model achieves the highest classification accuracy on the validation set, rather than relying on a specific criteria such as validation loss plateau.
