Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the training data set was divided into two parts, where 80% was used for training/validation, and the remaining 20% was kept as unseen data for testing. This suggests that the data was split into training, validation, and testing sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not provided.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and time-series splitting. The goal of splitting the data is to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on different datasets to prevent overfitting and to get a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.

In this specific context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data without additional information.
