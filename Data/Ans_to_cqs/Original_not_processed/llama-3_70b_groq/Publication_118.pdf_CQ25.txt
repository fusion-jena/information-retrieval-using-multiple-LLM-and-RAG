Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated for a specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the model is being used for automatic feature extraction or representation learning. 

The authors mention that they want to explore the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction, which suggests that the model is being used to learn a representation of the input data that can be used for further analysis or processing. The authors also mention that they want to develop a general representation for machine learning that does not rely on labeled data or domain-specific features, which further supports this inference.

Therefore, while the specific task or purpose of the model is not explicitly stated, it appears to be focused on feature extraction or representation learning rather than a specific task like classification, segmentation, or detection.
