Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training process, including the optimizer, learning rate, and number of epochs, as well as the programming language and interface used (R with Rstudio and Keras). It also mentions the hardware used for training and prediction (Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card). However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
