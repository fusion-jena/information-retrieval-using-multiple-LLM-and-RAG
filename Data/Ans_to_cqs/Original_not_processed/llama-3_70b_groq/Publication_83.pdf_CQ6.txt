Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the audio files have varying lengths, and two methods are proposed to deal with this issue: repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2s, or directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size.

Additionally, the context mentions that different types of spectrograms are used as inputs to the CNNs, such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. This suggests that some form of feature extraction or transformation is being applied to the audio data before feeding it into the deep learning model.

However, the context does not provide further details on any additional preprocessing steps that may be involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is unclear what specific preprocessing steps are being used in this particular case.
