Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation was employed to address the issue of overfitting. Data augmentation is a technique that expands a dataset by applying transformations, such as flipping, translation, and shear, to the existing data. This helps maintain dataset balance, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of deep learning models.

The context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what specific regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
