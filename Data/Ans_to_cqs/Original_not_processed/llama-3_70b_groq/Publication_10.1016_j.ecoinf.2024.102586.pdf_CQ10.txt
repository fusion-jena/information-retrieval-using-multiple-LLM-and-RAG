Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic references related to ecological informatics, biodiversity, and plant invasions. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link. The references are all academic papers and do not provide any information about a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
