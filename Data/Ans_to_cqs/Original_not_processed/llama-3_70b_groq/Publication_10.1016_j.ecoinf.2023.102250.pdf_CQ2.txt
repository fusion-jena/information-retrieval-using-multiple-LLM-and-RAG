Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically spectrograms. This is inferred from the mention of "generated images" and "spectrograms" in the text. There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats. The context suggests that the deep learning models, such as ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2, are being used for image classification tasks, and data augmentation techniques are being applied to enhance the dataset.
