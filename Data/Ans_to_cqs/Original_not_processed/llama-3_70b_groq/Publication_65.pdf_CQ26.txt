Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the text mentions that "we used rotation, noise, and flip (as in [50]) for data augmentation, and we were capable of augmenting the dataset by six times." This suggests that the authors employed data augmentation to increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially mitigate data bias. However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques were used in this specific pipeline.
