Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on different deep learning models such as Transformer-like models, MLP-like models, and CNN-like models, and their applications in computer vision tasks. It discusses the architecture and performance of these models, but does not provide information about data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
