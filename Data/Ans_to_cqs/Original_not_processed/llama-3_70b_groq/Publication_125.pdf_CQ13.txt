Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only provides information about the architecture of the proposed model, the architectures of other CNN models (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121), and their execution times. It does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used during training.
