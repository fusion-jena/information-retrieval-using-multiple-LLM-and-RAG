Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the VGG16 model, the hyperparameters used for training, and the techniques employed to prevent overfitting. It does not provide information about the specific framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
