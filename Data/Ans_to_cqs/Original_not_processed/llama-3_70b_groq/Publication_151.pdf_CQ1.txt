Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information about the data sets used in the experiments. 

For the simulated data sets, the branch lengths of the backbone species tree are estimated using sites randomly selected from the genes used in the experiments (32 genes for ILS data and 5 genes for HGT data) with each gene providing 500 sites. For the WoL data set, branch lengths of the species tree are available from the original study (estimated under GTR+Î“ from 100 randomly selected sites from 381 marker genes).

It can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected from genetic sequences or genomic data, but the exact methods of data collection (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets) are not specified.
