Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics for classification models, the structure of the generator in DR-ACGAN, and the comparison of IS and FID values for different ACGAN models. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete.

In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete based on the given information.
