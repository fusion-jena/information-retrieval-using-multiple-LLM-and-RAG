Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training of the model, including the hyperparameters used, data augmentation, and the architecture of the network. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
