Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated information extraction from soundscape recordings, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The references cited in the text are mostly academic papers and conferences, and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
