Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the deep learning models (CNNFULL and CNNFAST) for bat acoustic signal detection, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
