Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions that model performance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each of the three sample orderings, but it does not specify the exact metrics used for evaluation. Therefore, it can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used, but it is unclear if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are also used.
