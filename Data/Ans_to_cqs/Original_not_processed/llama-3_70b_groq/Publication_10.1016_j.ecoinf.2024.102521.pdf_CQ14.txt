Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the training and storage of models, the modular classification scheme, and the challenges of integrating insect classification and identification into the STARdbi infrastructure. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
