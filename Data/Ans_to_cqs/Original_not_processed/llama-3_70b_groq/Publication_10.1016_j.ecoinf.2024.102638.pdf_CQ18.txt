Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a 5-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate the model performance during the hyperparameter tuning process using GridSearchCV. The negative mean square error is set as the target measure for this evaluation. This suggests that the model performance is monitored during training using cross-validation, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring are not clearly stated.
