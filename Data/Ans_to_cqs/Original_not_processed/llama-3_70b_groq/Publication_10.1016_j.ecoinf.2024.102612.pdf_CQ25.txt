Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning (DL) model in this context is semantic segmentation, specifically for fuel model retrieval. The DL model is trained to classify different vegetal species in point clouds, which is a crucial step in fuel model retrieval. The model is used to segment point clouds into different classes, such as forest and non-forest features, and then retrieve the final fuel model classifications. The DL model's ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data makes it well-suited for this task, where there are many variables and relationships to consider, such as the horizontal and vertical continuities of different vegetal species.
