Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses Genetic Algorithms (GA) and their application in optimization problems. It also mentions other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as particle swarm optimization algorithms and firefly algorithms, but does not provide information on deep learning or handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
