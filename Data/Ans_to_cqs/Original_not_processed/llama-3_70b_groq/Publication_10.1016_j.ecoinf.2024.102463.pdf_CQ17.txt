Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on Hyperband, a hyperparameter tuning algorithm, and Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN), a type of recurrent neural network architecture. It discusses the architecture and training process of RHN, but does not mention regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
