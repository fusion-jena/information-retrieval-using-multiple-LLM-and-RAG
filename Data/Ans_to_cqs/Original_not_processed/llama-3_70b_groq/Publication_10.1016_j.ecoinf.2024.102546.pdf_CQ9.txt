Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses a survey of weed datasets, a systematic search of databases, and a deep learning pipeline for weed detection, but it does not provide information about where the pipeline's data repository is hosted. The references cited in the context are academic papers and GitHub repositories, but none of them seem to be related to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
