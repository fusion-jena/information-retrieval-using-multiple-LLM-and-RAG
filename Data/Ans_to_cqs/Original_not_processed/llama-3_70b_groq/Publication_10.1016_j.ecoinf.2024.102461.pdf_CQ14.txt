Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it discusses the methodology, validation, and results of the study. There is no mention of machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
