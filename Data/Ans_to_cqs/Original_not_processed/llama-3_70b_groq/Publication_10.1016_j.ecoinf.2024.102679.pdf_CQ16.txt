Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set was selected at each training stage. This suggests that the validation set performance is being monitored during training, and the model is selected based on its performance on this set. 

It can be inferred that the training might be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or reaches a plateau. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.
