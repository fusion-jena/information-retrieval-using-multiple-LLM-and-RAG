Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing satellite data and instruments, such as Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS, and their applications in monitoring systems. It also mentions data crawling tools and NetCDF files, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models or their generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
