Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a study on mangrove forests, including their evolution, conservation, and restoration, as well as the effects of governmental policies on these efforts. It also mentions landscape metrics and spatial analysis, but it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model.
