Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, parameter sensitivity, and placement of query sequences onto a reference tree using the trained model, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
