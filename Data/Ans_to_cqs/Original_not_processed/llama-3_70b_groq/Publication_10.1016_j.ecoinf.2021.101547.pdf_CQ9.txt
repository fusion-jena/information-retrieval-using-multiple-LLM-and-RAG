Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning for detecting polar bears, the ResNet-50 model, and the computational resources used, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the data is available.
