Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the Transformer model, its self-attention mechanism, and positional encoding scheme, which are all related to natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are typically applied to image data, but the context does not discuss image data or computer vision tasks.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
