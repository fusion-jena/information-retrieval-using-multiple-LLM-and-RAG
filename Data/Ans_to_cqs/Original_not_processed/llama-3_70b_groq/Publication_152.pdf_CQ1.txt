Answer: According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of a DJI Phantom 2 drone with a Global Positioning System (GPS). This drone is used to capture images of the Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species, from UAV flights at a constant height above ground. The images collected are then used to train the U-Net model for classification. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection in this specific context.
