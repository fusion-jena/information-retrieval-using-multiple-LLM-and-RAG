Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The study employed seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but not a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the study did conduct a correlation analysis of the variables before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that the researchers took some steps to ensure the robustness of their models, but the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not mentioned.
