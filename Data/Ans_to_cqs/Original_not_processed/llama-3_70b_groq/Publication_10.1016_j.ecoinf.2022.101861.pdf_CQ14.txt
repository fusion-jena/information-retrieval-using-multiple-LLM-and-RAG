Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text discusses the selection of a nightjar species with the least information available, using a combined index based on the number of scientific articles, observations, and recordings. It also describes the extraction of sounds using Kaleidoscope, but it does not provide information about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
