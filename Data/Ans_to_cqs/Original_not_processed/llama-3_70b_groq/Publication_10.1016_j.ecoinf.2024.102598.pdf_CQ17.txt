Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their applications in forest fire susceptibility mapping. It discusses the use of different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, and the optimization of their parameters, but it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of ensemble modeling as a means to provide robustness against overfitting. Ensemble modeling combines the predictions of multiple models to achieve more accurate and reliable results, which can help mitigate the risks of overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a 10-fold cross-validation design to validate the models, which is a common technique used to prevent overfitting.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, but it does discuss other techniques used to prevent overfitting, such as ensemble modeling and cross-validation.
