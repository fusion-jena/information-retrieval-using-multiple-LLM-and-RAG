Answer: The framework used to build the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. Additionally, a reference to Keras is provided in the references section, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Therefore, it can be inferred that Keras might be used as the framework to build the deep learning model, but it is not explicitly stated.
