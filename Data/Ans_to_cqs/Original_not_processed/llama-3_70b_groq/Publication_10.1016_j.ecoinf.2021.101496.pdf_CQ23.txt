Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

However, it is mentioned that the evaluation of the model was performed on a "test dataset" for all three modelling approaches, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that 100 successful runs of the ANN were performed, and the model residuals obtained in each run were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. This could be interpreted as a form of cross-validation or bootstrapping, but it is not explicitly stated.

Overall, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
