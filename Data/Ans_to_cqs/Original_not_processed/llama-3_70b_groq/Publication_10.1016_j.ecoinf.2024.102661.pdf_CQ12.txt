Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. This is explicitly mentioned in the context, particularly in Fig. 1, which shows the structure of the ACE forecasting model based on an LSTM neural network. Additionally, the context discusses the use of LSTM models and their intricate structures, highlighting the benefits of using the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM models.
