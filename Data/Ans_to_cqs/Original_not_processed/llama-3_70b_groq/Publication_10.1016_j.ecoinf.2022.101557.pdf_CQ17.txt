Answer: 

According to the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout with a rate of 0.3. This is mentioned in the section 2.2 Convolutional neural networks, where it is stated that "Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) with a rate of 0.3 is used during the training to make it more stable." There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization method being used.
