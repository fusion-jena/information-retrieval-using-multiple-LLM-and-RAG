Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context primarily focuses on various applications of machine learning and deep learning techniques in fields like ecology, hydrology, and signal processing. It discusses different models, such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, but does not delve into regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention techniques like feature selection, which can be used to prevent overfitting by reducing the dimensionality of the input data. Additionally, some of the referenced papers may implicitly use regularization methods, but these are not explicitly mentioned.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. However, these are not mentioned in the provided context.
