Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide any information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models, including MLPNN and XGBoost, for estimating carbon stocks in a reforested urban landscape in South Africa. It provides details about the methodology, data, and results, but does not include any information about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) where the code is available.
