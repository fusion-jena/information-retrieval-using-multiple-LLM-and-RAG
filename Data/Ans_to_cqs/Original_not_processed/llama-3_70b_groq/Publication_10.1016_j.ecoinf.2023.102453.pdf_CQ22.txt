Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are derived based on the relative numbers of True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Negative (FN), and False Positive (FP) images. 

Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances and total instances, but it may not be reliable with imbalanced classes. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances and the total positive instances. Recall indicates the number of positive instances that are classified correctly. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

In the case of multi-class classification, macro and weighted measures of these performance metrics are used to understand a model's performance. These measures are helpful in evaluating the model's performance in multi-class classification.
