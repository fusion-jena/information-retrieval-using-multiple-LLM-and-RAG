Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to coral reefs, marine biology, and statistical methods, but it does not provide information about deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
