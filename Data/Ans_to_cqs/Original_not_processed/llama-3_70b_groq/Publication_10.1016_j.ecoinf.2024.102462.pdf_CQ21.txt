Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the evaluation of the network on the real problem is performed by feeding it an independent data set not seen during training (the testing data set). 

Additionally, it is mentioned that the results of the training sets are presented as confusion matrices in Fig. 6 (bottom row). This suggests that one of the postprocessing steps involved is the calculation of the confusion matrix. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other metrics calculation as postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the context only provides information about the calculation of the confusion matrix as a postprocessing step, but not about saliency maps or other metrics calculation.
