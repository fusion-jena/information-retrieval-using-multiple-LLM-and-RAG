Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches, but it does not specify the type of model used. It references other studies that use specific models, such as LCSE-ResNet, but it does not indicate that this model is used in the pipeline being described. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
