Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, machine learning, and land use/land cover classification, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
