Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools for classification, but it does not provide specific details about the model architecture or hyperparameters. The focus of the text is on the application of machine learning methods to ecological informatics and historical ecology, rather than on the technical details of the models themselves. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
