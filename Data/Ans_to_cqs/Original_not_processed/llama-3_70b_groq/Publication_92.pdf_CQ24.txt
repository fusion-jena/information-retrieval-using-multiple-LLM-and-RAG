Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, the addition of new classes to the species database, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion steps. It does not discuss random seed values or strategies to handle randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of back-propagation and gradient-based descent in the training process, which are common techniques used in deep learning to optimize the model's parameters. These techniques can help the model converge to a stable solution despite the presence of randomness in the data or the initialization of the model's parameters.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as fixing the random seed value, using dropout layers, and applying regularization techniques to handle randomness and improve the model's robustness. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
