Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the network was trained until reaching a target minimal error. Additionally, it mentions that the optimal learning rate, momentum, and training iterations were determined through tests. 

It can be inferred that the training process was stopped when the error reached a minimum threshold or when the improvement in error reduction was negligible. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
