Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in agriculture, smart farming, and IoT, as well as the challenges and limitations of current frameworks. It discusses the need for cost-effective models, robust to noise and variability, and facilitating real-time decision-making.

However, it can be inferred that sensors might be used for collecting raw data, as IoT (Internet of Things) is mentioned in the context of smart farming. IoT devices, such as sensors, can collect data from the environment, which can then be used as input for deep learning models. Additionally, public datasets might be used, as the context mentions the need for large datasets, which could be sourced from public repositories.

Surveys are not explicitly mentioned as a method for collecting raw data, but they might be used in certain agricultural applications, such as collecting data on farmer practices or crop yields.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that sensors and public datasets might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific methods used for data collection are not explicitly stated.
