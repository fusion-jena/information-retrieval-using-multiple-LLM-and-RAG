Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the development of a system called BirdNET, which uses CNNs and spectrogram data to classify 984 bird species. It mentions that the input is a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. However, it does not mention any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
