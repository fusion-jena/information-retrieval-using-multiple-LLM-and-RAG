Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping method with a patience equal to 5. This method is used to avoid overfitting and to achieve optimal training. The model's performance is monitored, and the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation subset stops improving. In this case, the optimal training was achieved at the end of the ninth epoch, with a maximum loss of 3 for the training subset and 4.5Ã—10^(-4) for the validation subset.
