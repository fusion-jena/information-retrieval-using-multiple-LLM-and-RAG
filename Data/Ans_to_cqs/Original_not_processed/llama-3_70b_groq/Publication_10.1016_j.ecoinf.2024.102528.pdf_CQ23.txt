Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations and the results obtained from the analysis. It does not provide information on the model's development or training process, which is where these measures would typically be discussed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
