Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "spatial inputs" and "masks of states" with dimensions 257 × 257 × 9, it can be inferred that the data format might be related to image or spatial data. Additionally, the context discusses forest fires and cellular automata, which might suggest that the data format could be related to geospatial or raster data. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
