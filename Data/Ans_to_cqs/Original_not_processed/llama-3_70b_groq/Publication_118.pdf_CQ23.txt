Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only discusses the architecture of the autoencoder model, the evaluation metrics used, and the comparison of the results with other feature representations (Spectral Indices and MFCC). It also mentions that the experiment was run 20 times using a subset of the total dataset, but it does not provide further details on how the dataset was split or if any techniques were used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
