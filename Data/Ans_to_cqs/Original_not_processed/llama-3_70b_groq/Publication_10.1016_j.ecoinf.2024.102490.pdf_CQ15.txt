Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, climate change, and statistical computing, but it does not provide information about deep learning or optimization techniques. The mentioned algorithms, such as XGBOOST, GBM, RF, and MaxEnt, are machine learning algorithms, but they are not deep learning algorithms, and the context does not specify the optimization techniques used with these algorithms.
