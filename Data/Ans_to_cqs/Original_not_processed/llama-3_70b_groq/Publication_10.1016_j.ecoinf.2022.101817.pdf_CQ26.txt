Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the classification pipeline, model evaluation, and references to various research papers on image classification and deep learning. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine which techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
