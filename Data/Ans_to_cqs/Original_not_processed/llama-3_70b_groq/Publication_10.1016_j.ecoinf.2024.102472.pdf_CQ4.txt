Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters and training processes of gradient boosting and artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs). It discusses the tuning of hyperparameters, the architecture of MLPNNs, and the training process, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
