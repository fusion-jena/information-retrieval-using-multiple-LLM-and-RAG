Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses the datasets used in the study, which are ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). It is mentioned that ImageNet is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, and each image in the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected for these datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions that the SS and LSM datasets are camera trap image datasets, where each time the camera is triggered, it captures multiple images in succession, called a capture event. However, it does not provide information on how the cameras were set up or how the data was collected.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
