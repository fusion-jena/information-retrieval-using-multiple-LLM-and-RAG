Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the application of different normalization strategies to improve network accuracy, but it does not specify any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
