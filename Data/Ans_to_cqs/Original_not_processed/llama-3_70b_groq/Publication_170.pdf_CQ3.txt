Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of deep learning for image classification in wildlife surveys, particularly for automatically filtering empty camera images. It discusses the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, specifically the AlexNet model, and its performance on a dataset of camera-trap images. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used to prepare the training dataset. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
