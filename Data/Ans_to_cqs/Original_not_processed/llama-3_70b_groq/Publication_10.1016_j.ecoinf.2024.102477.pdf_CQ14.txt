Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the SVR model are optimized. It only mentions that the exponential parameters were set as follows: C = 20-210, ε = 2^(-8)-2^21, and σ is not specified. It also presents the training results for the hyperparameter-optimized SVR model in Table 2, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
