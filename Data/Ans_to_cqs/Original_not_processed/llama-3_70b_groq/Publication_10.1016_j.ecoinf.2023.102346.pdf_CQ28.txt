Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and microbiome-based classification problems, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
