Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the mini-batch size, its effects on the training process, and the limitations imposed by the available GPU memory. It also touches on the general challenges of using deep learning and the need for trial and error in setting training options. However, it does not provide specific information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
