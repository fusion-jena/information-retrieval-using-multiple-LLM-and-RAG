Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used is in the form of images, specifically hyperspectral images, as mentioned in the paper "Deep learning for hyperspectral image classification: An overview" by Li et al. (2019). 

Additionally, the context mentions fish tracking and counting using images, as seen in the paper "Fish tracking and counting using..." by Lumauag and Nava (2019). It can be assumed that the images used for training the model were collected through some form of camera or sensor system, but the exact method is not specified.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary method of data collection is through images, likely obtained through camera or sensor systems. However, more information is needed to provide a more detailed answer.
