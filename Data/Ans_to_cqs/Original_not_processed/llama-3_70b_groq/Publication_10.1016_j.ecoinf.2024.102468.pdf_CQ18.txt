Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the F1-score is used to evaluate the model performance. The F1-score is a metric that balances precision and recall, and a higher F1-score (close to 1) indicates better model performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the experiments are performed over different runs to help capture the variability introduced by random factors such as random initialization of weights in ANN or random sampling during training. This suggests that the model performance is monitored and evaluated across multiple runs to account for the randomness in the training process.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
