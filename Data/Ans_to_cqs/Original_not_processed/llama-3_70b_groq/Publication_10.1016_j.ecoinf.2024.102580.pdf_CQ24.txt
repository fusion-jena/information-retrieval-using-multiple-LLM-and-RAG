Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text focuses on the workflow of selecting a deep learning model, developing a ground-truth imagery dataset, training the models, evaluating their performance, and analyzing the data to quantify spatial patterns and resilience of the ecosystem. 

It does mention the use of a pre-trained RestNet-50 model, which may have its own built-in mechanisms for handling randomness. However, there is no explicit discussion of strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
