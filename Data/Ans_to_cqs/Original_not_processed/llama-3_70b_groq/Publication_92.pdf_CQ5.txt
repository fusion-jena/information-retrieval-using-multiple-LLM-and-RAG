Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the 2012 ImageNet competition, which suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used. Additionally, the context discusses a species database with classes such as "part of fish", "fish", and "random/speciÔ¨Åc background", which implies that a custom dataset is being used for fish detection and recognition in underwater videos. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets.
