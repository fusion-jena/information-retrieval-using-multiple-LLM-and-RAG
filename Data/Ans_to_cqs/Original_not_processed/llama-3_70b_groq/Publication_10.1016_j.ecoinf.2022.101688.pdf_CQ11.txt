Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the experiments and results of using pre-trained CNNs for bioacoustics research, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
