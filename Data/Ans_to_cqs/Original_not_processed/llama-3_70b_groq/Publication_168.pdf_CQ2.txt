Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the keywords and the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely hyperspectral image (HSI) data. This is because the context mentions "hyperspectral image classification" and "unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)" which suggests that the data is in the form of images captured by UAVs with hyperspectral sensors. The deep learning models mentioned, such as CNNs, are also commonly used for image classification tasks.
