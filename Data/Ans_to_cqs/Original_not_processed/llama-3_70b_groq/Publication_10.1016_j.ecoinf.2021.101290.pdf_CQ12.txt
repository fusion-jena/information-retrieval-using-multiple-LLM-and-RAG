Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence for automated annotation and analysis, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. It mentions the rapid development in machine learning and the desire to take advantage of it, but it does not provide details about the specific model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
