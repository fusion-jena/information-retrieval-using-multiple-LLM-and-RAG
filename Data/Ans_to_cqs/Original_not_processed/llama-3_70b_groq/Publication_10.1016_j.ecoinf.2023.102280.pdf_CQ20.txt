Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only mentions that deep learning-based denoising methods can be applied in "sub-real time on limited hardware" (Defossez et al., 2020), but it does not specify what type of hardware is being referred to. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
