Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, HMMs, and Na√Øve Bayes classification for predicting diving locations of birds, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
