Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process to eliminate bias. This suggests that the authors were aware of the potential for bias in their dataset and took steps to mitigate it.

Additionally, the context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It primarily focuses on the use of hybrid models, Bayesian optimizers, and Tree-based Distributed Optimization (TDO) for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
