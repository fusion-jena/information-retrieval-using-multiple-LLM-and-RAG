Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various topics such as word embeddings, word2vec, and natural language processing, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. It mentions the use of pre-trained models and existing word2vec spaces, but it does not describe the process of optimizing hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
