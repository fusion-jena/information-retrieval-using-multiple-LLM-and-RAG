Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to permafrost and ecological informatics, and it does not mention deep learning pipelines or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context includes figures and tables related to permafrost and vegetation height, as well as variables such as soil temperature, soil water content, and solar radiation. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision concepts, which are typically associated with data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
