Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the setup and training of various species distribution models (SDMs) and the SDP-EPL model, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
