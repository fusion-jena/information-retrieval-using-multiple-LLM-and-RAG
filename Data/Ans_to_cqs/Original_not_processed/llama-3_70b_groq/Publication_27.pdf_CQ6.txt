Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and codes, which do not provide any meaningful information related to the query.

However, I can provide a general answer to the query based on my knowledge. The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model typically include:

1. Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.
2. Data normalization: Scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
3. Data scaling: Transforming the data to a specific range, such as standardization or feature scaling, to improve model performance.
4. Feature selection: Selecting the most relevant features to include in the model, and removing irrelevant or redundant features.
5. Data augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping, to the existing data.
6. Handling imbalanced datasets: Addressing class imbalance issues by oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using class weights.

These preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.
