Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline utilizes underwater spectral images for collecting raw data. This is mentioned in the article "underwater spectral images enables dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats. Methods Ecol. Evol. 14 (2), 596â€“613." This suggests that the method used for collecting raw data is through underwater spectral imaging.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of coral reef monitoring nodes, which may imply that sensors are also used to collect data. However, it is not clear what type of data is being collected by these sensors.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that other methods may be used, but based on the provided context, underwater spectral imaging and sensors appear to be the primary methods used.
