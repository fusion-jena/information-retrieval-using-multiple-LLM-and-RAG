Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of neural networks and deep learning algorithms in ecological informatics, specifically in predicting ecological footprints. It discusses the use of various neural network models, such as radial basis function neural networks and backpropagation neural networks, but does not provide information on data collection methods.

The context does mention the use of data from 2014 and 2015 as a test dataset, but it does not specify how this data was collected. It is possible that the data was obtained from public datasets, surveys, or sensors, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
