Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ensemble learning methods, specifically bagging and boosting, and their application to ecological datasets. The datasets mentioned, such as the Sparrow population dataset, seem to be in a tabular format, possibly CSV, given the mention of habitat variables like food, temperature, and population size. However, there is no direct mention of image, audio, or video data formats. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
