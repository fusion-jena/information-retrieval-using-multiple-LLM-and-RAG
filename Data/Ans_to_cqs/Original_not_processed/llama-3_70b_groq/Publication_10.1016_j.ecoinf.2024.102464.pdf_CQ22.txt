Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), to evaluate species distribution modeling.

The context mentions that the performance of these models is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, which is a critical measure of model performance. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves are used to quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, with the true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) being used to evaluate the model's performance.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics to evaluate the performance of the models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query in the context of the provided information.
