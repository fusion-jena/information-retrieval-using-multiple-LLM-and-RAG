Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to marine science, ecology, and data management, with references to papers on topics such as automated genome annotation, otolith shape and size, and FAIR data principles. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
