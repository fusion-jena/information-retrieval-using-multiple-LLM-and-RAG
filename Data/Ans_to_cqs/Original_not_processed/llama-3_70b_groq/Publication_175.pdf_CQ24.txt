Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on few-shot learning, data augmentation, and classification algorithms, but it does not discuss randomness or seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
