Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning models for ecological informatics, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
