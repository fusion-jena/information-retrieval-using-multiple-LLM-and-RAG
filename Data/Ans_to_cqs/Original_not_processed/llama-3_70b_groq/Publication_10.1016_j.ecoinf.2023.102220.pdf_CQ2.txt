Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of the deep neural network, the activation functions used, and the implementation in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, it does not provide information about the input data format. It is possible that the data format is time series data, given the mention of "time series" in the context, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
