Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that one of the three datasets will be defined as a training base, and the standardization parameters will be calculated and applied to the other two datasets considered as test base. This implies that the data is split into training and test sets, but the specific criteria for this split are not provided.

Additionally, the context does not mention a validation set, which is typically used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training. The HyperBand algorithm is mentioned as an optimization algorithm, but it is not clear how it is used to split the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
