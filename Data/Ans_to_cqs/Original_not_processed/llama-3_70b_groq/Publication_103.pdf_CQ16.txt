Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the experiment results and the methodology used for cross-herbarium transfer learning. It discusses the initialization, training, and testing processes, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning, training completion criteria may include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model, or reaching a certain number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given information.
