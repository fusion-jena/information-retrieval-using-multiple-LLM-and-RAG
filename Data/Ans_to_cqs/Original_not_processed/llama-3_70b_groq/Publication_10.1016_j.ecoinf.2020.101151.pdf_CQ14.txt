Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the spatial resolution of the FWI and FFMC data layers, the nine-cell approach, and its effect on prediction results. It also provides some classification thresholds for vegetation and human impact measures, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the model.
