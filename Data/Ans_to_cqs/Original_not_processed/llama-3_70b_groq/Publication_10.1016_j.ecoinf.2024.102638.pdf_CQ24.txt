Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the dataset is divided into training sets and a test set by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data splitting process to ensure the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of five-fold cross-validation, which involves randomly splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times to evaluate the model's performance. This technique helps to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

However, it does not provide specific information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
