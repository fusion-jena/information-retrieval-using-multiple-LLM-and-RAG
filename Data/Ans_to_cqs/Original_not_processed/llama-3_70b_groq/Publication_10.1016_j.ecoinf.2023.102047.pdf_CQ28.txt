Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The context primarily focuses on the different deep learning models used for seagrass coverage estimation and mapping, their performance metrics, and the datasets used. It does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
