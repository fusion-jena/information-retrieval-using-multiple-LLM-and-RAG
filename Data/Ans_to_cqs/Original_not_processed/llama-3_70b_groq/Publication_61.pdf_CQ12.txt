Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the model architecture, which includes a max pooling operation, flattening of features, and fully connected layers. These components are typical of a CNN, which is commonly used for image classification tasks.
