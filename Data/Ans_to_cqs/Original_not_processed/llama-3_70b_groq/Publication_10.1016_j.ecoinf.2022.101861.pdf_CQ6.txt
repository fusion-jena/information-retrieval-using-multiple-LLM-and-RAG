Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of Kaleidoscope Pro to extract sounds that satisfy certain signal parameters, and the potential for future studies to use machine learning or convolutional neural networks to improve classification. It does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
