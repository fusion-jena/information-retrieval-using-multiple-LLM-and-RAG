Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, including kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF, and their applications in remote sensing. It discusses the use of these algorithms for classification, model tuning, and performance evaluation, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
