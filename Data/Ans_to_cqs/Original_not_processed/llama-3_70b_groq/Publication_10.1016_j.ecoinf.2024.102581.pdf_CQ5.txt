Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, except for ImageNet, which is mentioned in the reference "Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., 2012. ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks." However, it is not clear if ImageNet is used in the proposed approach.

Additionally, the context mentions CVIP100 dataset in section 6.1.2, but it is not clear if this dataset is used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if these datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the only dataset that can be confirmed is ImageNet, and possibly CVIP100, but more information is needed to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
