Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study that uses various data sources, including nighttime lighting data, provincial statistical energy data, and administrative boundary data, to analyze carbon emissions and energy consumption. The paper discusses the methodology, data curation, and software used in the study, but it does not mention data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
