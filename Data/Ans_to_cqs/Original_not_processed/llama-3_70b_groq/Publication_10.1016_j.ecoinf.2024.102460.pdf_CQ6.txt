Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on land use change modeling, simulation, and prediction using various models such as LSTM, FMOP, Markov chain, and PLUS models. It discusses the application of these models in different studies, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data, reduce the effect of outliers, and improve the model's performance. But, without specific information from the context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query.
