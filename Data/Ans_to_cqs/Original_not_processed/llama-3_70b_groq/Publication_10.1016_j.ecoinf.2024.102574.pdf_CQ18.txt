Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to forest ecology, remote sensing, and biomass estimation, but it does not provide any information about machine learning model training or evaluation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training based on the provided context.
