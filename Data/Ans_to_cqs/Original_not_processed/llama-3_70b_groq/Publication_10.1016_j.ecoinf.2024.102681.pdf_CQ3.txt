Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to drought assessment and prediction, and discusses the use of hybrid deep learning models such as CNN-LSTM to capture the complex process of drought propagation. It mentions the use of a sliding window method to generate datasets, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
