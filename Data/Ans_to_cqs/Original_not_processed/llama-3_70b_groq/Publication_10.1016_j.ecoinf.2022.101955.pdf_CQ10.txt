Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, machine learning, and land use/land cover mapping, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. The references cited are academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
