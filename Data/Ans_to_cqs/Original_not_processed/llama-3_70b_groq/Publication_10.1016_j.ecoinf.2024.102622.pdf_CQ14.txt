Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of different machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, MLP, and XGboost) for predicting chlorophyll content and crop coverage, and presents the results of the models using validation sets. It also lists various vegetation indices (VIs) and their formulas, but does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used for hyperparameter optimization.
