Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only discusses the architectures of the pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) and their performance on the task of plant species classification. It also mentions various papers and methods related to deep learning, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.
