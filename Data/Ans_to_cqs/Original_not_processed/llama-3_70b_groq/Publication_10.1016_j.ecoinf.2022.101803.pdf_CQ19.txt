Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses ensemble methods like bagging and boosting, and mentions XGBoost, which is an extreme gradient boosting framework. It also mentions random forests and Gaussian mixture components, but does not provide information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
