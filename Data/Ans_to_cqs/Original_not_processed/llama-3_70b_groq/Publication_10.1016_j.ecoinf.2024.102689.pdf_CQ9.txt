Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. The context discusses various research papers and studies on animal individual recognition, fish recognition, and underwater target detection using deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store and share the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
