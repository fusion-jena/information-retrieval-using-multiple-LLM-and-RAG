Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be related to a research article on species distribution modeling using random forests, and it provides references to various sources such as research papers, books, and websites (e.g., GBIF, Harvard University Press). However, there is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
