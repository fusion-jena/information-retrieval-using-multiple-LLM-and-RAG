Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of deep learning models, specifically XGBoost, to detect and categorize forest types using remote sensing data. It includes tables and figures showing the results of the model's performance, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
