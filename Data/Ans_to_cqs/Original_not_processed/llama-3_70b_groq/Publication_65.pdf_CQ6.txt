Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used to make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better. The data augmentation techniques used include rotation, noise, and flip, which were applied to augment the dataset by six times. 

It can be inferred that the input patches of size 256 Ã— 256 pixels were used as is, without any specific preprocessing steps mentioned. The context focuses more on the training protocol, hyperparameters, and evaluation process of the different CNN architectures. Therefore, it is unclear what preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning models.
