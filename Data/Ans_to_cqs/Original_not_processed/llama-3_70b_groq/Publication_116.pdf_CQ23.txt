Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors attempted to address the issue of bias in the dataset by creating two different datasets: a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset.

In the biased dataset, 70% of the data was randomly taken for training and 30% for testing, but this distribution was not strictly followed due to the varying number of photos per species. This approach is similar to what previous plant identification studies have followed.

In the unbiased dataset, the authors attempted to approximate a 70%-30% distribution by using the unique specimen identifier to place images from the same specimen in either the training dataset or the testing dataset. This was done to avoid the Species-Specific Photo Bias (SSPB).

While these approaches can be seen as attempts to increase the generalizability of the model, they do not explicitly involve techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
