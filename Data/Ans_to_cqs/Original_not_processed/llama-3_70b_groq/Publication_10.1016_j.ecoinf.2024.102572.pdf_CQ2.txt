Answer::: 
Answer: Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the obtained data is saved in "CSV" format on Google Drive for later examination. There is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite photos are used on a cloud platform, which suggests that image data might be involved. But there is no clear indication of its format. Therefore, the only confirmed data format used in the pipeline is CSV.
