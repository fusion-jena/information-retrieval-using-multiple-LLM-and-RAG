Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article in the field of ecological informatics, discussing topics such as time series analysis, machine learning, and trend analysis. The references cited are mostly related to statistical analysis, ecology, and climate change, but do not provide any information about deep learning or data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
