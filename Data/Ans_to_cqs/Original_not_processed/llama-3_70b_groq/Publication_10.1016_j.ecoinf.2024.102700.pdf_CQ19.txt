Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses various modelling approaches used in the examined articles, including Regression-based, Machine-learning, distance-based/envelope, Point Process Models, Ensemble approach, and Others. It also lists specific models implemented in the reviewed literature, such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and others. However, it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
