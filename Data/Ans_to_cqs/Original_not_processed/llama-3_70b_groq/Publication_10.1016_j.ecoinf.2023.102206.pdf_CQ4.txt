Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that Sousa et al. (2020) proposed a transfer learning approach with data augmentation techniques for wildfire detection to overcome data limitations, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
