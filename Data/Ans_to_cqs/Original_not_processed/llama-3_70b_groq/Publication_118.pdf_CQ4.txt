Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the network architecture and the autoencoder-based feature representation for ecoacoustic analysis. It discusses the input layer, convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and decoder network, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
