Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and a brief description of a study area, but it does not provide information about the specific methods used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

The reference to "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" suggests that the study involves the use of deep learning models, but it does not provide details about the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
