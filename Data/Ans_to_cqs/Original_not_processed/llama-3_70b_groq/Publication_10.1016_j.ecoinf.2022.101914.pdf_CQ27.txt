Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on building and evaluating ecological models, specifically ensemble models, and discusses procedures for subsetting background points, training individual models, and evaluating model performance. There is no mention of deep learning models or deployment processes.
