Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on species presence prediction, and it discusses various loss functions and their performance on different datasets. It also provides tables showing the mean AUC performance of different models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
