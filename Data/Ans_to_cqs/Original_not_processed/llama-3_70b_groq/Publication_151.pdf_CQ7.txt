Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that when applying the model in practice on real data, it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set. This implies that the data can be split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria for this split are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that one can "first randomly select a subset of the reference species as the validation set, use these as testing data to tune the parameters for the given data set, and then train one last time with all the data with the fine-tuned parameters." This suggests that the validation set is a random subset of the reference species, but again, the specific criteria for this split are not provided.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit criteria for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets, but it does mention the use of a validation set for fine-tuning hyperparameters.
