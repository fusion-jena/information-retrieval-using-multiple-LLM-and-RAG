Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the ResNet-50 model, its training process, and the comparison of its performance with other variants. It also mentions the time taken to complete certain tasks on the CPU and GPU, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model based on the given context.
