The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text does not mention popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears that the authors have created their own dataset for training and testing their CNN model. The dataset consists of repeat photographs, which are split into 50x50 pixel tiles for training and testing. The positive class consists of woody vegetation, while the negative class includes grass, open soil, buildings, human, animals, sky, water, stone, and asphalt.
