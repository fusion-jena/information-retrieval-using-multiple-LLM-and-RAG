Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that the pre-trained models (such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2) have been trained on "large-scale datasets" and "extensive datasets", but it does not provide the names of the datasets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
