Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model for Apis suitability, using the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b, and discusses the validation of the Apis-FIS model. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
