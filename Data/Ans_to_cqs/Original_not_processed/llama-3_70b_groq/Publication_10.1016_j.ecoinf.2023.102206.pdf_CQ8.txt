Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and references related to machine learning, transfer learning, and environmental sustainability, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
