Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the initialization of the emission distribution parameters (B) using a sequential combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
