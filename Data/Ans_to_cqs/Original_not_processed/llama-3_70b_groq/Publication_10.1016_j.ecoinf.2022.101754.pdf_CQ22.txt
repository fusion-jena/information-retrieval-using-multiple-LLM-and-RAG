Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the evaluation of machine learning models for above-ground biomass estimation. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are:

1. AD (average angle deviation from the line 1:1 for test samples) in degrees.
2. ACT1 (accuracy with tolerance 15 t/ha ± 10% of AGB [t/ha]).
3. ACT2 (accuracy with tolerance 10 t/ha ± 5% of AGB [t/ha]).
4. RMSE (root mean squared error) in t/ha.
5. R2 (coefficient of determination).
6. Diff_R2 (the difference between R2_test and R2_all).
7. CV_R2 (cross-validation R2).

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, but they do not include precision and recall, which are typically used in classification problems.
