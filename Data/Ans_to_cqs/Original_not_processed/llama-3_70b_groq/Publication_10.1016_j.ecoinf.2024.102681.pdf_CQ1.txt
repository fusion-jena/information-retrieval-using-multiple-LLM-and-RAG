Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, drought propagation, and the utilization of the model for predicting drought propagation time. It does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study spans from January 1950 to December 2020, which suggests that the data might be obtained from existing public datasets or historical records. Additionally, the study mentions the use of a sliding window method to generate 42 distinct datasets, which implies that the data is likely to be time-series data. But the exact method of data collection is not specified.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
