Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The references cited are mostly academic papers and do not provide a direct link to a data repository. The only online resource mentioned is a GitHub repository (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet), which is related to the Darknet framework used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not seem to be the data repository of the pipeline itself. Additionally, the supplementary data is mentioned to be available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101786, but it is not clear if this is the data repository of the pipeline.
