Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the selection and parametrization of six open-source CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0) and the use of the Adam optimizer algorithm for model optimization. However, it does not provide information about the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used.
