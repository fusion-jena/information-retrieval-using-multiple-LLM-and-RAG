Answer::: 

The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide the ratio used for splitting the data, which is 70% for training, 10% for testing, and 20% for validation. This is a common practice in machine learning, where the data is split into these three sets to evaluate the model's performance during training and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.
