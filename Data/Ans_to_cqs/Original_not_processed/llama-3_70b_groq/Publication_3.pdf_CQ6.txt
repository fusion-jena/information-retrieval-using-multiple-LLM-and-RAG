Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the use of transfer learning with Inception v3. It also discusses the calibration of models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation, among others. Normalization and scaling are used to ensure that the input data is within a suitable range for the model, while cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Data augmentation is used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps used in this particular case, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
