Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, forestry, and ecology, with references to various studies on topics such as biomass estimation, tree species classification, and LiDAR data. However, it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a deep learning model, including measures taken to ensure its generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
