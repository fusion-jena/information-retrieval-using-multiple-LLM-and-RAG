Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and performance of various models, including ViT, ResNet, and CA-Hybrid, but does not provide information about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training.
