Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research article about predicting the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls using machine learning ensemble predictions, and it discusses various aspects of the research, such as data sources, geographic information systems, and model diagnostics. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
