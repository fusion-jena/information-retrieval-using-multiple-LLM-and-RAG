Answer::: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors employed 5-fold cross-validation. They divided the CLO-43SD dataset into 5 folds and performed cross-validation, reporting the results as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and reduces overfitting. Additionally, the authors used data augmentation, which can also contribute to the model's generalizability by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset and exposing the model to a wider range of variations in the data. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the dataset is diverse or if stratified splitting was used.
