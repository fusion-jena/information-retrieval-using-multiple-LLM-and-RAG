Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, machine learning, and ecological informatics, with no direct reference to deep learning pipeline or data bias handling techniques.

However, it does mention various machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, random forest, and maximum entropy modeling, which can be used for data exploration, prediction of ecological patterns, and pattern recognition. Additionally, the context discusses the use of ensemble models to improve the power of prediction by integrating different models.

But, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
