Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline mentioned are:

* Oversampling: Specifically, minor category oversampling (Rayhan et al., 2017) is mentioned as a technique to address unbalanced training data.
* Undersampling: Major category undersampling (Freeman et al., 2012) is also mentioned as a technique to address unbalanced training data.
* Combinations of oversampling and undersampling: Naboureh et al. (2020) explored combinations of these techniques to address unbalanced training data.

There is no mention of stratified splitting or diverse data collection in the provided context. It is possible that these techniques may be used in other contexts, but they are not mentioned in this specific passage.

It is worth noting that the context focuses on addressing unbalanced training data in the specific context of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping, and the techniques mentioned may be specific to this domain.
