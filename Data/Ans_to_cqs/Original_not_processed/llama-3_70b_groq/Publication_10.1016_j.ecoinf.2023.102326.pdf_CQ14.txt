Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be discussing ecological informatics, land use types, and network measures, but it does not provide information about a specific model or its optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
