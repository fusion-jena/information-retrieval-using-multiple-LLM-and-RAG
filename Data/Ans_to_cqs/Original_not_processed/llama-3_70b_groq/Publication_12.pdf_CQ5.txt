Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used are custom datasets created for the specific task of bat species classification. The datasets consist of images of bat calls, which were resized from 256*256 pixels to 64*64 pixels to reduce training time and memory usage. The datasets are divided into a training dataset with 85% of the images (111,244 images) and a validation dataset with 15% of the images (19,614 images).
