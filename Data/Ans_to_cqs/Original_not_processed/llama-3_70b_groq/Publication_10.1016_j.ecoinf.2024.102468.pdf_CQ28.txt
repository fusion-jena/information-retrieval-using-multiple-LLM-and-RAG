Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context discusses the WT-HMM model and its performance evaluation, as well as comparisons with other machine learning models and feature extraction methods. It also cites several references related to whale vocalizations, feature extraction, and complex systems. However, there is no mention of a specific platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) used to deploy the deep learning model.
