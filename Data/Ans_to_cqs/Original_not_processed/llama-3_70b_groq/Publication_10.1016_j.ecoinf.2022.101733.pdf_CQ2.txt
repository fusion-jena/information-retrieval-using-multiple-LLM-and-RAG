Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves multi-source remote sensing (RS) images, including optical and radar time series data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. The data formats are likely to be raster images, such as GeoTIFF or JPEG, which are commonly used in remote sensing applications. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral indices, textural features, and DSM (Digital Surface Model) data, which may be stored in formats like CSV or JSON. However, the exact data formats used in the pipeline are not specified.
