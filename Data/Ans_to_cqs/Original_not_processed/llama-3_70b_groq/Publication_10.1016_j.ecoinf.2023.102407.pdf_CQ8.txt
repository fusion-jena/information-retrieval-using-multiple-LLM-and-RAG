Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context appears to be a collection of references to academic papers and a list of environmental variables (BIOCLIM_09 to BIOCLIM_19) used in species distribution prediction. There is no mention of a code repository or a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository.
