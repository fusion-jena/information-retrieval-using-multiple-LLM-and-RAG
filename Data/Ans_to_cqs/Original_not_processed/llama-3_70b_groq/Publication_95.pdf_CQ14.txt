Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, and the approach used to split the data. It also presents the results of training a ResNet50V2 model with different input image sizes and annotation sizes. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
