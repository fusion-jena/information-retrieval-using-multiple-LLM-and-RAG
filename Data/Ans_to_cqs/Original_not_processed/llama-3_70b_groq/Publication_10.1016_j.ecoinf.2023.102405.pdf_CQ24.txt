Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the AODEGRU model for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture. It discusses the model's components, such as the hidden state update, attention scores, and loss calculation, but does not address randomness or random seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
