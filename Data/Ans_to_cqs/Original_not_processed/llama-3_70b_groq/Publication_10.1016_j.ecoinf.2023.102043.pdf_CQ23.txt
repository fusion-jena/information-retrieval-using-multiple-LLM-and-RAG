Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. This suggests that some form of splitting was used, but it is not clear if it was stratified or not. 

Additionally, the context does not provide information about the diversity of the dataset or if cross-validation was used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
