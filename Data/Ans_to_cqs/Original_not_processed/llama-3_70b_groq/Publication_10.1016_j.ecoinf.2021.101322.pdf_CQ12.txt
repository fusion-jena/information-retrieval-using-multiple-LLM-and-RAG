Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, specifically in the section "2.3. Implementation and training" where it states "The CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python...". Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a specific CNN architecture called EfficientNet-B4.
