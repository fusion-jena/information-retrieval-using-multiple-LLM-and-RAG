Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context varies. 

In the context of Mobilenetv2, the purpose is not explicitly stated, but based on the name, it can be inferred that it is likely used for image classification tasks.

In the context of Bottleneck Transformers, the purpose is visual recognition, which can include tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

EfficientNet and EfficientNetV2 are also used for image classification tasks.

YOLOv7 is used for object detection tasks.

The underwater holothurian target detection algorithm is used for target detection in underwater scenes.

Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks are used for image classification tasks.

CenterNet is used for object detection tasks.

The purpose of the other models mentioned, such as Sigmoid-weighted Linear Units, is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it can be inferred that they are used for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning.

It's worth noting that the purpose of the models might not be limited to the tasks mentioned above, as deep learning models can be used for a wide range of applications.
