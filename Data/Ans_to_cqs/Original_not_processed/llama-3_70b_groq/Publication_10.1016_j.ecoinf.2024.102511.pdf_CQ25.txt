Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions the use of deep neural networks for bioacoustic classification, specifically for classifying large datasets of marine mammals. The model is trained to classify audio signals or echolocation clicks into different categories, such as species of dolphins. The goal is to improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of analyzing large datasets.
