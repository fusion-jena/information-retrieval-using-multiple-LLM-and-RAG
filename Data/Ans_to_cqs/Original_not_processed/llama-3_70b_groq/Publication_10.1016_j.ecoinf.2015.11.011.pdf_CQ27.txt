I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on image segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, and the development of new methods and tools for automatically selecting segmentation parameters. It does not provide information on the deployment of trained models.
