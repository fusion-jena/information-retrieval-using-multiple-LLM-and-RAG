Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions data augmentation techniques used for plant image classification, which include random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques are used to collect all possible cases and ensure that the model is robust to different variations in the input data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
