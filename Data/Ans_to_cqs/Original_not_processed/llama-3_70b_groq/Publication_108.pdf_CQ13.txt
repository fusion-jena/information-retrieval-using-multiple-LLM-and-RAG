Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the learning rate, which is one of the hyperparameters. According to Table 1, the learning rates used in the hyperparameter fine-tuning process are 0.001, 0.01, and 0.0005. 

Additionally, the context describes the architecture of the model, which is a U-net architecture with a varying number of blocks and filters. The number of blocks and filters used in each scenario is also provided in Table 1. 

However, the optimizer used in the model is not specified in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the answer to that part of the query.
