Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers and articles related to remote sensing, ecological informatics, and machine learning. It discusses different techniques and models, including LightGBM and XGBoost, but does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.
