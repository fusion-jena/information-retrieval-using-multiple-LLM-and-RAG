Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1-measure, true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). 

These metrics are used to evaluate the CNN-detection results in Test-zone-1 at different sliding window sizes, as shown in Table 3. The precision, recall, and F1-measure are calculated using the true positives, false positives, and false negatives. The formulas for precision and recall are not explicitly stated in the context, but they are commonly defined as precision = TP / (TP + FP) and recall = TP / (TP + FN). The F1-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as F1 = 2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall).
