Answer:::
Answer: According to the provided context, the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is the class-weighted technique. This technique is used to balance the dataset, as deep learning models have a bias towards classes with a large number of images. The class-weighted technique is implemented in two steps: first, the class weights are calculated using the compute_class_weights function from the sklearn library in Python, and then these weights are used as inputs to train the model. This approach helps to mitigate the bias towards majority classes during training. There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context.
