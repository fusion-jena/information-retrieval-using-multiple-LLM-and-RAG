Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing a deep learning architecture and its performance on underwater image enhancement tasks, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
