Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay. This is mentioned in equation (1), where the loss function J(w) includes a term λR(w), which represents the weight decay with the Lagrange multiplier λ. This term helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function for large weights.

There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context. However, it is a common regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but it is not mentioned in this specific context.

It's worth noting that fine-tuning the entire network is not used when the new dataset is small, as it can lead to overfitting, especially in the first layers of the network. Instead, the last learnable layers of the CNN are gradually adjusted to the particularities of the problem, which helps to prevent overfitting.
