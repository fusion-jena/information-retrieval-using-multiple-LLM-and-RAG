Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is hyperparameter optimization using both random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods. This is mentioned in the context as "Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which were implemented using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7)". This suggests that the model performance was monitored and optimized during training by tuning the hyperparameters using these two methods.
