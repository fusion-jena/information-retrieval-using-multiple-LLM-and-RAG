Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-net, and semantic segmentation, for vegetation classification and object detection in remote sensing imagery. It discusses the use of satellite data and various spectral bands, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques employed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
