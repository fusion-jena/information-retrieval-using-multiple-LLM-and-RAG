Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of early stopping technique to avoid over-fitting in the training process. Early stopping is a regularization technique that stops the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting the training data.
