Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of optical images and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The context mentions that for every reference data patch, an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one ascending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one of the optical image are randomly picked.

It can be inferred that the optical images and SAR images are collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellites or aerial vehicles. However, the specific methods or sources of these images are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of NIBIO's Norway-wide timber volume map, which suggests that public datasets or existing maps may also be utilized as a source of raw data.

It is important to note that the context does not provide information on the use of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these methods are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline appear to involve the use of optical images and SAR images collected through remote sensing technologies, as well as public datasets or existing maps.
