Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the deep learning approach used for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, specifically discussing the BatNet model and its modifications. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data might be in the form of audio recordings of bat calls, as the context mentions acoustic signal synthesis and feature extraction from low-level features (e.g., pixels in images) to high-level features (e.g., frequency, bandwidth). But the exact methods used for collecting these audio recordings are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
