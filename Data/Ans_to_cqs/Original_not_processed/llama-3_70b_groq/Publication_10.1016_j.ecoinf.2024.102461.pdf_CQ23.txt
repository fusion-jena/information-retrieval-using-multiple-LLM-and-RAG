Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it mentions the use of Jenks' natural break classification method and machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
