Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is image classification, specifically animal classification. This is inferred from the text, which mentions "animal classification results" and "image classification problems" in the context of discussing the performance of deep learning models such as EfficientNetV2 and Vision Transformers (ViT). Additionally, the text mentions the use of these models for image classification tasks, such as classifying images from camera traps.
