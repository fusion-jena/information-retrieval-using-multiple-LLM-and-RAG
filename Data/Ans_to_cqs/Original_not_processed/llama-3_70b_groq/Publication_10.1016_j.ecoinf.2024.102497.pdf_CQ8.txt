Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a collection of references to research papers and a description of a method using CART and Random Forest regression models for predicting water depth from satellite imagery. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
