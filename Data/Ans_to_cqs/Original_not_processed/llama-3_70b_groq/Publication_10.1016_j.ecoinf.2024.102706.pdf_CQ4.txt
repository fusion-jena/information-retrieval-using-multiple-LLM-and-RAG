Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, and its advantages over other tree-based methods. It also briefly mentions the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
