Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, machine learning, and ensemble forecasting, but it does not delve into the details of preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and others, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature selection, and data augmentation, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
