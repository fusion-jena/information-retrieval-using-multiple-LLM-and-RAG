Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The text discusses discriminant analysis for species and sex identification, and mentions the use of linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane. It also mentions the use of a logistic regression model to quantify uncertainty in classification.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, as no such model is mentioned in the context. If the context were to discuss a deep learning model, typical metrics used to evaluate its performance might include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc. However, without any mention of a deep learning model, it is not possible to provide an answer to this query.
