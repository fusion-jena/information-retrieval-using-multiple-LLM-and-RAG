Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, remote sensing, and sample selection strategies for citrus and non-citrus classes. It discusses the use of automatic and semi-automatic methods for sample selection, but it does not touch on deep learning or randomness in a pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
