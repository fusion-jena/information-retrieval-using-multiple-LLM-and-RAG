Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions "CNN architectures" and "convolutional depth layer" in the context of the model's hyperparameters. Additionally, the text references specific CNN models such as ResNetV50, InceptionNetV3, and EfÔ¨ÅcientNetB0, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
