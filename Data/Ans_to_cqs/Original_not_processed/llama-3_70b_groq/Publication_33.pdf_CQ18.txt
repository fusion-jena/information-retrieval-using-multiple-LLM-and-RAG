Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the two-phase approach for building a classification model, where the first phase involves training a CNN on a database T0, and the second phase involves tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using a second and independent database T1. 

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using a cross-validation approach, as mentioned in Table 3, which shows the accuracy of the model without post-processing and with post-processing according to three goals. This suggests that the model performance is monitored and evaluated during the training process, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring are not explicitly stated.

In summary, the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and it is unclear what specific strategy is implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
