Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to metadata templates for collecting and organizing data from field measurements, including installation details, sensor information, and data file descriptions. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, or any process related to deploying such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
