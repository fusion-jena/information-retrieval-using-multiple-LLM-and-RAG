Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The text discusses the cblindplot package, its potential applications, and references to various research papers, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
