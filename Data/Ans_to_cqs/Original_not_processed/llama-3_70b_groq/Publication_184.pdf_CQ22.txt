Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and mean average precision (AP). These metrics are used to assess the object detection performance of the YOLO-Fish model. 

Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Recall is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). 

Mean average precision (AP) is another evaluation metric used in this study. It shows the overall performance of the model under different confidence thresholds. AP is calculated as the sum of the differences in recall multiplied by the interpolated precision at each recall level.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in detecting fish objects in images. The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which relates true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
