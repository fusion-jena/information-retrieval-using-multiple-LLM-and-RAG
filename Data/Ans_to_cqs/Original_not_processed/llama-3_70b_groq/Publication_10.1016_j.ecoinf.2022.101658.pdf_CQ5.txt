Answer: 

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study uses field measurements and raw photos collected from three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). The manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at PM and CL. The field measurement data and raw photos from the CK field site were used solely for independent validation.
