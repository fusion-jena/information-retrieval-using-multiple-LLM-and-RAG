Answer:::
According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Validation Accuracy: measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset.
2. Precision: quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive.
3. Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate): measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
4. F1-score: not explicitly defined in the context, but it is commonly used in conjunction with precision and recall to evaluate the performance of classification models.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of classification models, as shown in Table 8, which compares the performance of various deep learning models using these metrics.
