Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to discriminant analysis, specifically linear discriminant analysis, and discusses the use of training, test, and validation sets for species and sex discrimination. 

However, in general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically involve random sampling or stratified sampling to ensure that the training, test, and validation sets are representative of the overall data distribution. The specific proportions of the data allocated to each set can vary, but common practices include 60-80% for training, 15-20% for validation, and 5-10% for testing. 

In the provided context, the sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups are given in Table 1, but the criteria used to split the data are not explicitly stated.
