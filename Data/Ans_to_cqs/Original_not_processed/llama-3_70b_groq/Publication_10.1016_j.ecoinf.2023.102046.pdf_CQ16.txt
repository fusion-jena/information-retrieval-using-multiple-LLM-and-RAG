Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses hyperparameter tuning for linear regression, SVC, and ridge regression models, but it does not specify how to determine when the training process should stop. 

Typically, criteria such as validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance metrics, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs are used to determine when training is complete. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used in this case.
