Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "empty camera trap image recognition" and the use of the ResNext-101 model, which is commonly used for image classification tasks, it can be inferred that the purpose of the model is likely image classification. The model is likely trained to classify images as either "empty" or "not empty" camera trap images.
