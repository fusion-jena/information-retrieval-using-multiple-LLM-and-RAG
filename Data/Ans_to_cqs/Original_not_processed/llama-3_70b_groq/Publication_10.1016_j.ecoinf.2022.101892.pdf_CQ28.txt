Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained on an Nvidia V100 GPU using Pytorch, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used for deployment.
