Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It discusses the architecture and functionality of LaDeco, a landscape decomposition tool, including loading pre-trained models, setting thresholds, and output formats. It also mentions the computational workflow and efficiency of the system. However, it does not provide any information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
