Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the evaluation of different pose models, the computation of success probabilities, and the design of experiments, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
