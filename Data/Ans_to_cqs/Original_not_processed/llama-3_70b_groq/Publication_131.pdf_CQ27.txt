Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the design and training of the CNN classification system, including data augmentation, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it is mentioned that the cyber system is responsible for interacting with the final user (biologist) and updating the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or their digital twins to carry out simulations or cooperative classifications. This suggests that the deployment process might involve some form of model serialization and platform selection, but the specific details are not provided.

In summary, I don't know the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
