Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This suggests that the approach might be using object detection, possibly with bounding box annotations. However, it does not provide further details on the specific annotation techniques used.
