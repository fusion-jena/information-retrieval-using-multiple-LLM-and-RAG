Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The text discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, machine learning techniques, and the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for analysis. It also mentions the use of different bands and image features for segmenting and classifying images, but it does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria.
