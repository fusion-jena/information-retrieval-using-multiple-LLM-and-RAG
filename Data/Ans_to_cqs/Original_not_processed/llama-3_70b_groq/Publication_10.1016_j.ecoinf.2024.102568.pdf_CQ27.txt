Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training of the LSTM model, the use of a dropout layer to avoid overfitting, and the preprocessing of the training set using a MinMaxScaler. It also compares the performance of the LSTM model with VR + SVR and discusses the database structure used to store information related to air quality sensors and legal stations. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
