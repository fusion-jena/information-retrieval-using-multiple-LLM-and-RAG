Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses habitat classification using machine learning algorithms, specifically the XGBoostClassifier, and mentions the use of optimized random trees to classify vegetation types. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
