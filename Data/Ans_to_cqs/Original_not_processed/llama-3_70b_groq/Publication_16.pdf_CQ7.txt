Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split, indicating that the data was split into training and testing sets. Additionally, Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the test and validation data during model training, implying that the data was also split into a validation set. Unfortunately, the specific criteria used for this split are not provided.
