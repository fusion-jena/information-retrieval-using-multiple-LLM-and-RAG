Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to biodiversity and spatial analysis, discussing concepts like species richness, bioregions, and grid sizes, but it does not provide any information about machine learning models or their optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
