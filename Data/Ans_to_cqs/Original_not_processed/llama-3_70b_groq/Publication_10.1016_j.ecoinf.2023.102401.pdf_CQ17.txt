Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on feature extraction, feature fusion, and object detection architectures, such as FPN, PANet, and BiFPN. It also discusses the SRC3 block and its role in feature extraction. However, it does not provide information on regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
