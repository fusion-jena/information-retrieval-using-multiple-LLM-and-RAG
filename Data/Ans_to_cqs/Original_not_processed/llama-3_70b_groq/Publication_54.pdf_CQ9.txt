Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of transfer learning for recognizing endemic bird species, the architecture of the deep learning model, and the experimental setup. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the data repository is available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other platform.
