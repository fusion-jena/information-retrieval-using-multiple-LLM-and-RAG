Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text discusses model evaluation, model-based integration, and the challenges of validating species distribution models (SDMs), but it does not provide specific information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
