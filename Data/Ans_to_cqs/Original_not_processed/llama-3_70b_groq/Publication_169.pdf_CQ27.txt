Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, system requirements, model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation of the proposed CNN-LSTM model. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
