Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in all the references. However, in some cases, it can be inferred. 

For instance, in the paper by Navares and Aznarte (2020), the deep learning model, specifically LSTM, is used for predicting air quality. This implies that the purpose of the model is regression, as it is predicting a continuous value (air quality).

In another paper by Chianese et al. (2019), the multi-layer perceptron is used for predicting ambient particulate matter concentration. Again, this suggests that the purpose of the model is regression.

In the figure provided, which is a classified map of Tehran Province, the purpose of the deep learning model (SVM algorithm) is classification, as it is used to classify land cover classes.

In other cases, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated, and it cannot be inferred from the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer for those cases.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model can be inferred as regression in some cases and classification in one case. However, for other cases, the purpose is unknown.
