Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The tables and figures provided show the performance of different models on the IP102 dataset, but they do not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning, training is considered complete when a certain stopping criterion is met, such as a plateau in the validation loss, a maximum number of epochs, or a certain level of accuracy. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
