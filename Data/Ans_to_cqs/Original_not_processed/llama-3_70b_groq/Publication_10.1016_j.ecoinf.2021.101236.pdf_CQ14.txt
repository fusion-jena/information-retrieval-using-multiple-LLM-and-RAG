Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It describes the model architecture, the data collection process, and the challenges of domain shift from focal to soundscape recordings, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used to optimize the hyperparameters.
