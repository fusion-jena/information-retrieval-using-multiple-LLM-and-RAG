Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics, architecture, and parameters of the models, as well as the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
