Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are related to signs of overfitting. Specifically, the model outputs and error outcomes are inspected to check if the model is focusing excessively on data fitting, which may indicate overfitting. Additionally, the number of required epochs is tuned, and if subsequent training has no effect or decreases the algorithm's performance on held-out test data, it may indicate that the model has converged to its most accurate state.

In the context, it is mentioned that the model converged to its most accurate state after 10-30 training epochs, and subsequent training had no effect or decreased the algorithm's performance. This suggests that the training is complete when the model's performance on the test data plateaus or starts to decrease, indicating that further training may lead to overfitting.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned that validation loss plateau is used as a criterion to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot confirm if validation loss plateau is used as a criterion, but it is likely that the model's performance on the test data is monitored to determine when training is complete.
