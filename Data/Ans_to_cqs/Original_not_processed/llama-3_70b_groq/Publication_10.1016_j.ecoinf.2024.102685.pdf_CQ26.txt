Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data collection and preparation process for a random forest classification model, not a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the removal of non-vegetated and mixed pixels to reduce the effects of bias, but it does not mention specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
