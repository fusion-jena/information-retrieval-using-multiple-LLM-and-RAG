Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques in smart farming and IoT-based systems, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
