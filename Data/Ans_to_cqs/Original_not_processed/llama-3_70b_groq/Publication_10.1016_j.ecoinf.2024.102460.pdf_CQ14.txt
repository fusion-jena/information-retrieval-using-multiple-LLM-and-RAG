Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a land use demand model, and it discusses various parameters and equations used in the model, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
