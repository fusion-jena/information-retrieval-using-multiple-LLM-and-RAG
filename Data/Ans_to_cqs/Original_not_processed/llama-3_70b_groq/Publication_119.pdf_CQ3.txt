Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the implementation of a U-Net model using the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which is pretrained on ImageNet, and the challenges of remote sensing applications, especially for tropical forest monitoring due to the lack of sufficient training data. It does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
