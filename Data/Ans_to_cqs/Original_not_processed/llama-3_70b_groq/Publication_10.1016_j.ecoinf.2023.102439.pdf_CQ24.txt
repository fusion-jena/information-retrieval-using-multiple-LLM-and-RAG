Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on various studies and research papers related to ecological informatics, artificial neural networks, and remote sensing. It discusses the use of NARX neural network models for prediction and modeling, but does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
