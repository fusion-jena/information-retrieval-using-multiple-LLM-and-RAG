Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to describe a research study that involves extracting images and analyzing NDVI data using a Code Editor tool, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
