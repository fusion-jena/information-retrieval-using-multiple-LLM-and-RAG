Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses various concepts related to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ecoacoustics, and bird species classification, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

The references cited in the text include papers on deep learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, as well as surveys on automated birdsong recognition and soundscape classification. However, none of these references explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
