Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of humpback whale songs using TensorFlow and Python. 

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and random dropout. By setting a random seed value, the randomness is fixed, and the results can be reproduced.

In the context, the authors do not mention setting a random seed value, but they do mention using TensorFlow and Python for implementing the CNNs. TensorFlow provides a way to set a random seed value using the `tf.random.set_seed` function. However, it is not clear from the context whether the authors used this function or not.

In summary, the context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including setting a random seed value.
