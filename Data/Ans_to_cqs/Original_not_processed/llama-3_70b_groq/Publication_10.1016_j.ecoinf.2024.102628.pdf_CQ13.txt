Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the use of the fast.ai platform and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
