Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated based on its true positive rate and true negative rate. The context mentions that the model had a true positive rate of 89.3% and a true negative rate of 91.9% using a standard acceptance threshold of 0.5, and a true positive rate of 95.7% and a true negative rate of 76.1% using a more conservative acceptance threshold of 0.1. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored by tracking its accuracy in classifying background and foreground images.
