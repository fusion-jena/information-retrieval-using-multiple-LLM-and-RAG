Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, annotation, and training process, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps after model training may include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. to assess the model's performance.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
* Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the most relevant input features contributing to the model's predictions.

However, these are general practices and not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
