Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The tables and text provided appear to describe the results of a model, including the model's performance, classification tables, and variables used in the model. However, there is no information about the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used.
