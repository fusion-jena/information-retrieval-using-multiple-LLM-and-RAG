Answer: 

According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Cropping
2. Flipping
3. Scaling
4. Rotating
5. Adding noise
6. Color transformation
7. Random erasing (as shown in Figure 4(a))

These techniques are used to increase the size of the training set and to obtain a more generalized model, as the objects varied in size, lighting conditions, and poses.
