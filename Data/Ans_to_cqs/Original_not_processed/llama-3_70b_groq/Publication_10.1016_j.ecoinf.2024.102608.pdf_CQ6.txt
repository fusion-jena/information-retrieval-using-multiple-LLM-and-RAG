Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their applications, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. It also briefly discusses the randomized grid search method for exploring the parameter space, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context. However, in general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature selection, and data augmentation, depending on the specific problem and dataset.
