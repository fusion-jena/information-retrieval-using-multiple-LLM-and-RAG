Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to data curation and filtering of occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS using bioregions, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
