Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models, dealing with multi-variate varying length audio data, and the deep learning architecture used for classifying acoustic scenes. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks, not audio classification tasks.
