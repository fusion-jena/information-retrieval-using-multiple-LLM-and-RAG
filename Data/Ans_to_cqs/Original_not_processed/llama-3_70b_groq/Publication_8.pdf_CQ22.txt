Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Average Precision (AP) and Intersection over Union (IoU). Specifically, the context mentions AP50, AP75, and AP, which are variations of the Average Precision metric with different IoU thresholds. AP50 and AP75 refer to the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively, while AP is the average precision over 10 IoU levels from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
