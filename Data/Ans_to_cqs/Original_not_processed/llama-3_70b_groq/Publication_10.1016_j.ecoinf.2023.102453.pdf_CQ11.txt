Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various techniques and models used in deep learning, such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Neural Architecture Search, Vision Transformers, and transfer learning, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
