Answer::: 

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

* 50% increase in brightness
* Half-random rotation
* Random rotation with a factor randomly selected between 0ยบ and 359ยบ
* Random cropping
* Random scale of image size

These techniques are used to artificially increase the number of samples and improve the performance of the CNN-based models.
