Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of fieldwork and annotated data for developing a deep learning model for sub-alpine shrub species identification, and it presents the results of an observer study and a table with performance metrics for different deep learning networks. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
