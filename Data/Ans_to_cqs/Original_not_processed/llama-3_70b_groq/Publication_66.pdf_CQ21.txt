Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics such as specificity, sensitivity, PPV (Positive Predictive Value), and NPV (Negative Predictive Value). Additionally, the construction of a confusion matrix is also implied, as the context mentions correctly predicted dives and non-dives, as well as incorrectly predicted dives and non-dives.

There is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of input features in the model's predictions, but they are not mentioned in the text.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, which are techniques used to evaluate the performance of the model, but these are not postprocessing steps per se.
