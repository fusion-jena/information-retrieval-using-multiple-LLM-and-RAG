Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training procedure of the models, such as adapting a pre-trained VGG16 network, modifying the network structure, and using transfer learning. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
