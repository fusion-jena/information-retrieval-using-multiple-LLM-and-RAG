Answer:::
Answer: The provided context mentions the following hyperparameters used in the deep learning model:

* Batch size: 32
* Initial learning rate: 0.001
* Learning rate decay: exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94

However, the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the optimizer used in the deep learning model.
