Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on semantic segmentation, pixel-wise classification, and deep learning-based methods for image analysis. It discusses various techniques and architectures, such as Deeplabv3+, Conditional Random Fields, and CNN-based feature matching, but does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
