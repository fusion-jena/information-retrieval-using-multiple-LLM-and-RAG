Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are:

1. Correct identification rate: The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify the species. The training is considered complete when the correct identification rate reaches a plateau, beyond which there is no significant improvement.

2. Processing time: The processing time (in hours) is also considered, and the training is stopped when the processing time shows a positive linear relationship with the number of training steps, indicating that further training would not result in significant improvements.

In the case of the Mexican dataset, the optimum number of training steps was determined to be 2,000, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate. The largest gap between the processing time trace and identification rate occurred following this number of steps, indicating that further training would not result in significant improvements.

It is not explicitly mentioned that validation loss plateau is used as a criterion, but the context suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify the species, and the training is stopped when the performance reaches a plateau.
