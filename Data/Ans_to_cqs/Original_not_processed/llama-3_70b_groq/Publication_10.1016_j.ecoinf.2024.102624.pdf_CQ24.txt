Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, ecological informatics, and machine learning techniques for plant population classification.

However, it does mention some general strategies to improve classification accuracy, such as:

1. Training data augmentation to extend the existing training data and enhance generalization capabilities.
2. Post-classification techniques, including segmentation and filtering, to provide better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors.
3. Dealing with the characteristics of the training data, such as excluding outliers, refining the training samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data.

These strategies are more related to improving the overall performance of the classification model rather than specifically handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not addressed in the provided context.
