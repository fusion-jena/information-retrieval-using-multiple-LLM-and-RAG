Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the workflow of preprocessing, network design, and prediction, as well as the hyperparameter fine-tuning results and the architecture of the U-Net model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
