Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions a DOI link (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102291) that points to supplementary data, but it does not specify the type of repository or the link to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
