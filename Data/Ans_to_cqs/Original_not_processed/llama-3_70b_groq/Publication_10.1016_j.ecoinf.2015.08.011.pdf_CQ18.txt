Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping technique. This technique is used to avoid overfitting by stopping the training process when the model begins to overfit the data. The data set is split into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing (validation set). The model error is validated on the validation set, and the training process is stopped when the error on the validation set starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
