Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and techniques used for model assessment and optimization.

For instance, it mentions the use of "percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" indices for assessing variable importance in Random Forest models. It also mentions the use of grid search for optimizing model parameters in both Random Forest and XGBoost models.

However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. These steps are typically used to interpret and evaluate the performance of machine learning models, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
