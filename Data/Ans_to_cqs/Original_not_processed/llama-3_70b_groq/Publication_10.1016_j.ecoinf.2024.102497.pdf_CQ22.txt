Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on bathymetry retrieval methods, including linear and nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques such as CART, RFR, and SVM. It also mentions various studies that utilized these methods to estimate bathymetry from satellite imagery. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model.
