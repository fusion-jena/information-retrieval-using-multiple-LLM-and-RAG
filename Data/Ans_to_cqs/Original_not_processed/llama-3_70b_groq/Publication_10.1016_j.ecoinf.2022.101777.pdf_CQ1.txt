Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from satellite imagery. The context mentions "S2A_MSI_L1C" and "S2B_MSI_2A", which are likely references to Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellite images. The presence of dates and seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) suggests that the data is related to environmental or ecological monitoring.

It can be inferred that the raw data is collected through satellite remote sensing, specifically from the Sentinel-2 satellites. This method is commonly used in ecological and environmental monitoring applications.

However, it is not clear if surveys or public datasets are also used in the deep learning pipeline. The provided context does not mention these methods explicitly. Therefore, it is uncertain whether these methods are utilized in addition to satellite remote sensing.

In summary, based on the context, satellite remote sensing from Sentinel-2 satellites is likely used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the use of surveys or public datasets is unclear.
