Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning approaches and techniques used for satellite image classification, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks, and distributed deep learning methods. It also mentions the use of Apache Spark for large-scale satellite image analytics and BigDL for data parallel training. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
