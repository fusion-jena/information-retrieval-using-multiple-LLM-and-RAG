Answer::: 
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are MNIST and a custom dataset of clusters of extracted numbers from point cloud data. The MNIST dataset is a modified version, with two variations: MNIST(1) which is the original MNIST data, and MNIST(2) which is MNIST data that was changed in size and placement to resemble the custom dataset. There is no mention of CIFAR or ImageNet datasets being used in this pipeline.
