Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not delve into deep learning techniques or regularization methods. The only mention of deep learning is a brief statement about the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for LULC classification, but it does not provide details on the regularization methods used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
