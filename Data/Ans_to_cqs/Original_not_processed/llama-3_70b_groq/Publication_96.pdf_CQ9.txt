Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions Google Cloud Storage and Computing, Google Earth Engine, and Google Cloud Platform, but it does not provide information about a public data repository where the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available.
