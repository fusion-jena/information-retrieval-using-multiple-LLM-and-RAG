Answer:::

Based on the provided context, I don't see any information related to deep learning pipelines or methods for collecting raw data in such pipelines. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, wildlife management, and statistical analysis, with references to reports from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and academic papers on statistical analysis.

There is no mention of deep learning, surveys, sensors, or public datasets in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the given context.

If you have any further questions or would like to provide more context, I'll be happy to help.
