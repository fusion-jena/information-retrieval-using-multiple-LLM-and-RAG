Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on bird sound recognition. Therefore, the data format used in this pipeline is audio. Specifically, the context mentions the extraction of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients from audio data, which is a common feature extraction technique used in audio processing. Additionally, the context mentions the transformation of bird sounds into spectrograms, which is a visual representation of audio data. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
