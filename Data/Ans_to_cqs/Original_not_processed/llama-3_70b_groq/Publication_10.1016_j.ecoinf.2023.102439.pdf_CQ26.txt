Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention feature selection through stepwise regression and principal component analysis as effective preparation techniques to refine prediction accuracy in remote sensing and environmental analysis. 

These techniques can be used to address data bias by reducing the dimensionality of the data and selecting the most relevant features. However, they may not directly address data bias issues such as class imbalance. 

The context does not mention other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
