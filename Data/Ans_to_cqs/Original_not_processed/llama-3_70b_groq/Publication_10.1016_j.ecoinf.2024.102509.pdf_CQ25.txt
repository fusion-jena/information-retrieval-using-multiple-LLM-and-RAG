Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression analysis. The Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model is used to predict continuous variables, which is a characteristic of regression problems. The model is trained to minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target values, indicating that it is designed to predict a continuous output variable. Additionally, the model is used in conjunction with remote sensing data to predict grassland above-ground biomass, which is a typical regression task.
