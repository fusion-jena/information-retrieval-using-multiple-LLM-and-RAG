Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. The context appears to be focused on climate datasets, ecological informatics, and feature selection for machine learning models. It mentions the use of climate extremes indices and bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, as well as simulation data from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). 

However, it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
