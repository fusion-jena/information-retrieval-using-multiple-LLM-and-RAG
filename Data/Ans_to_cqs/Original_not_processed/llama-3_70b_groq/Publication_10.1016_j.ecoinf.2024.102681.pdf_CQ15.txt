Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for drought propagation modeling, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
