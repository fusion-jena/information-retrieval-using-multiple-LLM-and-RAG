Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the concept of overfitting, its relation to privacy attacks, and the training process of a target model and an attack model. It does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the adversary proceeds to query the attack model using both the attack training and test datasets, extracting the resulting prediction vectors for each data point. This suggests that some form of evaluation or analysis is being performed on the model's predictions, but the exact nature of these steps is not specified.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about postprocessing steps involved after model training.
