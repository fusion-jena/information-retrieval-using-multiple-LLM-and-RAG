Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

* Sensitivity (Se)
* Specificity (Sp)
* Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
* Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
* Accuracy (ACC)
* Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

These metrics are defined in Table 3 of the provided context. 

Sensitivity (Se) measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified. Specificity (Sp) measures the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) measures the proportion of true negatives among all negative predictions. Accuracy (ACC) measures the proportion of correct predictions. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is a measure of the quality of the predictions.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context, as shown in Tables 10 and 11.
