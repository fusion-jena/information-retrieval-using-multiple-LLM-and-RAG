Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It describes the STARdbi pipeline and its components, including STARdbi_split_images, STARdbi_train, and STARdbi_inference, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
