Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR). 

The Average Precision (AP) is calculated as the average AP for different IoU thresholds, which are 0.50, 0.55, â€¦, 0.95. AP is also averaged over all classes, which is often referred to as mean average precision (mAP). 

The Average Recall (AR) is averaged over different IoU thresholds and also averaged over all classes. There are two different ARs considered, ARmax=1 and ARmax=10. 

Additionally, two specific AP metrics are mentioned, AP0.50 and AP0.75, which are the AP for IoU threshold 0.50 and 0.75, respectively. AP0.50 is also known as Pascal VOC metric, and AP0.75 is called strict metric in the sense of COCO.
