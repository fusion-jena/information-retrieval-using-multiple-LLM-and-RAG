Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This suggests that the authors may have used a manual tuning approach to optimize the hyperparameters, but it does not provide specific details on the optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
