Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing a random forest model, as it mentions "number of trees ntree = 500; minimum number of observations in a terminal node nodesize = 5; number of variables tried at each split mtry = ⌊Nβ⌋ = 1", which are hyperparameters commonly used in random forest models. There is no mention of deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters.
