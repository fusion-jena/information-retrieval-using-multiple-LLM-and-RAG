Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of an early stop approach with a patience value of 16 to regularize the model and minimize the loss function (binary cross entropy). This suggests that early stopping is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions that the first CNN model layers were kept frozen during training with transfer learning, which can also be seen as a form of regularization.
