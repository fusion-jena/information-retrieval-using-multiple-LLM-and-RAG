Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses various studies on bathymetry retrieval methods, including linear and nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques like CART, RFR, and SVM. However, it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
