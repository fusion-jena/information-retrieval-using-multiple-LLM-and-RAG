Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Bayesian optimizers and TDO to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM models for estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). It discusses the workflow, data preparation, and model selection, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
