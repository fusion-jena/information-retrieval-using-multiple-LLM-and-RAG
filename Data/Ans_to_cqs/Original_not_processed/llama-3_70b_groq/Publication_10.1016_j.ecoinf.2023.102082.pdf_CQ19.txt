Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks was used to derive the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) from Sentinel-2 optical images and GEDI data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
