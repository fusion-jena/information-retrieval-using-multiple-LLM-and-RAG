Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks in ecological prediction, specifically in the context of forest disturbance. It provides references to various studies and datasets, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the example is related to bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests, and the data is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). The context also mentions that more information on the dataset and statistical analyses of the data are provided by Seidl et al. (2016). 

Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting the raw data. It could be surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
