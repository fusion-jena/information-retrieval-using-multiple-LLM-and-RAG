Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various components of a deep learning architecture, such as convolutional layers, residual networks, and feature extraction networks, but it does not provide information about the datasets used to train or test these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
