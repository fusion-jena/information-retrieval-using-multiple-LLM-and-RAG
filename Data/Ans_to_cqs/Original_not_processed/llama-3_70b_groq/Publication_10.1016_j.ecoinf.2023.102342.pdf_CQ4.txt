The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets. There is no mention of deep learning or image processing techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
