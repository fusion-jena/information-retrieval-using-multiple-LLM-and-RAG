Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for image processing and analysis of mangrove forests, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
