Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected using sensors and weather stations. The context mentions a weather station that records weather data at sub-hourly time-steps, and an EC tower that acquires micro-meteorological data, including wind speed, concentrations of H2O vapor and CO2 in the atmosphere, and other variables. The data is stored in a CR3000 datalogger with a 2 GB memory card. This suggests that the raw data is collected through automated sensors and weather stations, rather than through surveys or public datasets.
