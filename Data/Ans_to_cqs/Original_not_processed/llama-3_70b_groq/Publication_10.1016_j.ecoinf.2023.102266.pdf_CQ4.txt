Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be discussing a model for simulating forest fires, and it mentions techniques such as importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for variance reduction, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
