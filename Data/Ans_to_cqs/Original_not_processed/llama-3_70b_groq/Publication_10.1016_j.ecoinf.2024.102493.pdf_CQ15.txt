Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on geographical analysis and statistical methods, including the use of the "GD" package in RStudio for optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD) analysis. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
