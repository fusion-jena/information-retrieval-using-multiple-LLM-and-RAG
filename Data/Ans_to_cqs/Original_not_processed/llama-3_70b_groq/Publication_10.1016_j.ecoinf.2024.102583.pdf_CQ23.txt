Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses heterogeneous ensemble techniques, different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and their applications in Land Suitability Modeling (LSM). It also mentions techniques like bagging (FR = F/E) and weighted average (WA) to mitigate overfitting issues, but it does not provide specific information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
