Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in remote sensing, specifically in image classification tasks. It discusses the use of deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, and their training process. It also mentions the use of high-resolution multi-band imagery and hyper-spectral scenes, but it does not provide information on how these datasets were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
