Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various neural network architectures, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, and their design choices to improve performance. It also mentions data augmentation as a technique to enhance model accuracy, but it does not provide specific information on addressing data bias.

However, it is mentioned that prioritizing images of poorly sampled species with higher error rates could enhance generalization and model accuracy, which implies that the authors are aware of the issue of class imbalance. Additionally, the context suggests exploring new ways of learning and data generation, such as metric learning and generative adversarial networks, to improve error rates for poorly sampled species.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, but it hints at the importance of addressing class imbalance and suggests exploring alternative approaches to improve model performance.
