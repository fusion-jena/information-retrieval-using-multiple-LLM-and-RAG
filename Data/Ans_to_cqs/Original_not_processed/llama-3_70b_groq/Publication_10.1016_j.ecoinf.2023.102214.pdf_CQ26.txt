Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. This technique can be seen as a form of data augmentation, which can help mitigate data bias by increasing the diversity of the training data.

Additionally, the context mentions that data augmentation techniques can enrich a dataset, supplemented by as much as 10Ã— the amount of data, while also reducing overfitting of the model. This suggests that data augmentation techniques are used to address data bias and overfitting, but the specific techniques used (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
