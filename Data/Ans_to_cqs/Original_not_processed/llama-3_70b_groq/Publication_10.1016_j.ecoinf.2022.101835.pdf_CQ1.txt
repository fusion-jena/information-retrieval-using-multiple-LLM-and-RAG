Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, using Optuna and LightGBM libraries. It discusses the hyperparameters and their ranges used for optimization, as well as the performance evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
