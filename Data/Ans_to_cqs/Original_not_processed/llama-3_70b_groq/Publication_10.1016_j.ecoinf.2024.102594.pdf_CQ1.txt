Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the DeepLabV3+ model training process, data augmentation techniques, and the structure of the DeepLabV3+ algorithm. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes. This suggests that the data might have been collected through remote sensing technologies such as satellites or drones, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
