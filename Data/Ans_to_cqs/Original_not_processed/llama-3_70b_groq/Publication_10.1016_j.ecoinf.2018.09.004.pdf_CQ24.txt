Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, and its application to a classification problem in ecology. It discusses the evaluation measure of Accuracy, the use of Random Forest for feature importance, and the application to a seagrass presence-absence problem. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
