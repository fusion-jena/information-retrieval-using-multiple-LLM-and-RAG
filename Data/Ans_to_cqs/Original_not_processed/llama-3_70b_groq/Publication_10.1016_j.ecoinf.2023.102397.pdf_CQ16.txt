Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text describes the process of optimizing the software, creating recognizers, and evaluating their performance, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for the training process. 

It is possible that the training process is completed when the optimal cut-off thresholds are chosen, but the text does not provide clear information about how these thresholds are determined or when the training is considered complete. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
