Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº), Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Prevalence. These metrics were calculated to measure the accuracy and reliability of the model.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model performance. The matrix provides a summary of the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

No mention of Saliency maps is found in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in a model's predictions, but it is not mentioned in the text.

It is worth noting that the context provides a summary of the performance indicators for the random forest classification of maturity condition in Chilean hake for survey and commercial fishing data, which includes the metrics mentioned above. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps that might be involved.
