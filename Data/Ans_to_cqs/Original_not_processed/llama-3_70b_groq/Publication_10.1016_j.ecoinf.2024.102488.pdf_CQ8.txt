Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. The papers mention various machine learning models and algorithms, such as LightGBM and XGBoost, but they do not provide links to code repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of a deep learning pipeline is available.
