Answer:::

According to the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Undersampling: This involves randomly removing samples from the majority classes to balance the dataset.
2. Oversampling: This involves duplicating samples from the minority classes to balance the dataset.
3. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE): This is a more sophisticated approach that augments the dataset by generating synthetic samples based on the feature space and combining features from neighboring samples.

There is no mention of Stratified splitting or Diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.
