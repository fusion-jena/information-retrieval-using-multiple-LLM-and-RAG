Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data splitting and image tiling process, model performance, and the application of the YOLOv5 model on sticky plate images.

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation and model evaluation might be involved, as the context mentions "validate our model's performance" and "emulating the way in which the model will be used in practice." But the specific postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps or creating a confusion matrix, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
