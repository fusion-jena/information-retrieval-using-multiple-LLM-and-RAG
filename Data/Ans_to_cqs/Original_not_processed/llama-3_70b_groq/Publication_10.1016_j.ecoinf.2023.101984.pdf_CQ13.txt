Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing a MaxEnt model, which is a type of machine learning model used for species distribution modeling. The context provides information about the variables used in the model, such as temperature and precipitation factors, and geographical factors like slope. It also mentions the use of clamping maps to project the environmental variables. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer.
