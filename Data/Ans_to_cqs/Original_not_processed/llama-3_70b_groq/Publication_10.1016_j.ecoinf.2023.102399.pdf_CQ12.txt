Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is used in the pipeline. This is mentioned in the abstract of the article "Ecological Informatics" where it states "exploring explainability of a fully convolutional neural network using principal component analysis". This suggests that the authors are using a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) in their approach. However, it is not explicitly stated in the context whether this FCN is used for the biomass estimation task or for some other purpose.
