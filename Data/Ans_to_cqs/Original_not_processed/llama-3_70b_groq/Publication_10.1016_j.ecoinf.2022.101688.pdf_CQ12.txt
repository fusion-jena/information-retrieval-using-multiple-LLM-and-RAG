Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the models mentioned in the context are VGG16, ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, and ResNet50, which are all variants of CNNs. These models are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for bioacoustics research, particularly for classifying animal vocalizations.
