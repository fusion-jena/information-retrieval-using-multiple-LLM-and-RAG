Answer:::

According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, the input data is batch normalized. This is mentioned in section 2.5, Model training, where it is stated that "the inputs are batch normalized before training". There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or normalization. Therefore, it can be concluded that batch normalization is the only preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model in this specific context.
