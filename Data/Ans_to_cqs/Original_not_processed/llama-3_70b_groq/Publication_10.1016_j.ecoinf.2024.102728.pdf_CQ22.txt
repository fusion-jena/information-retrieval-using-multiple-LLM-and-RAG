Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and MI ( Mutual Information). The context provides tables with columns labeled "Total Accuracy" and "MI - 1", "MI - 2", etc., suggesting that these metrics are being used to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not mention other common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a clear explanation of how these metrics are being used or what they represent in the context of the deep learning model. Therefore, without additional information, it's difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
