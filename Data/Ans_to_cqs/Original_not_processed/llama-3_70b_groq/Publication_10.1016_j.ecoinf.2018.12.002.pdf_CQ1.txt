Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, ecological studies, and animal behavior, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the mention of ACC data in the context, it can be inferred that Accelerometer data might be used for collecting raw data in some cases, particularly in studies related to animal behavior. Accelerometers are sensors that measure acceleration, orientation, and vibration, and are often used in wearable devices or attached to animals to collect data on their movements and behaviors.

Beyond this, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
