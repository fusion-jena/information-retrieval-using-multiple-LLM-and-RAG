Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing steps, such as cropping frames from videos, creating a training database, and applying rotations and symmetries to widen the database. It also discusses the creation of additional classes, like "part of fish" and "fish," to improve the localization accuracy.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, the data is divided into these sets in a ratio of 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This split allows the model to learn from the training data, tune its hyperparameters using the validation set, and evaluate its performance on unseen data using the testing set.

Since this information is not provided in the context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
