Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on statistical modeling and data analysis, specifically discussing the use of a penalized loss function for shrinkage estimation and variable selection, and the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) for selecting tuning parameters. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
