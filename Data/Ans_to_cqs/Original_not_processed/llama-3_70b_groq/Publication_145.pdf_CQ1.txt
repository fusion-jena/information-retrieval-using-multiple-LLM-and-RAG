Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically U-net, for identifying features in large amounts of data, including high-resolution imagery, and achieving high accuracy in tasks such as individual tree species mapping in tropical forests.

However, it can be inferred that high-resolution imagery is used as input data, as mentioned in the context. The GeoEye image extents are also mentioned, which suggests that satellite or aerial imagery might be used as a source of data. Additionally, the context mentions PRODES, which is a system for monitoring deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon forest, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
