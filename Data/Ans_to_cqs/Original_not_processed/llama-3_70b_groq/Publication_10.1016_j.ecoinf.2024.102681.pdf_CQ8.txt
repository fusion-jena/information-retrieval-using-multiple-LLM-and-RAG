Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper that discusses a study on drought propagation and uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, but it does not provide any details about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
