Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses object detection tasks, dataset characteristics, and various factors affecting algorithm performance, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

The context does mention validation (Table 3) and metrics such as APs, APm, and APl (Table 4), which are used to evaluate the performance of object detection algorithms. However, it does not specify how these metrics are used to determine when training is complete.

Common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
