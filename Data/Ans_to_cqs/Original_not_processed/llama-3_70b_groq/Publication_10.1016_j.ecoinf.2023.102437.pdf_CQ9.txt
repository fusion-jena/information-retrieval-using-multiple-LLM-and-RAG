Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. The context provides references to various research papers and publications, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
