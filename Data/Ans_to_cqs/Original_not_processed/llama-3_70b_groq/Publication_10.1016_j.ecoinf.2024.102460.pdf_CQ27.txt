Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of LSTM models for time series forecasting, the FMOP model for optimizing land allocation, and the construction of an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP). However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
