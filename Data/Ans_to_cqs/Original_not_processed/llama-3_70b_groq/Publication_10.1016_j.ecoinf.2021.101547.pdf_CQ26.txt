Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges and considerations of using deep learning for image analysis, particularly in the context of wildlife population surveys.

However, it does mention the importance of carefully selecting and manipulating the training images to influence the network to learn particular characteristics and/or assign more importance to certain characteristics than others. This implies that data collection and preprocessing are crucial steps in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
