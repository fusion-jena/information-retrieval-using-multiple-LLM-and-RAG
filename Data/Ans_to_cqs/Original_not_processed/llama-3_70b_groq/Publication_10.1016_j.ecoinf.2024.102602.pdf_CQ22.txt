Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy (ACC), specificity (or True Negative Rate: TNR), sensitivity (or recall or True Positive Rate: TPR), and F1-score (F1). These metrics are commonly adopted for classification tasks and are used to evaluate the model's performance in detecting the presence of Cortaderia selloana in images.
