Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are an RTX 2080 Ti GPU and CUDA. This is mentioned in section 2.3.3. Experimental setting, which states that "a deep learning environment based on Python and Tensorflow â€“ GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows operating system" and that "the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU". There is no mention of TPUs being used.
