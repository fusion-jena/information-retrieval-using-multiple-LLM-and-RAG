Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on presenting the results of a model evaluation, including various metrics such as log likelihood, R-squared values, and classification accuracy. It also discusses the model's performance in predicting "present" and "absent" sample points, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training.
