Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and plots that are typically used to analyze the performance of a model. 

From the context, we can infer that the following postprocessing steps might be involved:

1. Metrics calculation: The context mentions the calculation of mAP (mean Average Precision) values, which is a common metric used to evaluate object detection models.

2. Confusion matrix: The context mentions a confusion matrix (Fig. 6), which is a common tool used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

3. Plotting curves: The context mentions several plots, including the F1 curve (Fig. 7), P curve (Fig. 8), PR curve (Fig. 9), and R curve (Fig. 10), which are likely used to visualize the performance of the model.

4. Visualization of model outputs: The context shows some training batch outputs (Fig. 12) and validation outputs (Fig. 13), which suggest that the model's outputs are being visualized to analyze its performance.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps, which are a type of visualization technique used to understand the model's attention mechanism. Therefore, it is unclear if saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the postprocessing steps involved, it does not provide a comprehensive list of steps.
