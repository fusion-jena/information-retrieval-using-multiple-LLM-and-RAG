Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention that optimal hyperparameter settings are critical to reducing bias in the model predictions (2019). This suggests that hyperparameter tuning is used to mitigate bias, but it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
