Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the Wav2Vec model's pre-training and fine-tuning phases, as well as its application to Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. It does provide loss and accuracy plots (Fig. 12 and Fig. 13) that show the model's performance during training, but it does not specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

However, based on common practices in machine learning, it is likely that the training process is stopped when the validation loss plateaus or reaches a certain threshold, or when a predetermined number of epochs is reached. But this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
