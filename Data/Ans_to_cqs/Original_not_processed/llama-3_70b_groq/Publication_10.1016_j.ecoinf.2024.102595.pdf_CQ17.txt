Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text only mentions that the study aims to "refine predictive modeling by addressing overfitting through sophisticated feature selection and cross-validation methods" but does not specify the regularization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
