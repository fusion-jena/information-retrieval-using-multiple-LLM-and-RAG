Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on clustering approaches to identify freshness classes of fish, evaluating the clustering results using internal methods such as Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz, and determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

There is no mention of training a model or monitoring its performance during training. The context appears to be centered around unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, rather than supervised learning or model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
