Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be discussing remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, and the Google Earth Engine platform, which is a cloud computing platform for remote sensing data. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources used for training such models.
