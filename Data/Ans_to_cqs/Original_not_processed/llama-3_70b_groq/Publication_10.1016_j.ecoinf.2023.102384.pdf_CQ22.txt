Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE). These metrics are used to assess the counting performance of the model. 

MAE measures the average difference between the predicted and ground truth counts, MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and ground truth counts, and MARE measures the average of the absolute relative differences between the predicted and ground truth counts. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the pest counting module (PCθ) and the entire pipeline, which includes the PCθ, DG, and SG modules.
