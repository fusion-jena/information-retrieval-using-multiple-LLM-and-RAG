Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through satellite remote sensing (SRS) services. Specifically, the SMARTLAGOON project has developed an innovative satellite data collection tool that systematically collects water quality data from public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of major space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This tool acquires satellite imagery for predefined geospatial coordinates over a determined period, providing historical and current data insights.

The context also mentions that the tool focuses on Sentinel-3-related products, which offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour, with a high temporal resolution. This suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite instruments such as the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board the Sentinel-3 satellites, which measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 300 m.

Additionally, the context mentions in situ monitoring data sources, such as CSIC-IEO and CARM, which provide sampling data. However, it is not clear if these in situ data sources are directly used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is primarily through satellite remote sensing services, specifically using Sentinel-3-related products and public APIs from ESA and NASA.
