Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some information from the context. 

In the first reference (Nguyen et al., 2019), the authors use an object-based image approach, which suggests that image data might be used in the pipeline. 

In the second reference (Castro and Farias, 2020), the authors model the increment in diameter of individual trees, which might imply the use of CSV or tabular data formats. 

The other references and text do not provide explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used without more information. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data and possibly CSV or tabular data formats might be used in the deep learning pipeline, but this is not explicitly confirmed.
