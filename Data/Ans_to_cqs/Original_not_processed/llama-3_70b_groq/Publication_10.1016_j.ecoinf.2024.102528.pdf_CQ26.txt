Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the BirdNET Analyzer, for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations. It discusses the framework's ability to handle large datasets and detect various bird species but does not delve into the preprocessing steps or techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context. It is possible that the authors may have used certain techniques to address data bias, but this information is not provided in the given text.
