Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, specifically dealing with soil and site parameters. The tables and data presented seem to be focused on statistical analysis and correlation coefficients between various parameters, but there is no mention of deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. These terms are typically associated with machine learning and neural networks, which are not evident in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given information.
