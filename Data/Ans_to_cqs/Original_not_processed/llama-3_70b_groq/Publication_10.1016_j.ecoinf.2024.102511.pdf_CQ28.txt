Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as image data augmentation, passive acoustic surveys, and bioacoustic classification, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
