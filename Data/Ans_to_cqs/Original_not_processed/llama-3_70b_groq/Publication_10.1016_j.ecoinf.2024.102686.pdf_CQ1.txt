Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from various public datasets and sources. The data sources listed in Table 1 include:

* Open Spatial Demographic Data and Research (https://www.worldpop.org) for population density and economic density
* National Meteorological Science Data Center (http://data.cma.cn) for precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration
* Harmonized World Soil Database (https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub) for soil type
* Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (http://www.resdc.cn) for geographic conditions, vegetation conditions, and other data
* Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/) for geographic data

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data. It seems that the data is primarily collected from existing public datasets and sources.
