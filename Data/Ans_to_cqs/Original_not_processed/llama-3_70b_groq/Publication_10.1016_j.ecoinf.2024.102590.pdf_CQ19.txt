Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), will be most effective and useful to map land cover or woody cover in the future. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build such models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
