Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on grasslands, using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), for classification and regression tasks. It discusses the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, QGIS software, and SAGA software for geoscientific analyses. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
