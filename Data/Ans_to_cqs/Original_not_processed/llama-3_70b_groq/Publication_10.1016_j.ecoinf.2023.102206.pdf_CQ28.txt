Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It discusses the use of various techniques such as Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting CO2 emissions and air quality, as well as the use of acoustic data and deep CNN for identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for these models.
