Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated using the values from the confusion matrix, which includes True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN). 

The accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number of outcomes. Precision represents the ratio of true positive predicted values to all positive predicted values. Recall or sensitivity is the ratio of true positive predicted values to the sum of true positive and false negative values. The F1-score is a combined measure of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Faster R-CNN model for automatic identification of crop pests, and the results are compared with other methods such as back propagation (BP) neural network and Single-Shot Detector (SSD) MobileNet.
