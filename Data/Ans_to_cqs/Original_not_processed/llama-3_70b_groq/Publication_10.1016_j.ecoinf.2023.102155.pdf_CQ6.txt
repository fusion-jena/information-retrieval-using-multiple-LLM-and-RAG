Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any preprocessing steps involved in training such models. The context appears to be related to a different topic, discussing intensity prediction maps, regularization, and bias correction in the context of the ppmlasso package. It does not provide any information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
