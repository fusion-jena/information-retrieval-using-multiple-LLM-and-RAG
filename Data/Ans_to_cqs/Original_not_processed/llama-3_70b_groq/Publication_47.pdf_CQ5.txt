Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the pipeline uses datasets derived from digitally available occurrence records of orchid species. These datasets include four groups of features: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. The geographic features include mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and number of locations. The climatic features include 19 bioclim variables. The biome features include presence in 14 biomes, and the anthropogenic features include the mean Human Footprint Index. These datasets are used to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species.
