Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for species distribution modeling, where the model predicts whether a target species is present or not at a given site based on environmental data. The output variable yi is a binary label indicating whether the species is present (1) or not (0) at site i. This is a classic binary classification problem, where the model learns to predict the probability of the species being present or absent based on the input environmental features.
