Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned in the study by Barhate et al. (2023) that they used a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) technique for plant species identification. However, there is no mention of other optimization techniques like Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the only optimization technique mentioned in the context is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with hyperparameter tuning and batch updates.
