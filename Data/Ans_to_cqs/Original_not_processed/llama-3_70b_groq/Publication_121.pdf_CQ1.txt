Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with limited training samples, the concept of transfer learning, and its application in plant identification using MobileNet-based models.

It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
