Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training was performed on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz processor and 32GB RAM memory. This suggests that the model was trained using a CPU, but it does not rule out the possibility of using other hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, the answer is that the model was trained using a CPU, but it is unclear if other hardware resources were also used.
