Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and vegetation index analysis, discussing NDVI products, data processing, and classification methods. The Jenks natural breaks optimization method is mentioned, but it is a statistical technique used for classification, not an optimization technique used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
