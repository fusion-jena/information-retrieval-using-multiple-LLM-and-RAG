Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention "Random erasing data augmentation" in the reference Zhong et al. (2020). This suggests that random erasing is one of the data augmentation techniques used, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that random erasing is one of the data augmentation techniques used, but I do not know the other techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
