Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and others, and their applications in predicting forest canopy cover from satellite data. It also mentions the use of Python libraries and packages, such as Scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm, but does not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository as requested.
