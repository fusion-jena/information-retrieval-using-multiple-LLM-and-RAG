Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the application of CNNs in environmental studies, specifically in water quality classification and algal bloom prediction, and mentions various research papers and architectures used. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
