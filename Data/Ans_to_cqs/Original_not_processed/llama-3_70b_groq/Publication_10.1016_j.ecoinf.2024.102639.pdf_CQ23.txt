Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. To ensure the generalizability of the SVM model, the following measures were taken:

* Cross-validation was used to search for the configuration that minimizes cross-validation error, thereby enhancing model precision.
* A synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation was used to calibrate the regularization parameter (‘C’) and the kernel type (linear), aiming to mediate the balance between model complexity and its generalization prowess.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
