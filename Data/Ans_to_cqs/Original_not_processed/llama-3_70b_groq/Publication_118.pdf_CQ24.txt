Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the autoencoder used for ecoacoustic analysis, as well as the data preprocessing and training procedures. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
