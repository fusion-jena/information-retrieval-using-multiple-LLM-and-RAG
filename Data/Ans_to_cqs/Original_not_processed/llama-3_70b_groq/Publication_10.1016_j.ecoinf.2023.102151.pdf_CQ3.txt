Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on soil science, environmental monitoring, and visualization, with references to papers on topics like digital soil mapping, soil moisture estimation, and data visualization. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision techniques, which are typically associated with data annotation for tasks like object detection and segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
