Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing various aspects of training AI models for image classification, such as reducing internal covariate shift, dealing with reporting biases, and considering taxonomic resolution. However, it does not provide information on how to monitor model performance during training.

If I had to make an educated guess, I would suggest that common strategies for monitoring model performance during training, such as tracking loss and accuracy metrics, validation curves, or early stopping, might be applicable. However, I don't have enough information to provide a specific answer based on the provided context.
