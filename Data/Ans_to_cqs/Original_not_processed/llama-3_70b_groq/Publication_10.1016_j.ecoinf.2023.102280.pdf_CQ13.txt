Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and applications of deep noise reduction methods, particularly in bioacoustics. It discusses the use of U-net architecture, transformer attention mechanisms, and the limitations of existing methods in terms of bandwidth and dataset availability. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
