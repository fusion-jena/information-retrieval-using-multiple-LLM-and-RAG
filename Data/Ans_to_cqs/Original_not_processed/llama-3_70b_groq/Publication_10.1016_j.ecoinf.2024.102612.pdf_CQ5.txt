Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the use of synthetic data simulations and real LiDAR point clouds for semantic classification of fuel types. It mentions the use of MS point clouds collected in Section 2.3 as the ground truth data, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
