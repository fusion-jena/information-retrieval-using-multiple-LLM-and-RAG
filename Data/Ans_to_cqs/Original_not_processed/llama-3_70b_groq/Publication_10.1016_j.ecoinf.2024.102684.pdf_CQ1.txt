Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the context is related to remote sensing and LiDAR data, which are commonly used in deep learning applications for tasks such as semantic segmentation and species classification.

In remote sensing, raw data is often collected using sensors such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scanners, which are mounted on aircraft or satellites. These sensors capture data in the form of point clouds, which can be used to create high-resolution 3D models of the environment.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets, which can be a source of raw data for deep learning models. Public datasets can include datasets from government agencies, research institutions, or other organizations that provide access to remote sensing data.

It is also possible that surveys may be used to collect raw data, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the context. Surveys can be used to collect data on species presence, coverage, or other environmental factors that can be used to train deep learning models.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that LiDAR sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys are used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
