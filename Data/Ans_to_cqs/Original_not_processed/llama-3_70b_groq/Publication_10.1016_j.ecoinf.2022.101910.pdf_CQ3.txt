Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning and convolutional neural networks for handling big datasets in bioacoustics, particularly in the context of bird species identification. It mentions BirdNET, a research project that facilitates automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, but does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used in its pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
