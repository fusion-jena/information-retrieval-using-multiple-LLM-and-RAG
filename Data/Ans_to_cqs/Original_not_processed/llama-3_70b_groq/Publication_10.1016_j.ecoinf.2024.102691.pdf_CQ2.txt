Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically RGB images and depth images. The input images are scaled down to a fixed size of 512 Ã— 512 and normalized using self-adaptive image scaling. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline. The focus is on image processing and object detection using YOLOv5 architecture.
