Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, but does not specify the data formats used. 

However, it does provide information on the occurrence data used for distribution modelling, which includes visual data (84%), satellite tracking data (13%), and acoustic recordings (11%). It also mentions that some studies used a combination of different data types. 

But, it does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, such as image, audio, video, CSV, etc. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
