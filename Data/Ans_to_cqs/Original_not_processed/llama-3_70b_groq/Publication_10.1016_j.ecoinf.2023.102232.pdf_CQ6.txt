Answer: 

The provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a hybrid algorithm that combines the Least Squares (LS) method with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation in an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system. It describes the steps involved in the LS algorithm, the genetic algorithm, and the computing tools used, but it does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
