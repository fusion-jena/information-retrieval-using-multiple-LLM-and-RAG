Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses the literature search strategy, screening process, and meta-data coding, but it does not provide information about a data repository. The mention of deep learning strategies is only a brief mention in the context of a shift towards machine learning methodologies, but it does not provide any information about a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
