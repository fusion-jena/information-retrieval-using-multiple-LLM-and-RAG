Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses various research studies and models used in built environment research, including HRNet and XGBoost, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
