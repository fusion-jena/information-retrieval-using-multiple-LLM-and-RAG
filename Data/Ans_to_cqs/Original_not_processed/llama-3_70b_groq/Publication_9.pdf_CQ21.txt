Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training procedure, dataset construction, and the Sashimi online model repository. It discusses the importance of iterative model training, the need for high-quality mask annotations, and the evaluation of model performance. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
