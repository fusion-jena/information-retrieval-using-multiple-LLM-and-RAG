Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used in environmental sound classification (Salamon et al., 2016). Data augmentation can be used to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data.

Additionally, the context mentions citizen science and data quality assessment (Kosmala et al., 2016; Swanson et al., 2016), which can be related to diverse data collection. However, it does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique that can be inferred as being used to address data bias is data augmentation. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned.
