Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This is mentioned in the context as "the validation of the model using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach show an RMSE of 13.93 ton/ha, an R2 of 0.88, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 10.77 and a bias of 0.28." This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated by iteratively training the model on all samples except one, and then testing it on the left-out sample, to assess its performance and robustness.
