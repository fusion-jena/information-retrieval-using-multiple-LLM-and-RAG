Answer:::
Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Optimizer: SGD (stochastic gradient descent)
* Initial learning rate: 0.01 for all models except MnasNet, which was initially set at 0.1
* Learning rate reduction: reduced by a factor of 10 after 30 epochs
* Batch normalization: used
* Number of epochs: 150
* GPUs: Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs were used for training.
