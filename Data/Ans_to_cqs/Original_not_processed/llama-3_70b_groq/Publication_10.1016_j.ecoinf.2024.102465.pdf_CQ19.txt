Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). However, it does mention the use of HRNet, LSTM-CNN, and PyCharm software. HRNet is a deep learning model architecture, LSTM-CNN is a type of neural network architecture, and PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports various programming languages, including Python, which is commonly used for deep learning. 

It can be inferred that the model might be built using Python, but the specific framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact framework used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
