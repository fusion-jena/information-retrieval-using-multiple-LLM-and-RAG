Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models for predicting soil classes and spatial sampling, with discussions on covariance-weighted bagging, model validation, and simulation techniques. 

However, it can be inferred that the context assumes a certain level of data preparation and preprocessing, as it involves working with environmental variables, response functions, and spatial autocorrelation information. 

In general, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature selection, and data transformation. However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
