Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, conservation biology, and marine citizen science, with references to various research papers and tools such as Bio-ORACLE, biomod2, and GIS analysis. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
