Answer: 

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors divided their data into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). This split allows the models to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, enabling the assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset in the provided context.
