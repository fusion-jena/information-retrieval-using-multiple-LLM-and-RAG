Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, a portable spectrometer is mentioned in the paper by Wang et al. (2023) for rapid classification of the freshness grades of sea bass, salmon, tuna, and beef. Additionally, spectral handheld devices are mentioned in the paper by Moser et al. (2023) for freshness assessment of carp and trout fillets. Furthermore, a portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor is mentioned in the paper by Kunjulakshmi et al. (2020) for Indian Mackerel stored under ice.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in other contexts, but based on the provided context, sensors appear to be the primary method for collecting raw data.
