Answer:::

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing thematic map evaluation and sampling methods in machine learning, specifically in the context of assessing the accuracy of a statistical prediction method.

The context mentions random sampling methods, such as simple random sampling and systematic random sampling, but it does not discuss deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
