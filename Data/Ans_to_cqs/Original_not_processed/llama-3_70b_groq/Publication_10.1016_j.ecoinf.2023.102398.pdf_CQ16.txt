Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the authors have adopted a graded MSE convergence approach (mentioned in the text) to fine-tune the model. This suggests that the training process is monitored and stopped when the model's performance on the training set converges or reaches a plateau, as indicated by the MSE (Mean Squared Error) metric. 

Additionally, the authors have provided various plots, such as the F1 curve, P curve, PR curve, and R curve, which may be used to visualize the model's performance during training and determine when it has converged. However, the specific criteria or threshold values used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
