Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses model evaluation, different engines, and references various papers on species distribution models, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.

The context does mention "Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent" in the reference to Friedman et al. (2010), which is a method for optimizing model parameters, but it does not specifically address hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
