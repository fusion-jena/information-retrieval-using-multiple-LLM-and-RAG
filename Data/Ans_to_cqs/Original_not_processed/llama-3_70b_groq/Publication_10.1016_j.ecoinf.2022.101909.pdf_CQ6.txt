Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that the implemented architecture receives RGB images of 224×224×3 as inputs, which are color spectrograms of two-second durations. It does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
