Answer::: 

The provided context mentions a few hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions the learning decay rate, which is set to 0.7, indicating that the learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses. However, the exact learning rate is not specified. Additionally, the context mentions the regularization strength, which is adjusted to explore its influence on the experimental results. The optimal regularization strength is found to be 0.2. 

The context does not mention the optimizer used in the model. It also does not provide information about other hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, or the activation functions used.
