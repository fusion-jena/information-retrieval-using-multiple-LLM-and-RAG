Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset of tree species, as the context mentions a list of 19 different tree species used in the classification task. Additionally, the model was tested on different spatial scales (30m, smaller scales), which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on varying datasets.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or ensemble methods. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping and the comparison of different deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, AlexNet) rather than the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
