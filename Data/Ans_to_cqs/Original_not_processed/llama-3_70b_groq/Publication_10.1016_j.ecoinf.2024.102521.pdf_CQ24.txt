Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological research, particularly in arthropod detection and monitoring. It discusses the use of deep learning for image processing, object detection, and classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
