Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to machine learning, spatial sampling, and soil science, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The references cited are academic papers and books, but they do not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
