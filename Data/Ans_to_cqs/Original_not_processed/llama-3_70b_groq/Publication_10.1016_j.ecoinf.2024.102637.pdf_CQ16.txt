Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and optimization techniques used in the model, including the use of structural re-parameterization, convolutional layers, and dropout technology. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
