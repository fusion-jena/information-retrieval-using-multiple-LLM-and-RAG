Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss the importance of separating training and test data beforehand to prevent bias and overfitting. It also recommends using spatial cross-validation techniques to bolster model robustness, which involves randomly selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing.

Additionally, the context mentions that the approach of separating training and test data beforehand can introduce bias, particularly when dealing with data that contains many zero values. This suggests that the criteria for splitting the data may depend on the specific characteristics of the data, such as the presence of zero values.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data, such as a specific ratio for train, test, and validation sets. Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this query based on the provided context.
