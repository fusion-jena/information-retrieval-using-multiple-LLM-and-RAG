Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). 

Accuracy is used to evaluate the classification performance of the models, with the highest accuracy of 98.2% Â± 0.85 SD achieved by BirdNET at 0 m. The accuracy of the models decreases as the distance increases.

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is used to evaluate the clustering performance of the models, specifically for affinity propagation clustering and HDBSCAN. The NMI values are plotted as a function of distance for the five feature types.

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context.
