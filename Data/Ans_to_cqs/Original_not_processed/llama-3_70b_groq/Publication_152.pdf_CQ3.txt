Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on various research papers and articles related to deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their applications in image processing, particularly with UAV-collected images. It discusses topics like image feature learning, data augmentation, and semantic segmentation, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
