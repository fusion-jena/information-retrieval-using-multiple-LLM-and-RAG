Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or methods for collecting raw data. The context appears to be discussing data repositories, citation management, and data stewardship in the context of environmental science projects. It mentions specific projects such as AmeriFlux, NGEE-Tropics, and WFSFA, but does not provide information on how raw data is collected for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
