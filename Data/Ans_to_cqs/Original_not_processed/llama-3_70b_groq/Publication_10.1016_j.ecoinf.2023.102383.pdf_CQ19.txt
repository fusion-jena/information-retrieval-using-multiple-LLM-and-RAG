Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses various concepts related to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual neural networks (ResNets), and feature pyramid networks (FPNs), but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
