Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the naive approach of randomly sampling images from the full data set may lead to information leakage between the data sets due to images being captured in close proximity and potentially having overlapping fields of views. This implies that the authors are aware of the potential issue of data bias.

The context also mentions that another approach would be to split the collected data (although it does not specify how), which suggests that the authors may have used a technique to address data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

The only data augmentation technique mentioned in the context is a three-step procedure applied to the images during training, which includes randomly flipping images horizontally, scaling the contrast of each image channel, and randomly cropping the image. This technique is used to increase the diversity of the training data, but it is not specifically mentioned as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
