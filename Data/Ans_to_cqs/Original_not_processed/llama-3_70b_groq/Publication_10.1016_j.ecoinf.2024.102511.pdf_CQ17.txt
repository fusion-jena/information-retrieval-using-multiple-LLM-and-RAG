Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of machine learning and deep neural networks in bioacoustic classification, but it does not delve into the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
