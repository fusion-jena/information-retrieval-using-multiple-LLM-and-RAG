Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The hyperparameters listed in Table 2 include learning rate, batch size, and epochs, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
