Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on evaluating the DEPP model on simulated data sets, discussing its performance, and comparing it with other models. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not discussed in the given context.
