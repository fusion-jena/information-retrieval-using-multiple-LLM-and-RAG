Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references related to machine learning, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about a specific dataset or repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
