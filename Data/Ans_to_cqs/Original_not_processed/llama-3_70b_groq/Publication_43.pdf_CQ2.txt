Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image classification tasks, particularly in the realm of remote sensing. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. The images are likely in a format such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF, but the specific format is not mentioned.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information about the data formats used, but based on the discussion of CNNs and image classification tasks, it is reasonable to assume that images are the primary data format used in this pipeline.
