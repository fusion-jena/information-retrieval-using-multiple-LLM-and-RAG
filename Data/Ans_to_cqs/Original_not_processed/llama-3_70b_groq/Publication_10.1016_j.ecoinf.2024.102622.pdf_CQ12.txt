Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions various machine learning models such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR), but it does not specify a deep learning model. Additionally, the context discusses the use of attention mechanism and dynamic convolution in a rice disease identification network, but it does not provide enough information to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
