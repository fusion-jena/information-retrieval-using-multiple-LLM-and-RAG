Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to remote sensing and satellite data, specifically Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data. There is no explicit mention of specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. However, it can be inferred that the data formats might be related to raster or spatial data formats, such as GeoTIFF or HDF, which are commonly used in remote sensing applications.
