Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated using the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)) of the optimized models. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated for reference. 

It is also mentioned that the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models, and the RMSE for each observation site was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site. 

However, the specific strategy or metric used to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned.
