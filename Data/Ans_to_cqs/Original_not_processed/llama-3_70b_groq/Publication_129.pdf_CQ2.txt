Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. There are several references to image processing, computer vision, and image recognition in the context. For example, papers [18], [19], [20], and [26] mention the use of deep learning for image analysis, object detection, and classification in the context of agricultural pest detection and crop monitoring.

Specifically, the data formats mentioned in the context include:

* X-ray scans (mentioned in paper [25])
* UAV images (mentioned in paper [26])
* Near-infrared images (mentioned in paper [18])

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, and it's possible that other data formats may be used in addition to images. However, based on the available information, it appears that image data is the primary focus of the pipeline.
