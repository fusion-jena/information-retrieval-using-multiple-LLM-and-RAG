Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the object detection model, the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, and the classification and regression branches. It also provides references to various studies and papers related to deep learning and agricultural pest recognition.

However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to address data bias using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help mitigate issues like class imbalance, overfitting, and underfitting.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution. Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenario.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing techniques used, it is unclear which techniques were employed to address data bias in this particular pipeline.
