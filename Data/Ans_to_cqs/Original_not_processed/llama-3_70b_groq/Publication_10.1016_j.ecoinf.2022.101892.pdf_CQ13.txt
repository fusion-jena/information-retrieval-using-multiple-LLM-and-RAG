Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context focuses on the experimental setup, model architecture, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
