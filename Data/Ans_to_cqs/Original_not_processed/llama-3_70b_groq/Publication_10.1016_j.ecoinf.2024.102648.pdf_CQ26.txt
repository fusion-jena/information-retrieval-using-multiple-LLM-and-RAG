Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on explaining various machine learning models and techniques, such as boosted trees, early stopping, and neural networks, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
