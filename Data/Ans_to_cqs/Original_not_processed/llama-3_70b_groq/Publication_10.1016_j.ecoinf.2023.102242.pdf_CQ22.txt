Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the object-oriented classification models (not specifically deep learning models) are:

1. Producer accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances for each class.
2. User accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances for each class, but from the user's perspective.
3. Overall accuracy: This metric measures the overall proportion of correctly classified instances across all classes.
4. Kappa: This metric measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of chance agreement.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of both nearest neighbor classification and random forest classification models in 2020 and 2021. However, there is no mention of precision, recall, or other metrics commonly used to evaluate deep learning models.
