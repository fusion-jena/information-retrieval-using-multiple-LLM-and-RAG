Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, including GF-1 multispectral images, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. These data formats are likely to be image-based, such as TIFF or GeoTIFF, given the nature of remote sensing data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of LightGBM, a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, which typically operates on numerical data. However, it is unclear whether this algorithm is part of a deep learning pipeline or used for a different purpose. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
