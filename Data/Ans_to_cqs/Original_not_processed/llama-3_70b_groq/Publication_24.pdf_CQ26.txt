Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for urban ecoacoustic assessment, preprocessing of spectrograms, and normalisation strategies. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine if techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias.
