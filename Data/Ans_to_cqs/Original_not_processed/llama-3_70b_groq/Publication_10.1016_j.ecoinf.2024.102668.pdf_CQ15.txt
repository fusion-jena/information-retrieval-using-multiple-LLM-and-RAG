Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on audio signal processing, ecological monitoring, and the application of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) in machine learning and deep learning. While it mentions the potential extension of EAI to fields like machine learning and deep learning, it does not provide details on the specific optimization techniques used in these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
