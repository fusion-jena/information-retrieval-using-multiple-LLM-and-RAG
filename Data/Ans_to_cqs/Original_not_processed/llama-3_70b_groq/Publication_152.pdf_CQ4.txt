Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "small changes in brightness and zoom can help to improve significantly" and that "medium or large changes in zoom range also caused degradation of results." This suggests that zooming and brightness adjustments were used as data augmentation techniques.

Additionally, the context references a paper titled "Ricap: Random image cropping and patching data augmentation for deep cnns" [26], which implies that random image cropping and patching were also used as data augmentation techniques.

It does not mention flipping or rotating as data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I can only confirm that zooming, brightness adjustments, random image cropping, and patching were used, but I don't know about flipping or rotating.
