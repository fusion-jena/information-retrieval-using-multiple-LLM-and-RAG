Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of Faster R-CNN. This is mentioned in the context where it is stated that "Due to the large image size and additional parameters of Faster R-CNN, a minibatch size of four images per GPU (TITAN Xp) was selected for training the model."
