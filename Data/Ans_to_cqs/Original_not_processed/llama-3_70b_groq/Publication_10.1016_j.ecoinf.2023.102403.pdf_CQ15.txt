Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, SGD, or Adam. The context appears to be related to biodiversity data collection, data repositories, and data filtering, with references to scientific papers and R packages. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so it is not possible to determine what optimization techniques are applied in a deep learning pipeline.
