Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the selection of the batch size, optimizer, and learning ratio, but it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
