Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the structure of VAE, reparameterization trick, and various deep learning models such as EfficientNet, CNN, and LSTM, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions "stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on BP" in the description of the VAE structure, which suggests that SGD might be used as an optimization technique in some part of the pipeline. But it does not provide information about other optimization techniques that might be used.

Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and I do not know the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline beyond the mention of SGD.
