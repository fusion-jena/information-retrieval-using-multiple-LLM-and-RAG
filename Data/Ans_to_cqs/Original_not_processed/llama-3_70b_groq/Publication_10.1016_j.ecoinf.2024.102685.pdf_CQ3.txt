Answer: 

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of Random Forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats using multispectral images. It discusses the effectiveness of Random Forest in handling small or noisy datasets and its ability to improve classification accuracy when considering mixed habitats or using satellite images with coarse spatial resolution. 

There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given information.
