Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Number of neural network layers (integer, tuning range: 1-5)
* Number of neurons per layer (integer, tuning range: 64, 128, 256, 512, 2048)
* Dropout (float, tuning range: 0.1, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5)
* Learning rate (float, tuning range: 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001)
* Batch size (integer, tuning range: 32, 64, 128, 256)

Note that the optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that is often associated with the optimizer.
