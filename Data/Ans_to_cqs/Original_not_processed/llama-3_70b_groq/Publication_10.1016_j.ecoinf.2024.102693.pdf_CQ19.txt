Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The context focuses on the architecture and performance of various models, including ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7, but does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
