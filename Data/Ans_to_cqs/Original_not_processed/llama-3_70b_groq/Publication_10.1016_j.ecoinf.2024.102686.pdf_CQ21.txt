Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data sources, preprocessing, and clustering methods used in the Human Activity (HA)â€“Natural Endowment (NE) coupled zoning index system. It discusses the use of SVM and SOM networks, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
