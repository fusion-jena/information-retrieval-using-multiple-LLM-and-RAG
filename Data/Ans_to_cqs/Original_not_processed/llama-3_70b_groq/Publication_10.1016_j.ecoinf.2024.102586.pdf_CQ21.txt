Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only mentions that the random forest (RF) model was employed to examine the relative importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on the invasive plant species richness and abundance separately. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that were performed after training the model.
