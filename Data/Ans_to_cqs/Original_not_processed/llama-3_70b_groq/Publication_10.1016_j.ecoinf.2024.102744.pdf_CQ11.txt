Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing a deep learning model for pollen-bearing bee detection, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. If the link is not explicitly mentioned in the context, I cannot provide an answer.
