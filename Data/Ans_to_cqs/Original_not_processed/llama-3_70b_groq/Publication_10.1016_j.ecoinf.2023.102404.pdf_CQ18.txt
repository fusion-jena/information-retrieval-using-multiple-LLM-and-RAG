Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. According to the context, "The grid search then exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and evaluated the model's performance using cross-validation techniques." This indicates that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters during the grid search process. Additionally, the context mentions that the goal was to minimize the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to achieve the most accurate predictions, which further supports the use of cross-validation as a strategy to monitor model performance during training.
