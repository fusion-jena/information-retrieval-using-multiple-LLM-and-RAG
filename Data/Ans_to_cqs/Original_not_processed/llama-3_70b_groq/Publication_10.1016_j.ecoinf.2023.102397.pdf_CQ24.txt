Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and automated biodiversity monitoring using machine learning models like random forests.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random forests, which is a machine learning model that inherently involves randomness in its decision-making process. The model is based on decision trees, and the randomness comes from the random selection of features at each node of the tree (Breiman, 2001). 

Despite this, there is no mention of strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided information.
