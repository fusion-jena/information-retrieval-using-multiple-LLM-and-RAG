Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a practice-oriented approach to validate their model's performance. They split their data on the sticky plate level, keeping individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This allowed them to validate their model's performance by emulating the way it would be used in practice, predicting a class for any given object it detected on unseen sticky plate images.

It can be inferred that the authors used this approach to monitor the model's performance during training, but the exact strategy or metrics used to evaluate the model's performance are not mentioned.
