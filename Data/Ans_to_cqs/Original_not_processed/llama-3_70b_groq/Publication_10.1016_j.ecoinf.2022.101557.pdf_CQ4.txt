Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. In fact, the text mentions that even generative methods require some annotated data to get started, and it is uncertain if artifacts from the generative process will be kept in the generated data and how these artifacts will be expressed. This suggests that data augmentation techniques may not be explicitly applied in this pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline.
