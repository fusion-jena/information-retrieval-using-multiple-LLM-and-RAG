Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions the use of DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is a semantic segmentation model designed for image data. Additionally, the text mentions the use of RGB color images and the possibility of including a NIR (Near-Infrared) band in addition to the RGB bands, which further supports the idea that image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data is the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information about the specific image data format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF), but it is clear that image data is being used.
