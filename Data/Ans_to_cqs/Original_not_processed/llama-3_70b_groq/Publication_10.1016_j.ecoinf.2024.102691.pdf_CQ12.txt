Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLOv5, which is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of object detection models. YOLOv5 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of a VGG16 model, which is another type of CNN architecture. There is also a mention of the Swin Transformer, which is a type of vision transformer model. However, it is not clear if the Swin Transformer is used in the pipeline or just mentioned as a reference.
