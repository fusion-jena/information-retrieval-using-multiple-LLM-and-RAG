Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model optimization process, including the tuning of hyperparameters, and the architecture of the MLP model. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
