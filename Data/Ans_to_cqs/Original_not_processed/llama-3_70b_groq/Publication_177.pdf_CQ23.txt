Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the models were fine-tuned on two different datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200, which might have helped in improving their generalizability. Additionally, the use of Bayesian optimization to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model might have also contributed to their generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of diverse datasets to ensure generalizability. The context only mentions that the models were trained on the datasets and their performance was evaluated using various metrics. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the models were explicitly designed to ensure generalizability.
