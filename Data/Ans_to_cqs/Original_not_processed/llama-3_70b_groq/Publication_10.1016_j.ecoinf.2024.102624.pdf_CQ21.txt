Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that accuracy assessment is one of the post-processing steps. 

In the context, it is mentioned that two types of accuracy assessments were applied. The first type is 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions, which helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA). This step also provides the distribution of 30 OAs, including minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. The second type of accuracy assessment involves predicting the classes of the testing dataset.

Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that metrics calculation might be involved in the accuracy assessment step, as the overall accuracy (OA) is calculated. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as post-processing steps.
