Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, including the selection of the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs, as well as techniques to avoid overfitting. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
