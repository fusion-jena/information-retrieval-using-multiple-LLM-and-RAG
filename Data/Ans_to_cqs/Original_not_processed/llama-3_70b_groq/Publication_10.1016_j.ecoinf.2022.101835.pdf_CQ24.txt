Answer: 

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. 

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and dropout. By setting a fixed random seed, the randomness is controlled, and the results can be reproduced.

In the context provided, it is not mentioned whether a random seed value was set or not. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether any strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
