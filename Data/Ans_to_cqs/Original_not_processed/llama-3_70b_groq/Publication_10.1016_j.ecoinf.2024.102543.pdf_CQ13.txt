Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, performance evaluation metrics, and the dataset used for training and testing. It discusses the addition of the P2 feature level to the YOLOv8 architecture, the importance of the C2f layer, and the proposed modification to make it lighter. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
