Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is evident from the mention of YOLOv5, which is a popular object detection algorithm. Additionally, the context mentions "detection model" and "apple detection method" in the references, further supporting the idea that the model is used for object detection.
