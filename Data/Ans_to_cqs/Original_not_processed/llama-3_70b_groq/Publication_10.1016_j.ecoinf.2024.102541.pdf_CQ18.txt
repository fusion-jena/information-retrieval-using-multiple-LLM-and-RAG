Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and optimization techniques used in the YOLOv5 model, such as the use of EIoU loss, Stem Block, Mobile Bottleneck Block, depth-wise separable convolutions, and BiFPN. It also provides performance metrics like mAP, GFLOPs, and FPS, but it does not discuss the strategy for monitoring model performance during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
