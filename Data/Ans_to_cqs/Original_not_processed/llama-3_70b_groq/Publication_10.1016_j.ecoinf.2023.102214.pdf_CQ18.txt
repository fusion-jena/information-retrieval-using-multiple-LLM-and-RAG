Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to inspect the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This is done by tuning the number of required epochs and assessing the model's performance on held-out test data. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of interest, resulting in overfitting. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated by computing the top-k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches. This helps to identify if the model is memorizing its training set rather than learning a generalized matching strategy.
