Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and human-wildlife conflicts, and it discusses various machine learning models and their evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
