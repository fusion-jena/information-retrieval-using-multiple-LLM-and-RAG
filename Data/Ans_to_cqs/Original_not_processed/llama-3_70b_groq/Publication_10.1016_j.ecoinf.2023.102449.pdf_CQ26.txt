Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. This is mentioned in the text as "we demonstrate how a simple linear transformation can be used to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation under our approach."

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing in this specific deep learning pipeline.
