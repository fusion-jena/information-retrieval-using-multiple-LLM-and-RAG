Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and tested on different datasets to simulate real-world scenarios. The context mentions three source-target pairs (GH!LH, GH!LL, and LL!LH) used for between-dataset prediction, which suggests that the model was tested on different datasets to evaluate its performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CNN model was trained with N images randomly selected from the source dataset, which could be interpreted as a form of random sampling. However, it is not clear if this was done to ensure generalizability or for some other purpose.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the evaluation of the model on different datasets, it does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
