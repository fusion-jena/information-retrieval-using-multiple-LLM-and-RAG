Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that 10% of the data was used as a validation set to check for overfitting during the training process. This suggests that some form of validation was performed to ensure the model's performance on unseen data, but the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability are not specified.
