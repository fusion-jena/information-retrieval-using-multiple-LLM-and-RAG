Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses optimizing aspects of the particle filter, such as reducing computational cost by using alternative resampling methods, and tuning grid and block sizes for parallel processing. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
