Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of GPUs and parallel computing in various applications, including machine learning and ecology.

However, it does mention some deep learning frameworks and tools, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which are known to support various optimization techniques. These frameworks often provide built-in support for popular optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adam, RMSProp, and others.

While the context does not explicitly mention these optimization techniques, it can be inferred that they might be used in conjunction with the mentioned deep learning frameworks and tools. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it suggests that optimization techniques like SGD and Adam might be used in deep learning pipelines, especially when working with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
