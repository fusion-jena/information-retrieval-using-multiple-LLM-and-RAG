Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing data sets alone. Instead, the performance must also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples. This suggests that the model performance is evaluated using both training and testing data sets, as well as real-world examples, to get a more comprehensive understanding of its performance.
