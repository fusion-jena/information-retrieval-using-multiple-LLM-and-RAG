Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention "new computational power accessible through latest GPU" in the section 2.2 Deep Learning, which suggests that GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are likely used for training the model. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) or any other specific hardware resources.
