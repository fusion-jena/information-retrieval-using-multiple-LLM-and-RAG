Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be from a research paper or article discussing energy consumption and ecological informatics in Xi'an, China. It provides information on the study area, data sources, and a formula for calculating CO2 emissions, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
