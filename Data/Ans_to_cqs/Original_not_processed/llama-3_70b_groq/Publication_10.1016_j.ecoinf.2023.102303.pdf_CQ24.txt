Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on gradient boosting, XGBoost, and deep learning methodologies applied to various applications, including underwater fish video processing techniques. It discusses the development of novel deep learning networks using semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised models to achieve high accuracy with short turnaround times. However, it does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
