Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the study are primarily raster and vector formats. Specifically, the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data is in a raster format with a 10m spatial resolution, and the weather data is also in a raster format with a 2.5 km spatial resolution. Additionally, the study uses vector data formats for the database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD), Geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ), and Geobase Adresses Quebec.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the study. It is also unclear if CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are used, as the context does not provide explicit information about the data storage or processing formats.

In summary, the data formats used in the study are primarily raster and vector formats, but the context does not provide information about the use of image, audio, video, or CSV files.
