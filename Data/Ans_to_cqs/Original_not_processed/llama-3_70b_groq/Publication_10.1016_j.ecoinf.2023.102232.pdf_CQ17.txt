Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to describe a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines a least squares (LS) method with a genetic algorithm (GA) and a Metropolis-Hastings-like macro step for parameter estimation. There is no mention of deep learning, dropout, or L2 regularization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
