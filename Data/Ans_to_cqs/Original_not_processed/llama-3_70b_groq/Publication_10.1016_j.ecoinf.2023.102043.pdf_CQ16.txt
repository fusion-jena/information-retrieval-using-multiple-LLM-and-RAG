Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typical concepts in machine learning. The context appears to be related to a recording campaign for goat vocalizations, with discussions about REC events, audio files, annotations, and durations. There is no mention of training or model evaluation, which makes it impossible to determine the criteria for completing training.
