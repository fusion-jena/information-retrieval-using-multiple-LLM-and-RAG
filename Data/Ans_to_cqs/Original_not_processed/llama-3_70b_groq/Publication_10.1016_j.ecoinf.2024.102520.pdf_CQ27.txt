Answer:::

I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, soil science, and land use, with references to academic papers and discussions about land use maps, soil maps, and spatial datasets. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
