Answer:::
Answer: The pipeline uses a hybrid deep learning model, specifically a CA-Hybrid network, which combines CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and ViT (Vision Transformer) modules. This is mentioned in the context as "CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervidae localized by YOLOv7."
