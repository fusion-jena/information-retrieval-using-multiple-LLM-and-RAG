Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data. It discusses the use of supervised classification systems, training datasets, and four machine learning algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF) for LULC classification.

However, it is mentioned that the predictor variables were "equally centered and scaled" to reduce sampling bias. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing was performed to mitigate bias, but the specific techniques used are not elaborated upon.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
