Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used for wetland mapping, which involves classifying remote sensing images into different wetland classes such as Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, Shallow water, Urban, Deep water, and Upland. The model is trained to predict the class label of a given image, and the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Kappa index, Average accuracy, and Overall accuracy. The model is also compared with other deep learning models such as Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and CNN, which suggests that the purpose is classification.
