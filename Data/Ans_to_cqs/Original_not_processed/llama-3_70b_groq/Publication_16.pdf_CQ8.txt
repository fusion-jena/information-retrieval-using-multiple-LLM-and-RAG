Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the website "www.conservationai.co.uk" which is a public-facing website developed by the authors, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I don't know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
