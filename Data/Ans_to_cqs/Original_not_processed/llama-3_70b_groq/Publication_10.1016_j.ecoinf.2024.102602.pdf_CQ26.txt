Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on model selection, parametrization, and optimization for a classification task, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors may have used some techniques to address data bias, but it is not mentioned in the given text.
