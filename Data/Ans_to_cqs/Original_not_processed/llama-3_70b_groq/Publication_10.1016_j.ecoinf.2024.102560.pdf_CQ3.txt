Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, discussing topics like soil erosion, lake drying, and drought monitoring using remote sensing datasets and techniques like Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Differential Symbolic Entropy (DSE). There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.
