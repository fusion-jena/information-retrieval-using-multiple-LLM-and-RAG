Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing species identification and population size estimation using machine learning and Bayesian methods, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected. It mentions the use of R-code and .csv files, but it does not specify the source of the data or how it was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
