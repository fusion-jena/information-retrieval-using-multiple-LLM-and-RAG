Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different deep learning models, including the proposed EMViT-Net, and the architecture of EMViT-Net. It discusses data augmentation and normalization as preprocessing steps to address data diversity and imbalance problems, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
