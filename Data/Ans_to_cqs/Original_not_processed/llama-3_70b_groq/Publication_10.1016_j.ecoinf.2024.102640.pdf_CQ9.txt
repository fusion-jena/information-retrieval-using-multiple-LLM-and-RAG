Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the lack of high-quality datasets for GVI extraction, introduces the SegFormer model for semantic segmentation, and proposes a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) for GVI learning. However, it does not provide information about where the dataset or the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
