Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in deep learning, such as random seed values. The context primarily discusses a hierarchical classification model using a Random Forest classifier for plant species identification, with a focus on data collection, sampling, and evaluation strategies. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or randomness handling strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
