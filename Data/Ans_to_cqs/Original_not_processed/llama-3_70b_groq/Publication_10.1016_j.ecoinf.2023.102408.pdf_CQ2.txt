Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from remote sensing. This is inferred from the mention of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, which are satellite imagery datasets. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used. Additionally, the context mentions various approaches such as vegetation indices, texture analysis, and transformed data, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT), and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, which are commonly used in image processing and analysis. There is no mention of CSV data format being used in the pipeline.
