Answer:::
The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only describes the overall pipeline of STARdbi, which includes sampling flying insects with sticky traps, scanning the traps, uploading the images and metadata to the database, and automatic detection of insects in the images. It does not provide details on any data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
