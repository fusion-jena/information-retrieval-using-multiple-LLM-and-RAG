Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to atmospheric correction in aquatic environments, discussing various algorithms and models used for this purpose, as well as the use of satellite images and specific sensors. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
