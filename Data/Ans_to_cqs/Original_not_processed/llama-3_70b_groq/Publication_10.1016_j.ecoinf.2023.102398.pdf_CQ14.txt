Answer: The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it is mentioned in Table 2 that "The hyper parameters are based on the optimized values for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch." This suggests that the hyperparameters are optimized based on the values used for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch, but the exact method of optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
