Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a framework for assessing ecological carbon sink risk zones using a matrix that aligns carbon sink priorities with landscape risks, and mentions the use of MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) methods. 

However, the context does mention the importance of cross-validation in assessing the generalizability and robustness of ecological zoning models. It suggests that future studies could focus on using statistical and machine learning techniques to model the relationship between landscape features and ecological carbon sink capabilities, and implement cross-validation techniques to assess the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that cross-validation is recognized as an important technique for ensuring the generalizability of models, but it is not clear if it was actually used in the study.
