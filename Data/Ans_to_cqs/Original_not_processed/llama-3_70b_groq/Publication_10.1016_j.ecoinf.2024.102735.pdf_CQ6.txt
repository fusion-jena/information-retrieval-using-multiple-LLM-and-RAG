Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology adopted for developing machine-learning models to estimate the effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions. It discusses data acquisition, the use of different machine learning models, and the impact of dataset size and tree depth on model performance. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
