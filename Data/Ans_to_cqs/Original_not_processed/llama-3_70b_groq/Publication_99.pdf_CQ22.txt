Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study are Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate the generative models, specifically the reconstruction models. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
