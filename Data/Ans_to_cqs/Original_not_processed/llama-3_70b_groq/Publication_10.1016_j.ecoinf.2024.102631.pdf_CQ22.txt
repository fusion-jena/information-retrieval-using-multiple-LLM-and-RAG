Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. These metrics are used for non-reference evaluation, meaning they do not require a reference image to compare the results with. 

UIQM (Universal Image Quality Index) and UCIQE (Universal Image Quality Evaluation) are metrics that measure the quality of the output image. A higher score in either UIQM or UCIQE indicates an enhanced level of human visual perception in the results.

NIQE (Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator) is a metric that measures the naturalness of the output image. A lower NIQE score indicates a better perception quality.

Additionally, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) are also mentioned as metrics used for evaluation, but they are used for reference-based evaluation, meaning they require a reference image to compare the results with.
