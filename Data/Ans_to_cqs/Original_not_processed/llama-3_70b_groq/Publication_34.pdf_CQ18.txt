Answer::: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the calculation of evaluation metrics, such as the mean loss, on the train set (4781 sites) during the training process. The mean loss is the objective function that is minimized during model training, and it is relevant to the ecological model. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the performance metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set and a test set. This suggests that the model performance is evaluated on the train set during training, and the test set is used to test the model's generalization capacities. However, the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated.
