Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to hydrology, soil science, and natural water retention measures, discussing topics such as infiltration capacity, land use conversion, and flood prevention. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning concepts, including regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
