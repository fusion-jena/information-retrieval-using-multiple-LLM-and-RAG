Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline uses image data as input. This is evident from the fact that the system processes image data and uses a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for efficient processing. 

Additionally, the output of the pipeline is provided in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, which is a common format for tabular data. This is mentioned in section A.1.4, where the output template is described, and Table A.1 shows an example of the output data in CSV format.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image (as input) and CSV (as output).
