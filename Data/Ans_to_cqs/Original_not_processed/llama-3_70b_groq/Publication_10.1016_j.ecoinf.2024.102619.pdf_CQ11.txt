Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that commercial restrictions apply to the availability of the data used in this work, but it does not provide a link to a public repository where the data or pipeline can be accessed. It does provide links to documentation for PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch, but these are not related to the data repository link requested.
