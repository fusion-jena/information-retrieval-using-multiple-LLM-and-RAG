Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the decision to train the model from scratch, the architecture of the CNN, the choice of activation functions, optimizer, and hyperparameters, as well as the training process. It does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
