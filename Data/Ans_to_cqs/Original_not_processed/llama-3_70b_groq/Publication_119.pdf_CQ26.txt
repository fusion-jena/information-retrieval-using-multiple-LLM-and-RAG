Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and hyperparameter tuning of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model and the U-Net model, as well as their performance evaluation.

However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used techniques to address data bias, as they mention that the quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited. This limitation might have led them to use techniques such as data augmentation or diverse data collection to mitigate data bias.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide explicit information on the techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to answer the query, and it is unclear what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
