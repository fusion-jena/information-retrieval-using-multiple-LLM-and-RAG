Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning strategies were used, citing Cazau et al. (2023) as an example, but it does not provide further details about the specific model architecture. The context does provide a list of specific models implemented in the reviewed literature, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), but it does not specify whether these are part of a larger pipeline or what type of deep learning model is used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
