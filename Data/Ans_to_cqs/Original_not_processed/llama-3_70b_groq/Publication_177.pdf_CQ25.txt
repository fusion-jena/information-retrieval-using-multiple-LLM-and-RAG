Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The models are used to identify plant species from images. The models are trained on datasets of images of different plant species, and their performance is evaluated based on their ability to correctly classify new, unseen images into their respective species. The models are fine-tuned to optimize their hyperparameters, and their performance is compared across different models and datasets. The goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in identifying plant species from images.
