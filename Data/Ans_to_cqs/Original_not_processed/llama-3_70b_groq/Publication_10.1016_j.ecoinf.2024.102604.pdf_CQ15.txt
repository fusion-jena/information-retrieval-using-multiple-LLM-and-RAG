Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and bias correction methods, including geographic filtering, aggregation background, and similarity background methods. It also mentions machine learning methods like Random Forests, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maximum Entropy, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
