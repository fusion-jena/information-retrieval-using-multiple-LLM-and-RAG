Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context discusses the LSTM model, its prediction process, and its comparison with other models, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
