Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Camera traps are widely used in wildlife surveys because they are non-invasive, low-cost, and highly efficient. They are deployed in the wild and often produce large datasets. The context mentions that camera traps deployed in the wild often produce large datasets, making it increasingly difficult to manually classify images.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention that the study explores an adaptive deep learning method to use small-scale training sets and a commonly-available desktop personal computer (PC) to achieve automatic filtering of empty camera images.

It is possible that other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets may be used in other deep learning pipelines, but based on the provided context, camera traps are the primary method used for collecting raw data.
