Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the PTDLEN-VAE model, its experimental results, and the IKHO algorithm used for parameter optimization. It does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
