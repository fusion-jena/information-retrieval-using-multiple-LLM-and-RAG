Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and articles related to deep learning, computer vision, and ecology. While it discusses various deep learning models and architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and YOLO, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is an important step in deep learning pipelines, and it typically involves applying transformations to the training data to increase its size and diversity. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. However, without specific information on the pipeline in question, it is not possible to determine which data augmentation techniques are being applied.
