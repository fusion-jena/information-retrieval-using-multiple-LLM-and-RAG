Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context only mentions that the results from CA, TSA, and Machine Learning models' prediction are displayed in Section 3 and discussed in Section 4, but it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
