Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as ecosystem service change, land degradation, soil properties, and vegetation degradation, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
