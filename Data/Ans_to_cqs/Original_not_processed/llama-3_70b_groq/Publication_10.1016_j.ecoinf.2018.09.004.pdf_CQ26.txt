Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention stratified cross-validation as a method used to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing data bias, but the specific techniques used to do so are not discussed.

The context does highlight the issue of data imbalance, where one class (Cymodocea) constitutes 75% of the dataset, and notes that accuracy may not be a suitable measure due to this imbalance. This implies that the authors are aware of the need to address data bias, but the specific techniques used to do so are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context, as it is not mentioned.
