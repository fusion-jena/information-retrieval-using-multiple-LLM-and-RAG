Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the implementation and training of the CNN using Keras and TensorFlow, the use of transfer learning, and the pre-trained weights from EfficientNet-B4. It does not provide information about the optimization algorithms used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
