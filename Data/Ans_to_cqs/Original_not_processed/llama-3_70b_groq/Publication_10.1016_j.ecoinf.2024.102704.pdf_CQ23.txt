Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the targeted fish species dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This suggests that the authors used a form of data splitting to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide information on whether they used cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure generalizability.
