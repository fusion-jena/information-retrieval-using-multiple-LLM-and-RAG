Answer: 

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the clustering approach used to determine the freshness classes of fish, the evaluation of the clustering results, and the consideration of Euclidean distance as a metric in the clustering process. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
