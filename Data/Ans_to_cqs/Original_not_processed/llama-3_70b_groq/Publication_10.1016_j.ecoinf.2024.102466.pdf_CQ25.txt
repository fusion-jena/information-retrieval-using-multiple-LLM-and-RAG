Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is object detection, specifically bird detection in camera trap images. The authors employed eight deep learning algorithms to detect wild birds in images acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The goal is to efficiently detect birds in camera trap images, reducing manual processing costs and enabling more efficient monitoring of wildlife populations over wide areas and time.
