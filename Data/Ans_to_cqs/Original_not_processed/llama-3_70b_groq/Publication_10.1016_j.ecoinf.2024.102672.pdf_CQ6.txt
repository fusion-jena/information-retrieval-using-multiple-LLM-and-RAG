Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and hyperparameters of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as well as the training process. It discusses the different types of hyperparameters, the initial hyperparameters space, and the optimization process, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
