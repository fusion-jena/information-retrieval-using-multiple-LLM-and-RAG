Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on contrastive loss, Siamese networks, and their applications in various domains, including computer vision and author identification. It also discusses the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in classification tasks, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
