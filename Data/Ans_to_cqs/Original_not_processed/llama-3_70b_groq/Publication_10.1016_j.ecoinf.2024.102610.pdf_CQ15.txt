Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning techniques or optimization methods such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily discusses machine learning approaches, specifically random forests, and feature elimination techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
