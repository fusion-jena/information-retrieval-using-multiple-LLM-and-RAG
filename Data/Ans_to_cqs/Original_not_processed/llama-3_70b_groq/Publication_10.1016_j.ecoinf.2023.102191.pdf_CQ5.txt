Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a citizen science project that involves crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app. The discussion focuses on the trade-offs between opportunistic reporting and systematic surveys in citizen science initiatives, and the use of a custom species list to collect data. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
