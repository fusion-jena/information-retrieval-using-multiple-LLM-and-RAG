Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the recommended parameters for all MLMs are used, except for Random Forest (RF), where the number of trees is set to 500 as an additional parameter. This suggests that the hyperparameters may not have been optimized through a method such as grid search or random search, but rather default or recommended values were used. However, without further information, it is unclear how the hyperparameters were optimized.
