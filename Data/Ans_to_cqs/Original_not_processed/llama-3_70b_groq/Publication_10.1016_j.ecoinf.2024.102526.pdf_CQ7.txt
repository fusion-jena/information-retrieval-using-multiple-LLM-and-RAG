Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a dataset or study involving underwater imagery, with details on the planned study design, spatial and temporal extent, image capture settings, and metadata. However, there is no mention of deep learning model training or the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. The context focuses on the data collection and annotation process, but does not provide information on the subsequent steps of machine learning model development. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
