Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different classifiers, feature extraction techniques, and the proposed framework for coral reef image classification. It discusses the use of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNN models for feature extraction, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
