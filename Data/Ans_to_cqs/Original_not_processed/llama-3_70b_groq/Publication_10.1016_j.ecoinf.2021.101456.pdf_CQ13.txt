Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Learning rate: 10^(-5)
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer
* Batch size: 256
* Number of epochs: 5000
* Decision to adapt β: every fifth epoch
* Scaling of the clustering loss, γ: cycled between 0.01 and 0.2 every 100 epochs

These hyperparameters were used to train the dynamic β-VAE model in PyTorch.
