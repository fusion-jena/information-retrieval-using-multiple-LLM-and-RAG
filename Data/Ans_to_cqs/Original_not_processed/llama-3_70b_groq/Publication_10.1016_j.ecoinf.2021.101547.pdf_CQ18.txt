Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It explains the process of training a deep learning model, including the use of mini-batches, epochs, and the impact of mini-batch size on the training process. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
