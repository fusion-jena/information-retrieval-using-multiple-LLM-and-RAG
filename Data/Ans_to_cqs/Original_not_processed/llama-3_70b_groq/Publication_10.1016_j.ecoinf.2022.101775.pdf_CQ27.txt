Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the use of stochastic gradient descent, batch size, and number of epochs, as well as the implementation in Pytorch and training in Google Colaboratory. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
