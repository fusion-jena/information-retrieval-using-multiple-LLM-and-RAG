Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The confusion matrix is explicitly mentioned in Figure 3, which shows the percentage of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative classification outcomes observed during the experiment. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of metrics, such as the percentage of false positive and false negative predictions (4.2% and 3.6%, respectively). This implies that some form of metrics calculation was performed after model training.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step. It is possible that saliency maps were not used in this particular experiment or study.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context appear to include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix, but not saliency maps.
