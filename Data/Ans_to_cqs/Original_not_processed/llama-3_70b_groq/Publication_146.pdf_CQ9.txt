Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the creation of a custom dataset for the project, but it does not provide information about where the dataset is stored or shared. The references cited are mostly arXiv papers, which do not typically include dataset repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the data repository.
