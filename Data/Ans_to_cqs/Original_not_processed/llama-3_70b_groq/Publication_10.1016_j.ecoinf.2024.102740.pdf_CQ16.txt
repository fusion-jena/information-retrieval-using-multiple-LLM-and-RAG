Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification, the software used (SAGA and QGIS), and the parameters tuned for RF (maximum tree depth and minimum sample number). It also discusses the importance of grassland management and the use of remote sensing technology, but it does not provide information on the criteria for determining when training is complete.
