Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the word2vec model. It only mentions the word2vec technique and its two architectures, Skip-gram and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), but does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these architectures. The context also mentions that a pre-trained baroni word2vec model was used for the semantic analysis, but it does not provide information about the framework used to build this model. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
