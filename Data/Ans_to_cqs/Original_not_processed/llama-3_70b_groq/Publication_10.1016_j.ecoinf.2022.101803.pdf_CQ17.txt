Answer: 

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used in deep learning. However, it does mention regularization in the context of parameter estimation with maximum likelihood (ML). 

According to the context, one form of regularization is ridge regression, where the model coefficients are shrunk towards smaller values by altering the ML criterion to include a penalty term based on the weighted L2 norm of the parameter vector. This is mentioned in equation (16).

The context does not mention dropout as a regularization method. It also does not provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that dropout or L2 regularization are used in the context provided.

In summary, the context only mentions ridge regression as a form of regularization in the context of parameter estimation with ML, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
