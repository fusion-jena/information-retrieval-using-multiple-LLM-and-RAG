Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the GoogLeNet model, the experiments conducted, and the results obtained. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
