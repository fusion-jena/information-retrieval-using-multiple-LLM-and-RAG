Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are related to metrics calculation and retrieval results. 

The context mentions that four performance measures, namely average retrieval precision (ARP), average retrieval rate (ARR), F-score, and mean average precision (mAP), are used to compare the retrieval performances. The mathematical formulations for these performance measures are provided, indicating that these metrics are calculated after model training.

Additionally, the context presents the retrieval results in tables, which suggests that the model's output is used to retrieve images from the database and calculate these performance metrics.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are primarily related to metrics calculation and retrieval results.
