Answer: The data repository link is not provided in the given context. The article mentions that "The data that has been used is confidential" and does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Additionally, the supplementary data is available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102481, but it does not seem to be a data repository link.
