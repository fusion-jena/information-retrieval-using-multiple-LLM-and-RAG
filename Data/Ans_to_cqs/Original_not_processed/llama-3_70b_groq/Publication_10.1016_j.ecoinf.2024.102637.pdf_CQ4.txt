Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly ResNet and AlexNet, for image and audio classification tasks. It discusses the importance of reducing model complexity and improving performance while maintaining a balance between speed and accuracy. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
