Answer::: 

The platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that Aksoy et al. (2022) utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to assess three different machine learning algorithms for mapping soil salinity. Although this does not directly answer the question about the deployment platform, it suggests that Google Earth Engine might be involved in the process. However, it is not clear if the deep learning model was deployed on GEE or another platform. Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this question based on the provided context.
