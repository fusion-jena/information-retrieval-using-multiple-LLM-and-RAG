Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANN) and its application in regression analysis, but it does not specify the regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.

However, it is mentioned that the optimal number of hidden layers of an ANN model depends on the problem itself, and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance. This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting, but they do not provide specific details on how it was addressed in their model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in this particular deep learning pipeline.
