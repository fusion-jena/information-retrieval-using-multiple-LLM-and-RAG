Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context only discusses the creation of training and testing datasets, the conversion of testing segments into spectrograms, and the generation of spectrogram images. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
