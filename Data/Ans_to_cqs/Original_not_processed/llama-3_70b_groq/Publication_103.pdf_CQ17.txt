Answer:::

Based on the provided context, I don't see any explicit mention of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can infer that batch normalization might be used as a regularization method, as it is mentioned in the context of "reducing internal covariate shift" (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). This can help prevent overfitting by normalizing the input data for each layer.

Other than batch normalization, I don't see any other regularization methods mentioned in the provided context, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot confirm if these specific methods are used in the deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context primarily focuses on convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and classification tasks, but it does not explicitly discuss regularization methods. If more context or information is provided, I might be able to give a more comprehensive answer.
