Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context discusses random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, and mentions that 25% of samples are used as testing data, which is a standard modeling practice. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets randomly
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set
* Time-based splitting: dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets based on time, such as using historical data for training and recent data for testing

However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context, and I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer.
