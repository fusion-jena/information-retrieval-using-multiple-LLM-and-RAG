Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the development and evaluation of ML/AI models in general. 

To ensure the generalizability of the model, the study adopted an 80% and 20% ratio for splitting the training and testing datasets, which is a common practice in machine learning. A total of 20 and 10 random sample locations were selected for the purposes of training and testing, respectively. 

Although cross-validation is mentioned in the context as a robust and versatile technique for model evaluation, it is not explicitly stated whether it was used in this particular study. Therefore, it is unclear whether cross-validation was employed to ensure the generalizability of the model. 

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
