Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and average precision. 

Precision is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. It represents the fraction of correctly classified objects among all classified objects.

Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It represents the proportion of expert-labeled objects that were also labeled by the deep learning model.

Average precision is used as a single model-performance metric, which takes into account the trade-off between precision and recall. It is the average of precision values over all observed recall values. The average precision of an ideal predictive model equals 1, meaning it always detects every class correctly.
