Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. This is evident from the context, which mentions "sound recordings" and "bird vocalizations" being used as input for the BirdNET system, which is a deep neural network for automated detection and classification of bird species. Additionally, the paper "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" by Tolkova et al. (2021) suggests that audio embeddings are used to analyze birdsong, further supporting the use of audio data in the pipeline.
