Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the values of the hyperparameters used in the training phase, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of interactions, but it does not explain how these values were determined. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
