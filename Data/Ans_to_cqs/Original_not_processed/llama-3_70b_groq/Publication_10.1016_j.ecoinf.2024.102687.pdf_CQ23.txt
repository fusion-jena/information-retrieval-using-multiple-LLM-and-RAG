Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained CNN backbones on the Darksound dataset and comparing their performance using different meta-metric learning architectures.

However, it is mentioned that the pre-trained CNN backbones were initially trained on the ImageNet database, a large and general dataset. This could be seen as a step towards ensuring generalizability, as the models were pre-trained on a diverse dataset before being fine-tuned on the specific Darksound dataset.

Additionally, the context suggests that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, such as bird sound datasets, could lead to higher quality classification. This implies that the authors are aware of the importance of dataset specificity and diversity in ensuring generalizability.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does provide some indirect hints and suggestions towards this direction.
