Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are related to the evaluation and selection of the model. 

The context mentions the calculation of the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated using this metric. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other common postprocessing steps. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps are involved in this specific context.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context appear to be limited to the calculation of the RTMSPE for model evaluation and selection.
