Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses machine learning algorithms and their applications in ecology and biology, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models. The mentioned algorithms are Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT), but none of them are deep learning frameworks.
