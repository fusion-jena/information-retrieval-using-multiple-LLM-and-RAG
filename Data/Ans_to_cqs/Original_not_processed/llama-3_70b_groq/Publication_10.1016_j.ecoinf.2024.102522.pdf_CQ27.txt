Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, bioclimate variables, and the spread of a pest species (Hyphantria cunea) through human activities. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
