Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some related concepts, such as the calculation of accuracy (section 5.1.5) and the confusion matrix (equation 9), which is used to calculate metrics such as true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

It can be inferred that after model training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and possibly other metrics that can be derived from the confusion matrix, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. However, the context does not mention specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after model training likely include metrics calculation and possibly the creation of a confusion matrix, but it does not provide information about other postprocessing steps like saliency maps.
