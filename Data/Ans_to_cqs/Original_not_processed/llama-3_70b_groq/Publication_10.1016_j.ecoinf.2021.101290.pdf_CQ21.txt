Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on event-stream processing, machine learning, and optogenetics, but it does not provide specific information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention data mining, querying languages, and machine learning methods, which could be related to postprocessing steps. Additionally, it highlights the importance of high-quality data for automated annotation and analysis, which might imply that some form of postprocessing or data evaluation is necessary. 

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query.
