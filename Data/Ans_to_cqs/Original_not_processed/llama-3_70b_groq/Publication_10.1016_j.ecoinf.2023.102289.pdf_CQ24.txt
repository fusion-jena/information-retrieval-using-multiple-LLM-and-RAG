Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. It discusses LaDeco, a tool for landscape element detection, and its various components, such as the default deeplabv3+resnet269 model, threshold setting, and output format. It also provides a list of references related to deep learning, semantic segmentation, and landscape architecture. However, it does not provide any information about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
