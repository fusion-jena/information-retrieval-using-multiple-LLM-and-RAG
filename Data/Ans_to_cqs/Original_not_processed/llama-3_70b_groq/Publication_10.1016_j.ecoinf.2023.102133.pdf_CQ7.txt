Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of Random Forest and other machine learning models, as well as the feature analysis and performance evaluation of these models. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
