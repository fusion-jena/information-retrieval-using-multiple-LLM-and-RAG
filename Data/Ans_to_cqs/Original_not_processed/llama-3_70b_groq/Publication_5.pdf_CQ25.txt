Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression tasks, specifically for predicting species richness. This is evident from the mention of "Deep Learning-Based Species Richness Model" and the comparison of the deep learning model with a random forest regression model. Additionally, the context mentions that deep learning networks are able to automatically learn arbitrary complex mappings from inputs to outputs, which is often the case in regression tasks. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
