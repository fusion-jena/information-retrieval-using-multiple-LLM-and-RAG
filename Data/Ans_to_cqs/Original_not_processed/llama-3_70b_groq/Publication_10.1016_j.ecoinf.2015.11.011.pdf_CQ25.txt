Answer: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of eCognition is for classification and segmentation. The text mentions that machine learning techniques are being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images. Additionally, it discusses the use of segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, including the development of methods and rule sets for automatically selecting segmentation parameters. The text also provides examples of how different bands and variables (such as NDVI, mean values of different bands, and texture variables) are used to segment and classify images. However, it does not mention detection as a purpose of the deep learning model.
