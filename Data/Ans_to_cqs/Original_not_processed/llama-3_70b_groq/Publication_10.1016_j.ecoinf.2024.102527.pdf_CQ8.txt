Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the methodology, results, and recommendations for a specific deep learning task, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
