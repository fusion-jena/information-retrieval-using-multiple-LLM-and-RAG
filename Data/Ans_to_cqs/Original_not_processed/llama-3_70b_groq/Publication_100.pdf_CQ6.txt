Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the implementation details, loss function, and experimental results, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that the input data consists of optical images and SAR images, which are used to train the model. The context also mentions that the model is trained on patches of size 15x15 pixels, and that the center pixel of each patch is required to be forested. This suggests that some form of data selection or filtering is performed, but the exact preprocessing steps are not specified.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
