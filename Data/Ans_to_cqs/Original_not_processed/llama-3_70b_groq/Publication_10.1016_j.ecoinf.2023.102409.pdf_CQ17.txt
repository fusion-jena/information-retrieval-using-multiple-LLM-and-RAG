Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and references to other studies. It discusses the use of specific models such as Deeplabv3+, Mobilenetv2, and TernausNet, as well as hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer. However, it does not provide information on regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
