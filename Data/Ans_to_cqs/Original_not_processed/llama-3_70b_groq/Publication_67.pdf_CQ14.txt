Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions that "two optimization techniques" are used during the training phase, but it does not specify what these techniques are. It is possible that the optimization techniques used are grid search, random search, or other methods, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided information.
