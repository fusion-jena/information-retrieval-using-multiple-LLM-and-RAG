Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, particularly the PBP method, and its application to the aphid data case study. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or analysis is performed after the model training, as the accuracy values, false positive rates, and true positive rates are reported in Table 2. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of interpretability in the PBP framework, which allows for the creation of visual representations of the patterns that occurred before the outbreak (the Pâ€² means matrix). 

But, specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix are not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps are involved in the PBP method or not.
