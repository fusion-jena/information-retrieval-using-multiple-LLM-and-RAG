Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and components of the pipeline, including the CA-Hybrid network, YOLOv7 localization network, and the integration of CNN and ViT modules. However, it does not provide information about where the pipeline's data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
