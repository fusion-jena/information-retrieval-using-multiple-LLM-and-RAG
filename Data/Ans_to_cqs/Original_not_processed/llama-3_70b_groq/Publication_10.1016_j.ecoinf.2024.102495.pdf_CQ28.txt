Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the configuration of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the feature extraction parameters, and the performance metrics, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
