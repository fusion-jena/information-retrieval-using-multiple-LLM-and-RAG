Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the development of novel deep learning models for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters, particularly on the use of semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning approaches. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors have attempted to address data bias by collecting a new fish dataset in turbid waters and weakly labeling it, which is mentioned as the world's first weakly-labeled fish dataset in turbid waters. This diverse data collection might help mitigate data bias to some extent. 

But, the context does not provide specific information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, it is unclear what specific techniques were used to address data bias in this particular deep learning pipeline.
