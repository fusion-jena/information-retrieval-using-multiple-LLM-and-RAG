Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the development of a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to detect stratification in a reservoir, including the definition of hyperparameters, the training process, and the optimization of hyperparameters. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
