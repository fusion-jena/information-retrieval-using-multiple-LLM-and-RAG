Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The text appears to be discussing ecological informatics, image classification, and scale sensitivity in the context of historical ecology. It mentions machine learning techniques being used for image classification, but it does not provide specific details about the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
