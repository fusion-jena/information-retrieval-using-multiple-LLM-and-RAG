Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study is an 80-10-10 split, where 80% of the preprocessed data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This split is employed to ensure a more extensive training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test set, which the model has not previously seen during the training or validation phases, indicates the model's performance in real-world scenarios.
