Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the network structures ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2 include weights pre-trained on ImageNet. This implies that ImageNet was used as a pre-training dataset, but it is not the primary dataset used for the specific task at hand. The primary dataset is not specified, but it is mentioned that it consists of images of species, with classes such as "No species".
