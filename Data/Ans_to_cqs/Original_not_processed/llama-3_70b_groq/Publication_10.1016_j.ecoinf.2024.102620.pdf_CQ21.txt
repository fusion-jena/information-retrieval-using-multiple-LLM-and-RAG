Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the PLUS model, its components, and its application in predicting NPP in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. It discusses the model's architecture, data sources, and some mathematical equations, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
