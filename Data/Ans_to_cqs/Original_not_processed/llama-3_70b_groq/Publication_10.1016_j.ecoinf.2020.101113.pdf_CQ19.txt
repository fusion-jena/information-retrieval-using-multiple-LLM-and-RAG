Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the model, which is based on ResNet50, and the pre-training dataset, which is ImageNet. It does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
