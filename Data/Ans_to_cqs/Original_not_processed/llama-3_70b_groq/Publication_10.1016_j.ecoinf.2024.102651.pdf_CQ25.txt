Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed to categorize Cervidae (deer species) localized by YOLOv7. The model uses a CA-Hybrid network, which combines CNN and ViT modules, to extract richer semantic features and improve the classification accuracy. The integration of CAM into the residual structure of ResNet helps the network to focus on critical features and enhance the feature representation capability. The model is evaluated on its ability to classify objects of different sizes, with medium-sized objects achieving higher classification accuracy compared to small objects.
