Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, nor does it specify the type of model used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche overlap, and conservation biology, but it does not provide information about the specific machine learning or deep learning models used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
