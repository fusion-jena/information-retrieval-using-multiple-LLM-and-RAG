Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to be discussing forest management and estimators for calculating diversity indices, with a focus on reducing bias and variance in these estimates. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks beyond the acronyms NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4, which seem to refer to specific estimators rather than deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
