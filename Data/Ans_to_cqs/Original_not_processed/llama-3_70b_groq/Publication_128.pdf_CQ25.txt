Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The context mentions that the model is used for large dataset classification, and it is trained to classify images of infected Mango leaves, woody images, and multi-spectral soybean images to identify the disease type. The model is also described as a classifier, and it has a fully connected layer with softmax activation that has 28 nodes, which is typical for classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions that the model achieved classification accuracy over 95% in the spectrum region of plant health, further supporting the idea that the purpose of the model is classification.
