Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions various data sources, such as Google Earth Engine, Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others, but it does not provide information about a repository where the pipeline itself is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
