Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the importance of generalizability and the use of bias-variance decomposition for evaluating the generalizability of machine learning models, but it does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure generalizability in the present study.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the importance of generalizability to unseen data, which suggests that the authors may have taken some measures to ensure generalizability, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific measures taken.

In general, ensuring generalizability is a crucial step in machine learning model development, and common techniques used to achieve this include using diverse and representative datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and regularization techniques. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine which specific techniques were used in this study.
