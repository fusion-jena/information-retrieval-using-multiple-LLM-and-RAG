Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions AutoGluon, which is an open-source AutoML library, and its approach emphasizes advanced data processing, deep learning, and ensemble techniques. However, it does not specify the underlying frameworks used to build the deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It may be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework, but it is not mentioned explicitly.
