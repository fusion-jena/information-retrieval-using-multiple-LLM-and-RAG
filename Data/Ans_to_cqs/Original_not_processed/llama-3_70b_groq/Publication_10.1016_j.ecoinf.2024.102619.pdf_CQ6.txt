Answer: According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are involved:

1. Resizing images to 224 pixels along the x-axis, preserving their aspect ratio.
2. Cropping the center of images to make them square.
3. Normalizing RGB values to the training dataset (ImageNet).
