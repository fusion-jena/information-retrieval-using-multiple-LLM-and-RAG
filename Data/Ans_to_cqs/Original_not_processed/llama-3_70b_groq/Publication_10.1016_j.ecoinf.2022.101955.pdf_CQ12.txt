Answer: 
The context provided does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The ANN model mentioned is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type, which is a traditional artificial neural network architecture, not a deep learning model. It is used for LULC classification and is implemented using the "nnet" package. Therefore, the answer is that no deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
