Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that the network is fed annotated data, and the parameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. It does not provide details on the type of annotation used.

However, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used is likely a form of classification annotation, as the context discusses image classification problems and the goal of assigning a single label from a set of several options to each image. But the specific technique used for annotation is not mentioned.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
