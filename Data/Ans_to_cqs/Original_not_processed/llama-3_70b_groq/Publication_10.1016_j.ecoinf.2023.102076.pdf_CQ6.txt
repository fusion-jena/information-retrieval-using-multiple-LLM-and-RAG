Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention tokenization as a preprocessing step.

According to the context, before feeding the texts into the BERT model, they are tokenized using the BERT tokenizer. The maximum number of tokens is set to 400 for social media posts and 512 for web articles. This implies that tokenization is a necessary step before training the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that documents are split into chunks of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer to identify the sections of text most likely to be relevant to the classification decision. This step can be considered as a form of preprocessing, but it is specific to the task of long document classification.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning may be necessary depending on the specific task and dataset. However, based on the provided context, these steps are not explicitly mentioned.
