Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, where it is stated that "a state-of-the-art CNN architecture called Inception-Resnet-v2" was used as a baseline model. Additionally, other CNN models such as Xception and MobileNetV2 are also mentioned as part of the ensemble approach. There is no mention of RNN or Transformer models in the provided context.
