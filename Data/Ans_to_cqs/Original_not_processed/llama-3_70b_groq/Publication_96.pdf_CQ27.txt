Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the methodology used for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Deep Learning techniques and Landsat 8 imagery, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. 

However, it is mentioned that the analysis was conducted using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations on the Google Cloud platform. This suggests that the model was likely deployed on the Google Cloud platform, but the exact process of deployment is not specified.
