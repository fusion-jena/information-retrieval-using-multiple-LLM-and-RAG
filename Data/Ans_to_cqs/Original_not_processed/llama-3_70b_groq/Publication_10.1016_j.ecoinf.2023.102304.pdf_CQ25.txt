Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text discusses XGBoost, Random Forest, and feature importance, but it does not mention deep learning models. It also talks about wildfire recovery, spectral bands, and various indices (e.g., EVI, NBR, NDVI), but it does not provide information about the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
