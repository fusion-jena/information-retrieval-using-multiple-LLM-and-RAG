Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically, it is designed for NBSB (Not specified in the context, but it can be inferred as "Non-Biological Signal-Based" or something similar) detection and counting. This is evident from the mention of "rapid detection" and "real-time applications" in the context, which suggests that the model is intended for detecting objects in images or videos in real-time. Additionally, the context discusses the YOLOv8 algorithm, which is a well-known object detection architecture.
