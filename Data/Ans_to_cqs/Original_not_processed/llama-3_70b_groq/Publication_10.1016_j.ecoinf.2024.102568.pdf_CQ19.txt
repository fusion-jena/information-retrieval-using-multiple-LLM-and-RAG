Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture and configuration of the LSTM model, including the loss function, optimization algorithm, and regularization method. It does not mention specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
