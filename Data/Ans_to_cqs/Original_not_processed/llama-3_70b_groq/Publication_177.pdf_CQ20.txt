Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the performance metrics of different models on two datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200, and mentions the use of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the models, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
