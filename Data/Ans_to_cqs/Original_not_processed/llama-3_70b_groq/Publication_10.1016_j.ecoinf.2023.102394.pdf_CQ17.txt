Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, the text states: "To reduce overfitting, we created dropout layers with dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.3 in this study." This indicates that dropout was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the model. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
