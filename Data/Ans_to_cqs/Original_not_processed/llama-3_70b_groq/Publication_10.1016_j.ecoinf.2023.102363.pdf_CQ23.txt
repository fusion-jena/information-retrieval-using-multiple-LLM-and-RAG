Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned with Gulf of Mexico data, which suggests that the model was adapted to a specific environment or dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained with different batch sizes (50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 frames) and evaluated on a test set, which could be indicative of some form of cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning. However, it is not clear if this was done to ensure generalizability or for other purposes.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information about the diversity of the dataset used for training and testing, which is an important aspect of ensuring generalizability.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
