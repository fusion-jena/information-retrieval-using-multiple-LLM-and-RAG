Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The context discusses tuning parameters of a machine learning model, specifically a decision tree-based model, and mentions the use of grid search to optimize hyperparameters. There is no mention of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The references provided are related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, but they do not provide information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
