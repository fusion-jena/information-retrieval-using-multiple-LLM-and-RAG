Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV in the pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with camera trap data. 

The mention of "camera trap data" suggests that the data might be in the form of images or videos, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the context does not provide any information about the data format used for training the models. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
