Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of different models on various datasets using metrics like UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
