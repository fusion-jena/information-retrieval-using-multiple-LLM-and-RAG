Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, such as LightGBM, RF, SVM, and XGboost, for predicting forest canopy cover using satellite remote sensing data. It does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that satellite remote sensing data is used as the primary source of data, as mentioned in the context. This suggests that the raw data might be collected through satellite imaging or other remote sensing technologies. But, the context does not provide further details on the specific methods or sources of data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
