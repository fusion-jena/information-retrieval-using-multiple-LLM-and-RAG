Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding and investigating the climatic hotspots implications within the sub-basins of the GAB region. However, it does not provide information on the specific task or application of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or regression.

Therefore, I don't know the specific purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
