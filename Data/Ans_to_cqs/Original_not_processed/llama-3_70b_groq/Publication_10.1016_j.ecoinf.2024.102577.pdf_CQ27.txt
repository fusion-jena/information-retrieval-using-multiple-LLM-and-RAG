Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article on using machine learning to aid sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, to build prediction models for species distribution. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
