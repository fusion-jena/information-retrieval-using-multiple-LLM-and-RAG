Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and references various papers, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the pipeline's data or code is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
