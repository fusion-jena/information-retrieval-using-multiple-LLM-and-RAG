Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the ESK model, for classifying fish from different families using DNA barcode sequences. It discusses the preprocessing of DNA barcode sequences, the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) for learning deep features, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for selecting a threshold to classify fish. However, it does not provide information on how the DNA barcode sequences were collected in the first place. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
