Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data. This is evident from the references to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and object detection techniques, which are commonly used for image classification and recognition tasks. Additionally, the mention of face recognition, elephant re-identification, and animal detection further supports the use of image data.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is worth noting that Bhagabati and Sarma (2016) highlighted various object detection techniques using video input, which suggests that video data might be used in some cases.

There is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV is typically used for tabular data, which is not directly related to the image-based deep learning applications mentioned in the context.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, with a possible mention of video data in some cases.
