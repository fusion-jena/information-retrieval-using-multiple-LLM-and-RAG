Answer:::
Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, which consists of an encoder part and a decoder part. The encoder part uses a modified ResNet-101 or Xception model as a feature extractor, and the decoder part up-samples the extracted feature map to produce the final segmentation results. Additionally, a pre-trained VGG16 network is also used in the pipeline for transfer learning on the dataset.
