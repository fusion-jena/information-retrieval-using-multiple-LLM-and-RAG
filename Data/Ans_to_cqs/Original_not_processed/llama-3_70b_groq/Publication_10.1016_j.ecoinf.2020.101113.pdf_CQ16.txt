Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the preprocessing of training data, the use of a CNN model, and the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the model, such as precision-recall curves and average precision. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
