Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The papers cited are related to image recognition, bird species monitoring, and avian diversity monitoring, but they do not mention datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

However, the paper by He et al. (2016) is about deep residual learning for image recognition, and it was presented at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. This suggests that the authors might have used a dataset like ImageNet for their research, but it is not explicitly stated.

The other papers focus on bird species monitoring and avian diversity monitoring, and they use the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model. There is no mention of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in these papers.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
