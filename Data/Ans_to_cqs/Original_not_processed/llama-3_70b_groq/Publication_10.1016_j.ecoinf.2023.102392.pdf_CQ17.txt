Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in forest fire vulnerability prediction, land use/land cover classification, and other ecological studies. It discusses the use of XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework, for classification tasks, but does not provide information on regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
