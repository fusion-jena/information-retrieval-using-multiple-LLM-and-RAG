Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on signal processing and classification tasks, particularly in the domain of ecological problems and fish event classification. There is no explicit mention of specific data formats used in the pipeline. However, we can make some inferences from the context.

The presence of references to 1D-CNNs and signal processing applications suggests that the data format might be related to time-series or signal data, which could be in formats such as CSV, WAV, or other formats used for storing signal data.

Additionally, the mention of bioacoustic signal classification and references to audio-related papers implies that audio data might be involved in the pipeline.

There is no mention of image or video data formats, which suggests that they might not be directly involved in the pipeline. However, it's possible that some intermediate representations or features might be extracted from images or videos, but this is not explicitly stated.

In summary, based on the context, it's likely that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to signal or audio data, but the exact formats are not specified.
