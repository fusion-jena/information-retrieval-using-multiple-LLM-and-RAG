Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression. This is evident from the description of the output layer, which is a combination of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value. This suggests that the model is designed to predict a continuous value, which is a characteristic of regression problems. Additionally, the text mentions that the focus is on dealing with regression problems, further supporting this conclusion.
