Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to discuss various techniques for feature extraction and classification, including SVM, HMM, and ANN, but it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning. The only mention of deep learning is in the context of Birdnet, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
