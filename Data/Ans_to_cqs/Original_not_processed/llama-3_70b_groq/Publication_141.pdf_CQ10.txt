Answer::: 
Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of deep learning CNN architectures for biomonitoring studies and the application of a ResNet-50 network architecture with transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout. There is no reference to a specific code repository or link.
