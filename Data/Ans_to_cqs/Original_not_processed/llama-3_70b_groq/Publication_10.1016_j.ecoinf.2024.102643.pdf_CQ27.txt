Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a study on human-bear conflicts, and it discusses various statistical models and techniques used in the study, such as MAXENT, RF, ANN, MARS, GBM, CTA, FDA, and SRE. However, it does not provide any information about deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
