Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to air quality and pollution, with references to various studies and research papers. The only mention of a deep learning model is in the paper "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020), but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
