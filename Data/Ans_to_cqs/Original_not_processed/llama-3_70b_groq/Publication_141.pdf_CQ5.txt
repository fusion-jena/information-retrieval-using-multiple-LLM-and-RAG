Answer:::
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned, but it is mentioned that the ResNet-50 network architecture was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, the authors mention that their own dataset was constructed under a lab-based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position of the larvae (ventral point of view). This suggests that the authors used a custom dataset of images of Chironomidae larvae for their biomonitoring study.
