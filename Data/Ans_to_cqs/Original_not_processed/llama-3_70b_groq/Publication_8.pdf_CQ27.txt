Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process, including the use of transfer learning, the selection of the minibatch size, and the training iterations. It also mentions the Python code and the trained model, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
