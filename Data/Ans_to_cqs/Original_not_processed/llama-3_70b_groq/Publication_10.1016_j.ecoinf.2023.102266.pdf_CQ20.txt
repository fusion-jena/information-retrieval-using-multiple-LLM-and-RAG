Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses a classification model built upon the Monte Carlo method, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. It only mentions the limitations of the model in terms of requiring extensive computational resources to attain an adequate level of result confidence. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, are used for training the model.
