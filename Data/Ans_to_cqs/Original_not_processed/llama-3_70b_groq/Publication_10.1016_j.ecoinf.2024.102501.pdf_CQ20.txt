Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The context focuses on the different machine learning and deep learning models used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, such as LSTM, GRU, SVM, and others, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
