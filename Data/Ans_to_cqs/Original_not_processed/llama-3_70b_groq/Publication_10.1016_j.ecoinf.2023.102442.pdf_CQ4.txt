Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and geospatial analysis, with references to papers on topics like detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and large-scale degradation of freshwater ecosystems. While some of the papers may involve deep learning models, the specific techniques used for data augmentation are not mentioned.
