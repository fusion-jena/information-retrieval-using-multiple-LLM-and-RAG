Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a passage discussing atmospheric correction (AC) in remote sensing, citing various research papers and algorithms used for AC in different aquatic environments. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
