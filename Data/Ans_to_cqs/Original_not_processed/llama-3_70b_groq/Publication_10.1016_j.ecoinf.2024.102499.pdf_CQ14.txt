Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the dataset, the training and testing process, and references some papers, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used to optimize the hyperparameters.
