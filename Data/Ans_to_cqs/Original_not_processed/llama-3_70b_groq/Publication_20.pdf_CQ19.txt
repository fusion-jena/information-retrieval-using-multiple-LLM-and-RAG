Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the model, which is a GoogLeNet architecture, and provides details about the training process, hyperparameters, and performance. It does not mention TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other specific framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
