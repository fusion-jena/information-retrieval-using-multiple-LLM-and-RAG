Answer:::

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to discuss a framework for reporting and managing data, specifically in the context of environmental monitoring, and does not touch on deep learning or data bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
