Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to data analysis, specifically tracking vocalizations of different song structures, and presents a table with the number of tracks and percentages of each song variant.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide any information about model training or postprocessing steps.
