Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

For SEIO PBW vocalization training, the batch size is 5 and the learning rate is 1e-4. 
For blue whale Dcall training, the batch size is 4 and the learning rate is 1e-3. 

The models were trained for 40 and 25 epochs, respectively, with an early stopping method used to prevent overfitting. The patience parameter is set at 10 epochs for all training phases. 

No information is provided about the optimizer used in the model.
