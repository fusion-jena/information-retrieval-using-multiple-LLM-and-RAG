Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. The context only provides information about the number of images in each set, but it does not explain how these images were selected or what criteria were used to split the data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
