Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training phase of the MLPNN, including the assignment of initial connection weights, forward-feeding of inputs, error computation, and iterative error back-propagation. It also mentions the selection of optimal hyperparameters and the use of the trained network for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.
