Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on environmental pollution, water quality management, and the application of machine learning algorithms like Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and Random Forest (RF) for analyzing and predicting water quality parameters. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
