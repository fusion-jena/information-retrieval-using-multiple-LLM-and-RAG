Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in deep learning. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, with topics such as vegetation dynamics, climate changes, soil seed banks, and remote sensing. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning techniques, except for one paper that uses machine learning to attribute vegetation change to climate and human activities. However, this paper does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
