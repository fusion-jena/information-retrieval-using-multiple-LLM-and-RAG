Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The study focuses on developing a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, and it discusses various challenges and issues related to fish image processing and biomass estimation. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention some references to other studies that have used deep learning techniques for fish detection and species classification, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in those studies either. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
