Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model being used in a pipeline. The text discusses the development of neural networks, Bayesian learning machines, and support vector machines (SVM), but it does not specify a particular deep learning model being used in a pipeline. It mentions that deep learning started to boom in academia and industry since 2006, but it does not provide information about a specific model being used in a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
