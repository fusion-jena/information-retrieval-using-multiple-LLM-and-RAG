Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training process, parameter settings, and dataset information. It discusses the training framework used (Caffe), learning rate, batch size, momentum, weight decay, and dropout ratio, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
