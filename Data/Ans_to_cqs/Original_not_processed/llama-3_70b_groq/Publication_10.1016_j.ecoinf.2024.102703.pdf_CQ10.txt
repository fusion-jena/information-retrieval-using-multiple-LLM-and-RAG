Answer: I don't know.

The provided context consists of a list of scientific papers and articles, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or provide a code repository link. The papers appear to be related to environmental science, ecology, and biology, and they discuss topics such as dissolved organic matter, fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyanobacterial dominance in lakes. There is no mention of deep learning or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not relevant to the provided context.
