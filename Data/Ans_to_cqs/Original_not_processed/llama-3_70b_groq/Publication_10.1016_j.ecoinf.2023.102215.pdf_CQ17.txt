Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the U2-Net and TrunkNet models, as well as the use of dilated convolutions to extract global information. It does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
