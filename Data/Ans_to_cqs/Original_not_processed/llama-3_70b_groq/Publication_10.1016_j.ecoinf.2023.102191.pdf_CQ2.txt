Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any data formats used in such a pipeline. The text discusses a mobile app called Dive Reporter that collects data on marine taxa sightings from recreational SCUBA divers, along with metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers. It also mentions that the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, which could be validated by experts or using machine learning. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline.
