Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The first reference mentions "novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping", but it does not specify the exact purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). Without more information, it is impossible to determine the purpose of the deep learning model.
