Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image feature extraction using deep learning models, specifically ResNet-50, and its application in image classification. It does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
