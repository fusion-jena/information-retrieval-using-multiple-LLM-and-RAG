Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was assessed on the validation set, which consisted of images #2, #4, and #6. The network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on a separate dataset during training, but the specific metrics or strategy used to monitor the performance are not mentioned.
