Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of different classification networks, including ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid, for microorganism and Cervidae classification tasks. It discusses the integration of CAM into the residual structure of ResNet, the use of YOLOv7 for object localization, and the comparison of classification accuracy for small and medium objects. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
