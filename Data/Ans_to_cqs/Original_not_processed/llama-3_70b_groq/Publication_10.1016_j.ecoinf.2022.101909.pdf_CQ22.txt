Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). 

Precision and recall are inversely related metrics that are used to evaluate the model's performance. The precision-recall curve is used to analyze the trade-off between these two metrics. The average precision (AP) is computed to summarize the precision-recall curve in a single value. The AP is the weighted metric of the achieved precisions in each threshold, with the increase in the previously used threshold recall being weighted.

The F1-score is also used to evaluate the model's performance. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balance between these two metrics. The F1-score is used to find the optimal threshold that balances precision and recall.

The mean Average Precision (mAP) is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the multiclass classification models. It is the average of all the AP obtained by each class. The mAP is independent of the selected threshold for the implementation of the model, and its value closer to one indicates a better model.

Accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance in this context.
