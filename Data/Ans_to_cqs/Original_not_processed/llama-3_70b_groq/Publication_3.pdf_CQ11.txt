Answer::: 
Answer: The data repository link is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data are publicly available via Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds (https://www.macaulaylibrary.org). This link is not a traditional data repository link like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but rather a library of natural sounds where the data can be accessed.
