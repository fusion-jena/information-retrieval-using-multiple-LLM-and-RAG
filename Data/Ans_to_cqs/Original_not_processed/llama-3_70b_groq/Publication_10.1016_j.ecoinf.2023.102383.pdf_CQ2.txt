Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image data, specifically UAV thermal images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats. The context discusses feature maps, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and object detection, which are all related to image processing and computer vision tasks. The figures mentioned, such as Fig. 4 and Fig. 8, also suggest that image data is being used. Therefore, the answer is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
