Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as BirdNET. The context only mentions research papers and projects, but it does not provide a link to a code repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
