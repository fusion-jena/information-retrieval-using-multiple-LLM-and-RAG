Answer:::
The context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that 80% of the data was used as the training set, and the remaining 20% was used as the evaluation set to assess model performance. This suggests that the data was split into a training set and an evaluation set, but it does not provide information on whether a validation set was used or what criteria were used to split the data.
