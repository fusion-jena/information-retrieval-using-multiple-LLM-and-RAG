Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only mentions that the models were trained and tested, and the results are presented in Table 2, which shows the average evaluation measures over ten independent executions for the four different methods. This suggests that some form of repetition or resampling was used to evaluate the models, but the exact method is not specified. Therefore, I don't know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
