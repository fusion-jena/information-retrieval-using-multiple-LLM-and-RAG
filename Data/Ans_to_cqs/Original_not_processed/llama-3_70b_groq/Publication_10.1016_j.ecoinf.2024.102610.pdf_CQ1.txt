Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve a combination of sources. 

One of the methods mentioned is crowdsourcing, as seen in the reference to Laaksonen et al. (2017), which involved a nationwide tick collection effort in Finland. This suggests that citizen science or crowdsourced data may be used as a source of raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions various public datasets and sources, such as WorldPop, TerraClimate, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). These datasets likely provide environmental and climate-related data that are used as inputs to the deep learning model.

There is no explicit mention of surveys or sensors as data collection methods in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in conjunction with the mentioned sources to collect raw data.

Overall, the data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline appear to involve a combination of crowdsourced data and public datasets, but the exact scope of methods used is not fully specified in the provided context.
