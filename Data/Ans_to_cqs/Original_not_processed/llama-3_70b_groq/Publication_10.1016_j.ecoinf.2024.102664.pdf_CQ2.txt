Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the study uses segmented images with a size of 3x3, which are generated by iteratively moving a window pixel-by-pixel over a grid of 100x40 points. The data structure for the model input is 9x5x13, indicating that the images are used as input to the CNN model. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
