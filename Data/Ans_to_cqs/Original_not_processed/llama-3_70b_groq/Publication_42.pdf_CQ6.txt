Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different CNN architectures, their performance, and the effect of hyperparameters on the model's accuracy. It discusses the use of data augmentation, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.
* Data normalization: Scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Data scaling: Scaling the input data to a specific range, such as between -1 and 1, to improve the model's performance.
* Feature scaling: Scaling individual features to a common range to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.

However, without explicit information in the provided context, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular case.
