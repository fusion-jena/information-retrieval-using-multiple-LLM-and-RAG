Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The text focuses on the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution based on bioclimatic variables, and it compares this approach to other methods used in species distribution modeling. It does mention the use of deep learning models in other studies, but it does not provide information on how these models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
