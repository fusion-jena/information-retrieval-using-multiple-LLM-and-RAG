Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. The context appears to be related to a research article on ecological informatics, specifically on classifying animal population time series using machine learning techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and hierarchical clustering. There is no mention of deep learning or datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
