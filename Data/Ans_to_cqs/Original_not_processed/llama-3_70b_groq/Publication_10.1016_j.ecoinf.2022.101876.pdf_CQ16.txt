Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of a model's performance on a dataset, providing various metrics such as accuracy, error rate, F1 score, and others. However, it does not discuss the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete.

Typically, criteria for determining when training is complete may include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance on the validation set, or reaching a certain level of accuracy or F1 score. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
