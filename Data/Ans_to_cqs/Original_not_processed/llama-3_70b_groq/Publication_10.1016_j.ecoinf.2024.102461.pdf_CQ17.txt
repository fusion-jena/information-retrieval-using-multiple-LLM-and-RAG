Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on fire risk mapping using remote sensing data and various modeling techniques, including artificial neural networks and logistic regression. However, it does not provide specific information about regularization methods used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
