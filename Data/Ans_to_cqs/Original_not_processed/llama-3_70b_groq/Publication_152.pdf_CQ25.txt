Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification and segmentation. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify the invasive vegetation species, Heidychium Coronarium, from UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images. The model uses a U-Net architecture, which is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. The goal is to accurately identify and distinguish the target species from native vegetation. The model is trained on a dataset of images collected by a UAV, and the results are evaluated using metrics such as F1 score and Jaccard index.
