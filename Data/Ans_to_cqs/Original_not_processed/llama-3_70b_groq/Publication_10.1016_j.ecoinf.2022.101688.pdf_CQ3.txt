Answer: The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used is a form of temporal annotation, where the start and end times of the audio segments are annotated. This is evident from the description of the sliding window approach used to extract audio segments, where each annotation contains a start and end time, and the window is moved by one second in time to extract multiple segments. This technique is used to create a dataset containing various audio segments for the presence and absence classes.
