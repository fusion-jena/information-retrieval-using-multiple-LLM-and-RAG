Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that 50% of the training data were held-out for validation, which suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method is not specified. It could be grid search, random search, or some other method, but the text does not provide enough information to determine this. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
