Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques for image classification and annotation in marine ecosystems.

It discusses the use of pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tuning on the Benthoz15 dataset, as well as the extraction of activation vectors from the first fully connected layer as feature representations. Additionally, it mentions spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which make CNNs independent of input image size and robust for diverse classification and recognition applications.

However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
