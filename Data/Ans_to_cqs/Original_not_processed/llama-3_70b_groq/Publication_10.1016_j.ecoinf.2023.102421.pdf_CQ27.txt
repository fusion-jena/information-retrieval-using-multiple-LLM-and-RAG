Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process, hyperparameter optimization, and model selection, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. It does not mention model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
