Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning models for object detection, specifically YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their application to drone imagery for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters. It also provides information about the dataset, data augmentation, and training and validation datasets. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
