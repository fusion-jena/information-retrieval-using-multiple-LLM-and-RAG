Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is the addition of Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers behind the 22 convolutional layers. This is mentioned in the sentence: "We add new kind of BNorm layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting when we trained models using BatNet (Fig. 2C)." 

However, it does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
