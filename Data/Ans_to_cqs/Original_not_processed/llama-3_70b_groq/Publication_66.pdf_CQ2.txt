Answer::: 

The context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has been carrying out an extensive seabird-monitoring project, and the data used in the analysis includes GPS track data, GPS and dive data, and associated matrices. 

It can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline might include CSV or similar formats for storing GPS coordinates and dive data. However, it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
