Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model, including model serialization and platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, citing various research studies and papers. It does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
