Answer:::

The context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of multiple machine learning models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR).

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the authors mention that they extended the model to Northeast China in 2023, which indicates that they tested the model on a different dataset or region. This can be seen as a form of external validation or out-of-sample testing, which helps to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data was split into training and verification sets in a ratio of 3:1, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used for model evaluation.
