Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline or the methods used for data collection. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are queries that describe a set of localities in terms of dental traits and climate variables. The context explains the parameters and constraints used in this method, but it does not provide information about data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
