Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model (not specifically deep learning) in the context of cross-validation. These metrics are:

* Coefficient of determination (R2)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE)

It does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of classification models.
