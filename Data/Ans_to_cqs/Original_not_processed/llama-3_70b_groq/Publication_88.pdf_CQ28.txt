Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the EF network, the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, and the results of the model's performance. There is no mention of the deployment platform.
