Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text only mentions that each network was trained and executed three times, each time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters and with a different data fold. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into folds or what proportion of the data was used for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
