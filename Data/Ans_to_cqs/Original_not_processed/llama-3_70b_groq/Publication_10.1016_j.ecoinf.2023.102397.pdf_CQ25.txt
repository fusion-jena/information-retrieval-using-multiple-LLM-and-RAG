Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON) is species identification based on audio recordings. Specifically, it is used for detecting and classifying bird species from audio data. This is evident from the mention of the model working with one or two ROIs (region of interest, template, that contains the desired vocalization) and the training data containing validated recordings of the presence or absence of the vocalization provided by the user. The model outputs a score that indicates the likelihood of the presence of the target species, with a threshold value set by the user to determine the classification outcome.
