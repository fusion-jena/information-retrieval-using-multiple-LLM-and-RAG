Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses the use of a pre-trained CNN architecture (inception model) fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
