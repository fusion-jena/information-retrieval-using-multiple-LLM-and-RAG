Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. It discusses model fitting and assessment using GLM, GAM, and RF models, and provides details on the input data and arguments for the covsel functions. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
