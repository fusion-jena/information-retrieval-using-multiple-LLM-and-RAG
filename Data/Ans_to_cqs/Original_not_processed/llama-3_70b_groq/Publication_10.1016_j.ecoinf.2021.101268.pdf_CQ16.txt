Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different neural network architectures, their accuracy on different datasets, and the details of the training process, including the optimizer, learning rate, and batch size. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
