Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some techniques that can be related to handling randomness.

One such technique is the use of random ten-crop testing with smaller data augmentation parameters than those used during training. This suggests that the authors are using data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, which can be affected by randomness.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring during training, which can also help to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

However, there is no explicit mention of setting a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
