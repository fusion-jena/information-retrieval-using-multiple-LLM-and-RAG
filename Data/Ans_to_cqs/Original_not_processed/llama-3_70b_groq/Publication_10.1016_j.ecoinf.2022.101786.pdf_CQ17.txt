Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "early stopping" as a technique to prevent overfitting, which is a regularization method. Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.

The context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these methods were used or not.
