Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to focus on the analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross-validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation, as well as the application of machine learning technologies to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas. It also discusses the ranking of models based on various statistical measures and data splitting for training and testing datasets. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained deep learning model.
