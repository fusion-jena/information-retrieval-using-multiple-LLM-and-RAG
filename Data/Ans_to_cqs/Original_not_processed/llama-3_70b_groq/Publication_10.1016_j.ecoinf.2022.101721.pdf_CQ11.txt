Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing species identification using machine learning and statistical methods, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. The mentioned references are academic papers, and there is no mention of a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository.
