Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically hybrid CNN-LSTM models, for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the performance of these models, their advantages, and the importance of satellite data in machine learning-based forecasting.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to handle randomness by setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as weight initialization, dropout, and shuffling of data. By setting a fixed random seed, researchers can ensure that their results are consistent and reproducible across different runs of the same experiment.

In the absence of explicit information on this topic in the provided context, I cannot provide a more specific answer.
