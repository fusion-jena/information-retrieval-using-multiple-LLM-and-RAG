Answer: 

The context provided does not mention deep learning models or the specific criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the authors employed cross-validation to test the model performance, where 70% of the dataset was used as training data and the remaining 30% was used as testing data. This suggests that the authors used a 70-30 split for training and testing their models, but it does not provide information on validation sets or deep learning models specifically.
