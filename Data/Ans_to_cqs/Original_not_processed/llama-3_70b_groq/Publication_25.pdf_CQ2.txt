Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and red, green, blue (RGB) data. This is mentioned in Figure 1, which describes the conceptual pipeline as using LIDAR-based unsupervised detection to generate initial training data for an RGB deep learning model. 

It can be inferred that the pipeline uses 3D point cloud data from LIDAR and 2D image data in RGB format. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if other data formats such as CSV, audio, or video are used in the pipeline.
