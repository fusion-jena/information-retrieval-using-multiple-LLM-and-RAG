Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate. However, it does mention the optimizers used, which are Adam, SGDm, and RMSProp. These are listed in Table 1 as the "Solver for training network" for the different deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM).
