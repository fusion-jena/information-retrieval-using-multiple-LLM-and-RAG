Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that annotated databases are often weakly labeled, mainly because the labeling is often imprecise or lacks temporal localization details (i.e., start and end time of sound events).

It also mentions that recent ecoacoustic studies have introduced interactive visualization techniques and a data-centric function that automatically segments bird sounds in soundscape recordings to improve the quality of the recording dataset. This has allowed the design of suitable pseudo-labeling functions to build high-quality training datasets with minimum expert annotation effort.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data annotation techniques used in this context might involve interactive visualization and automatic segmentation of sound events, but the specific techniques used are not explicitly stated.
