Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "Convolutional neural networks" in the keywords section and the reference to "CNNs" in the text. Additionally, the mention of "ResNet50" in the baseline comparison section, which is a type of CNN architecture, further supports this conclusion.
