Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) modeling, the parameter selection process, and references to various studies and techniques. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
