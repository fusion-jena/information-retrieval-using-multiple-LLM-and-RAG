Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the optimization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model for ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. The context includes tables, figures, and text discussing the model's performance, feature extraction, and optimization, but it does not mention specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
