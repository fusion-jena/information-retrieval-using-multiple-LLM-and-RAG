Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is hosted. The context discusses various topics such as coral cover, zoning, heat stress, wave stress, and synthetic data, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
