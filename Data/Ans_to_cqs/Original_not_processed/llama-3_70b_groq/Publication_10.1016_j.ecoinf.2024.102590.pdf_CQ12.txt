Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that "deep learning CNN" could be used in future LULC analysis, suggesting that CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) might be a potential option. But it is not explicitly stated as the model used in the current pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
