Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. 

Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive to all positive predicted samples, calculated as TP / (TP + FP). Recall, also known as sensitivity, is defined as the number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples, calculated as TP / (TP + FN). The F1-score is a general indicator of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). 

Accuracy is measured by calculating the ratio of true positive and true negative to the overall collected samples, calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN). These metrics are used to compare the performance of the proposed model EMViT-Net with other state-of-the-art deep learning models on the validation set and test set of the EMDS-6 dataset.
