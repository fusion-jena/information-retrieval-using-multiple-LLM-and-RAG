Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data preprocessing in the context of spectral analysis. Specifically, it mentions the RL preprocessing method, but it does not provide details on what this method entails.

Additionally, the context mentions data preprocessing in ViewSpecPro and the Unscrambler, but it does not specify the exact preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
