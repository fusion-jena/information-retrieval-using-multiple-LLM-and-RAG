Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are mentioned in the proposed preprocessing approach (Fig. 2). Although the specific steps are not explicitly listed, we can infer the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Unknown steps**: The first two steps of the proposed preprocessing methodology are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot determine what these steps entail.

2. **Step-3: Normalize the signal amplitude**: The third step involves normalizing the signal amplitude. This is likely to ensure that the signal amplitude is consistent across different recording devices, as mentioned in the context, which can capture varying sound pressure levels depending on the manufacturing materials and degradation.

No other preprocessing steps, such as scaling or cleaning, are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these steps are involved in the preprocessing approach.
