Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that the authors employed cross-validation to test the model performance and used the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as an index to specify the accuracy of the models. 

It can be inferred that the authors calculated the AUC metric to evaluate the performance of their models, but there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other metrics calculation. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to this query based on the provided context.
