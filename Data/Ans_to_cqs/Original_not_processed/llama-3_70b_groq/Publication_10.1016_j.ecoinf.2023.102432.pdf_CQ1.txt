Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from remote sensing images, specifically from NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat imagery. The context mentions that pixels' spectral data were extracted from the imagery using buffer polygons, which were set to the image's spatial resolution. This suggests that the raw data is collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. The focus seems to be on using remote sensing images as the primary source of data for the machine learning approach.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on the deep learning pipeline, as it primarily discusses the Random Forest approach and the processing of remote sensing data. Therefore, it's unclear if deep learning is even used in this specific pipeline.
