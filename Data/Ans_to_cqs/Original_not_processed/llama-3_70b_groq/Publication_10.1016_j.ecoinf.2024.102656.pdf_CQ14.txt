Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS), the importance of various environmental variables in predicting habitat suitability, and the methodology for assessing landscape resistance and identifying core areas for conservation. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used.
