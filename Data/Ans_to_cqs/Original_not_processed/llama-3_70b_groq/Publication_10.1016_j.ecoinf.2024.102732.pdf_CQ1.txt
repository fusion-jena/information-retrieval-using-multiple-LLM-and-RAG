Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field data: This is mentioned in the abstract, suggesting that data is collected through field observations and measurements.
2. Remote sensing: The context mentions the use of remote sensing data, specifically ALOS2 and NDVI, to estimate forest above-ground biomass.
3. Public datasets: The use of public datasets is implied by the mention of the USGS EarthExplorer website, which provides SRTM DEM data.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other studies or applications not mentioned in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it's possible that other methods may be used in addition to those mentioned above.
