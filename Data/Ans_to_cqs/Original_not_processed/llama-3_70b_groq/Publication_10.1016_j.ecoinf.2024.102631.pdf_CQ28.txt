Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of the model on various datasets, compares it with other models, and provides information about its processing time and attention mechanisms. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
