Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that the analysis uses artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural networks. 

It is worth noting that the context also mentions LeafNet, which is a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in LeafNet. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is MLP, which is a type of feedforward neural network. However, it does not provide information about the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models.
