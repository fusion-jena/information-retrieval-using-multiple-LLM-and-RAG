Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning techniques for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices, but it does not include any information about the code implementation or repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
