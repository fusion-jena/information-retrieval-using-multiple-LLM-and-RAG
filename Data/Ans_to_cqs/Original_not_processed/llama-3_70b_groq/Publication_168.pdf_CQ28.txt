Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the proposed method for forest species classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and hyperspectral image (HSI) captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). It discusses the experiment, results, and framework of the proposed method but does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
