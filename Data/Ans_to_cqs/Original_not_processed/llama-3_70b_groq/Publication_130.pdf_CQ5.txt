Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context mentions that the study involves collecting training pictures of birds, specifically zebra finches and great tits, for individual recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The datasets used in this study are custom datasets created for this specific purpose, with the number of images per bird varying between species. For example, the zebra finch data required 400 pictures for training and 100 for validation, while the sociable weavers and great tits required 1,000 images per bird, with 900 for training and 100 for validation.
