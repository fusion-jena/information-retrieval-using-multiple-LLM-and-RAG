Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and their applications, limitations, and evaluation. It mentions techniques such as factor interactions, convolutional neural networks, and joint species distribution models (jSDMs), but these are not data augmentation techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines. The context does not provide any information about flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are common data augmentation techniques used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
