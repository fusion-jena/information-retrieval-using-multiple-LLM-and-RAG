Answer: 

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing the performance of a WT-HMM (Wavelet-Transform Hidden Markov Model) algorithm on a dataset of audio recordings, and how the dataset size affects the classification performance. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
