Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer were tuned using an iterative grid search parameter tuning method. It also mentions the number of trainable parameters, computational run-time, and training batch size, but does not provide information about the learning rate and optimizer used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
