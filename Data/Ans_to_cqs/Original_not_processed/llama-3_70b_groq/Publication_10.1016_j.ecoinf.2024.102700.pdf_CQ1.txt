Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Dedicated surveys: These involve in-situ surveys conducted along predetermined routes, often following an equal coverage probability design. Visual and acoustic methods are used in these surveys, with visual methods including transect methods.
2. Opportunistic in-situ surveys: These are conducted as part of other research activities aimed at different scientific scopes.
3. Citizen science social media records: These are collected in an unstandardized manner.
4. Large databases: These are used to collect data, although the specific methods used to collect the data in these databases are not specified.

It is also mentioned that temperature measurements are primarily related to surface temperatures, with only a few articles considering other types of temperature measurements.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these methods are used or not based on the provided context.
