Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). 

The average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies are 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The average unweighted and weighted accuracies for the test data are 94.7% and 88.8%. The F1-scores for the training and testing datasets are 0.980 and 0.907, respectively. 

Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) is also used as a metric, computed by a Riemann sum. 

There is no mention of precision and recall scores in the provided context, except for a mention of recall scores in the validation database performance section, which are stated to be "fairly comparable" but no specific values are provided.
