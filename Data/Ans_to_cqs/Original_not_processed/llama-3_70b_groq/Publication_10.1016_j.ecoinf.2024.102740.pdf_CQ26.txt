Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on random forest, machine learning, and remote sensing applications in grassland management. It discusses the use of random forest for classification and regression tasks, but it does not provide information on techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random forest, which is an ensemble learning method that can be robust to some types of bias. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples for estimating the generalization error, which can provide some insights into the model's performance on unseen data.

But, to specifically answer the question about techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, the provided context does not provide any information. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
