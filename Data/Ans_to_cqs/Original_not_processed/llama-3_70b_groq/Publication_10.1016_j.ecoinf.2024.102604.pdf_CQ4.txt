Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing sampling bias correction methods in environmental spaces, with a focus on evaluating the effectiveness of different correction methods using metrics such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and Î”D. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
