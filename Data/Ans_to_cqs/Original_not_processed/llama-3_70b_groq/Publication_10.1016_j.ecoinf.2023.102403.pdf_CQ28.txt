Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or using any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing biodiversity infrastructure, online repositories, and databases related to marine information, specifically FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. It also mentions data curation and filtering processes, but there is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
