Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the best-performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model during testing. This suggests that the validation loss is used as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training, and the training process may be stopped when the validation loss reaches a certain threshold or plateaus. However, the specific criteria or threshold used to determine when training is complete is not specified in the provided context.
