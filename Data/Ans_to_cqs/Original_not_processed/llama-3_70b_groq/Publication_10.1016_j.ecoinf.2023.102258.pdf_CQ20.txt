Answer: The context mentions that "in deep learning, long audio files are usually divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs." This implies that GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are used as the hardware resource for training the deep learning model. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in the provided context.
