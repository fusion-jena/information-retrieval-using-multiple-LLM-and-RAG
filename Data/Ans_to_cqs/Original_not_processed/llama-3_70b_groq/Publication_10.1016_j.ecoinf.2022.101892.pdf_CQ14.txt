Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the experimental setup, the calculation of MAE values, and the comparison of different models in terms of their performance and inference speed. It also provides tables and figures showing the results of the experiments, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
