Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, preprocessing, or techniques to address data bias. The context appears to be discussing data citation, data packages, and data stewardship in the context of the ESS-DIVE program. It mentions challenges related to citing data, data usage policies, and acknowledging the roles of data curators, but it does not provide information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.
