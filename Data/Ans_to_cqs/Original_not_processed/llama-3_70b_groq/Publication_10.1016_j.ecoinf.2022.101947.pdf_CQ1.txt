Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) pipeline is through camera traps or smartphones. The data collectors take images of footprints, specifically left and right hind footprints, according to the FIT protocol. This method is used to collect data on species such as tigers, black rhinoceros, Lowland tapir, and Giant panda. The images are then stored on an external or cloud-based drive and analyzed using a standard home-office laptop computer.

It does not appear that surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in the FIT pipeline. The context does not mention these methods, and instead, focuses on the use of camera traps and smartphones to collect images of footprints.
