Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only mentions that supplementary data to the article can be found online at a specific DOI (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102516), but it does not specify the repository where the data is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
