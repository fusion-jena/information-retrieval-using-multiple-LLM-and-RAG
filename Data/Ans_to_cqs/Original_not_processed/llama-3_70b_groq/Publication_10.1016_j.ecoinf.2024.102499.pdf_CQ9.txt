Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions the TensorFlow model zoo, which is a repository of pre-trained models, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
