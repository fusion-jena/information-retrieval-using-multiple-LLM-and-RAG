Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation, but it does not provide details about the specific model architecture used. The context focuses on the application of ML in aquatic environmental monitoring, particularly for the estimation of Chl-a concentrations, and the development of algorithms for atmospheric correction. However, it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
