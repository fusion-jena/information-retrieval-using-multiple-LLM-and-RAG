Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the importance of deep learning in agriculture, the need for advances in deep learning techniques, and the implementation details of a neural network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query.
