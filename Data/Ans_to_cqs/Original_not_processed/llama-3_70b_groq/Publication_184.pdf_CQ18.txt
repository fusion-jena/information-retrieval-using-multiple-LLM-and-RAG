Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the calculation of loss, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) during the training process. The graph illustrating the loss while training the neural network shows a rapid decline around 1000 iterations, indicating that the model's performance is being monitored and evaluated. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance improves swiftly in terms of precision, recall, and mAP before plateauing after about 1000 iterations, suggesting that these metrics are being used to monitor the model's performance during training.
