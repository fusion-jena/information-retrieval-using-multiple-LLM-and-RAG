Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the importance of image augmentations, transfer learning, and the use of ResNet-101 and Mask R-CNN models, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques employed during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
