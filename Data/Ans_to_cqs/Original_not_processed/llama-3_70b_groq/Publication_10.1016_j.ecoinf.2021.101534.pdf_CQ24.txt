Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for audio-based bird species identification, including data preparation, model training, and case studies. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
