Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and their application to classify blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. It mentions parameters such as the number of states, mixture weights, and emission distribution parameters, but these are specific to HMMs and not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
