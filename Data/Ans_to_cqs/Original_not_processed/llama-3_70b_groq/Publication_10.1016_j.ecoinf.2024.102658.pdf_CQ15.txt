Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing traditional machine learning methods, specifically logistic regression and random forest, and Bayesian generalized additive models (GAM). It mentions feature selection and cross-validation, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques specific to deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
