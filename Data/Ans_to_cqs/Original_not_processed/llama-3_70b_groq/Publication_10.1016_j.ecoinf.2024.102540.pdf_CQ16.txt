The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions the hyperparameters used for training, including the number of epochs and batch size, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
