Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is binary classification, specifically for image segmentation. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the study can be categorized as a binary classification and that the model is trained with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which is commonly used in supervised deep learning for binary classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions image segmentation, saliency maps, and pixel coordinates, which further supports the idea that the model is designed for image segmentation.
