Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction and its comparison with other variants, as well as the training and validation of the classifier model. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
