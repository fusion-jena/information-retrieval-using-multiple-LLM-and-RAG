Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in bird species recognition, specifically in birdsong recognition, and discusses various techniques used in feature extraction and classification.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a dropout layer in the network architecture, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This can be seen as a way to handle randomness in the model, but it is not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline due to random seed values.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, and ensuring reproducibility of experiments. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
