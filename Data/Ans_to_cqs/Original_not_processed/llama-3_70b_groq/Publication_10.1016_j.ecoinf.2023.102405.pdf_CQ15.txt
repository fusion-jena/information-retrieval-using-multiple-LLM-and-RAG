Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the AODEGRU model and its training process, but it does not specify the optimizer used. 

However, it is common in deep learning to use optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSProp, or Adagrad. Without further information, it is impossible to determine which optimizer is used in this specific pipeline.
