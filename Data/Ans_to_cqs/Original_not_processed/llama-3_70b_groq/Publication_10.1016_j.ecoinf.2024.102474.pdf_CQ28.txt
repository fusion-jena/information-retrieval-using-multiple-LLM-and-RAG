Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the deep learning framework used, which is PyTorch Lightning, built on top of PyTorch. It also mentions the hyperparameter optimization procedure using Optuna, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
