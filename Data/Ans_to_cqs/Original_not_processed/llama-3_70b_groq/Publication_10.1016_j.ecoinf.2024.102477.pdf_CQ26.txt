Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly SLSTM and SGRU models, for time-series prediction and forecasting. It discusses the advantages of deep learning methods, their ability to learn from complex data, and their performance in various domains. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
