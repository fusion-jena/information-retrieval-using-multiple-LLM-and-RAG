Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses early stopping, a technique to prevent overfitting, and presents the results of variable importance analysis for different machine learning models (ANN, Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree) used for predicting CLCuD. It also mentions the comparison of these models for prediction accuracy, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
