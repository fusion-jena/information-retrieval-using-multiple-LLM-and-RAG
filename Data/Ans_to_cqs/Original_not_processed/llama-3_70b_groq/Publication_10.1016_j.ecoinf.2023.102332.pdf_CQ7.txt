Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the creation of a word2vec space, the extraction of unigrams from text data, and the use of pre-trained models, but it does not provide information on data splitting for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
