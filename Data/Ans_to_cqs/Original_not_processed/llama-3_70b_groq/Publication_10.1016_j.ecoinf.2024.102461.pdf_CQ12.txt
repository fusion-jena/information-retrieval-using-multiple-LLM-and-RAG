Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
