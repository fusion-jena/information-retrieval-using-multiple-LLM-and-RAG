Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image classification and segmentation tasks, specifically using satellite images. The training data is generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size, and the batches consist of sub-images of size 256 × 256 that are randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. The corresponding batches of mask data have shape (20, 256, 256, 1).

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically 3-channel RGB images with a size of 256 × 256 pixels. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
