Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and machine learning applications, with discussions on neural networks, deep learning, and parameter tuning for models. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
