Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from public datasets and observations. Specifically, the context mentions GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) observations from 2002 to 2017, which were used to obtain SMS (Soil Moisture Storage) data. Additionally, GRACE-derived TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage) data is also used in the study. 

Furthermore, the context provides a table (Table 1) that summarizes various datasets used in the study, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, and others. These datasets are likely publicly available and were utilized in the study.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used to collect raw data in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that public datasets and observations are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
