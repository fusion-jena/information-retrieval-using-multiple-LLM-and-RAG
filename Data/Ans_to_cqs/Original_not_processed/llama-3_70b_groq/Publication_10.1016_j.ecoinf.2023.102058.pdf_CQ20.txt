Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
