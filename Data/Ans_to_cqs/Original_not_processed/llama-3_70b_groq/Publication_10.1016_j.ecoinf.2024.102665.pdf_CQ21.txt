Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the application of Bayesian networks to explore coral reef communities in Puerto Rico, and it discusses the use of Bayesian networks, cluster analysis, and other techniques for data analysis. 

However, it does mention some steps involved in the analysis, such as the maximization step that uses imputations to realign conditional probabilities in the network, and the use of multiple clustering to construct a new latent factor variable for each taxon. Additionally, it mentions the creation of a higher-level latent factor variable, a meta-cluster, that summarizes the cluster states across taxa.

But, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
