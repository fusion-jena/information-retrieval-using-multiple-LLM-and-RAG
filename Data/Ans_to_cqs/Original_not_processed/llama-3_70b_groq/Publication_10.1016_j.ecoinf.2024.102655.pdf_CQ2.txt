Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is related to water quality parameters, and the units of measurement are provided in mg/L, μS/cm, MPN/100 mL, ◦, etc. This suggests that the data is likely in a tabular format, such as CSV, containing numerical values for various water quality parameters. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
