Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. The context primarily focuses on various topics such as event-stream processing, machine learning, computer vision, and biology, but it does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "speed and accuracy" in the title of a paper by Kovalev et al. (2016), which suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions "estimating the active space of a signal" in the paper by Lohr et al. (2003), which might be related to evaluating the performance of a model, but it is not clear what specific metrics are used.

In general, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and others, depending on the specific problem and task. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which metrics are used in the context of the provided papers.
