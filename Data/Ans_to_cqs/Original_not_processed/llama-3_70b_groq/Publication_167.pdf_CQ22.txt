Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the training process, the use of the Adam optimization algorithm, and the 10-fold cross-validation method, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
