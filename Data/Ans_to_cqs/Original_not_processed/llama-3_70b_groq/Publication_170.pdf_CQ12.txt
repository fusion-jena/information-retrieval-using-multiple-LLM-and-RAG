Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the AlexNet model. This is stated in the context as "The DCNN model of our study was the AlexNet model, which included five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers (Krizhevsky et al. 2012)".
