Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses machine learning models, particularly random forest methods, and their training methodology.

However, it does mention a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach for machine learning model development. This approach involves an outer 10 k-fold cross-validation that divides the data into holdout data and data for model development. An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation is then used to minimize the bias caused by tuning hyperparameters on training results.

While this does not directly answer the query about deep learning model training, it suggests that the data is split into training and holdout sets, with the training set further divided into folds for cross-validation. However, the exact criteria used for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning models are not specified in the provided context.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it is unclear what criteria are used to split the data for deep learning model training.
