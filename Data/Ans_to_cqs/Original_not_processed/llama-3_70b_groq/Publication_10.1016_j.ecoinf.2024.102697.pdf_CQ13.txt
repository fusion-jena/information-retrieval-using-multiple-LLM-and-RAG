Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a random forest model, which is a type of machine learning model. Therefore, it does not provide information about hyperparameters typically used in deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development, but it does not specify the hyperparameters that were optimized.
