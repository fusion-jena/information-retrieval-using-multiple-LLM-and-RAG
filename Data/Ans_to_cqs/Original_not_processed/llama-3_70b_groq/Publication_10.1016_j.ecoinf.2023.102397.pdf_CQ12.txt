Answer:::
Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, and that increasing the number of hidden layers can improve the performance of the model. This suggests that the model might be a deep neural network, but the specific type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified.
