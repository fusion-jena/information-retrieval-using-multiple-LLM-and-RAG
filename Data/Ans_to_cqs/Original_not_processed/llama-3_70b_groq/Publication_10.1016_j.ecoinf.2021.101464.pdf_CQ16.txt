Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in terms of validation loss plateau. However, there are some hints that suggest the criteria used.

In the context, it is mentioned that the intermediate prediction model needed to fulfill the criteria P value <0.01. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on the P value, and training is considered complete when the P value reaches a certain threshold.

Additionally, the context mentions that the correlation coefficients between the observed values and the estimated values in the validation samples were calculated. This implies that the model's performance is also evaluated based on the correlation coefficient, and training may be considered complete when the correlation coefficient reaches a certain level of significance.

In the case of the Random Forest model, the context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated based on the proportion of explained variance, RMSE, and R2 values. The model's stability is also verified using 10-fold cross-validation. However, there is no explicit mention of a validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining when training is complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are based on statistical measures such as P value, correlation coefficient, proportion of explained variance, RMSE, and R2 values, rather than a validation loss plateau.
