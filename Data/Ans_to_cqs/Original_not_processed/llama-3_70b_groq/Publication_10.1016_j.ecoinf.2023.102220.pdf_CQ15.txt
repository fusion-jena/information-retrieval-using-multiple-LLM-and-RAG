Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. It only mentions the use of TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries in Python for implementing the classification methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train these models.
