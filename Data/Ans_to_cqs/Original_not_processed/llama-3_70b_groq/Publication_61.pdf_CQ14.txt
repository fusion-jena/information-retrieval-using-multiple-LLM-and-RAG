Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameters were set empirically, and the specific values used are provided in the experiments section (learning rate 0.01, number of epochs 150, batch size 2500). There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, it is unclear how the hyperparameters were optimized.
