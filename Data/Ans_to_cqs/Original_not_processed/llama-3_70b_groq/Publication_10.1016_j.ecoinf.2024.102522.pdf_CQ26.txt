Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and provides information on variable classification, bioclimate, biological factors, geographical environment factors, and human spread factors. It also includes tables showing the classification of a model and variables in the model, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
