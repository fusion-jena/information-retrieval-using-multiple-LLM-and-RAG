Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the overall structure of the proposed system, the components of the LSTM model, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
