Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "All pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs..." This suggests that the training is complete after a fixed number of epochs (1000 in this case), rather than based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau.
