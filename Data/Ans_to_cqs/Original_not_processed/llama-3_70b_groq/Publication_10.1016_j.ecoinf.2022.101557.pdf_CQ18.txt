Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a validation set is used, which is randomly selected from all areas used in the training set and is never used to fit the model. This implies that the model's performance is being monitored on this validation set during training, but the specific metrics or strategy used to do so are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of cross-entropy loss as the objective function to be minimized, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance is being monitored or evaluated during training.
