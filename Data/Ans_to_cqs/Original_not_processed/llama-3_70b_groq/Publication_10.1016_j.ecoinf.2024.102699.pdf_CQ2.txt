Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on audio classification, specifically for classifying birdsong within natural soundscapes. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. 

The context mentions the use of various data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which suggests that the input data is in an audio format. Additionally, the mention of spectrograms and frequency domain augmentation techniques further supports the idea that the input data is audio-based.

Therefore, the answer is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio.
