Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps, including audio standardization, segmentation, augmentation, and spectrogram conversion, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
