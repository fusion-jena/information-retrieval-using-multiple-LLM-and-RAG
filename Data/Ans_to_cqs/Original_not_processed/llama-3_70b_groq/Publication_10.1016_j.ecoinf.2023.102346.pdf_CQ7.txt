Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses model selection, ensemble modeling approach, and statistical analysis in the context of habitat suitability prediction and species distribution modeling. It mentions the use of various machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics such as AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, this information is not provided in the given context.
