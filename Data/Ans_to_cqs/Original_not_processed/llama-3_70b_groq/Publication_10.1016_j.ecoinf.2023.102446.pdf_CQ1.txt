Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "flux tower data" which suggests that sensors might be used for data collection. Flux towers are instruments used to measure the exchange of energy and matter between the atmosphere and the land surface, so it is likely that sensors on these towers are used to collect data on carbon sources and sinks.

No other information is provided about surveys or public datasets being used for data collection. Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors, specifically those on flux towers, are used for data collection, but the context does not provide information on other methods that might be used in a deep learning pipeline.
