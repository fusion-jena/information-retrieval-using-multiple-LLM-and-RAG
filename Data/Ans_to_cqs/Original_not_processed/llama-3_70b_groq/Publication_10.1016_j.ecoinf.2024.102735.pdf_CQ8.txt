Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The references cited are academic papers and do not provide any information about code repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
