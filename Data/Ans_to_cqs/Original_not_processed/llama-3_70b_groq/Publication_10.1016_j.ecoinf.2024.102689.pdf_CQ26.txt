Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning models and techniques used for fish length and catch number monitoring, precision aquaculture, and fish individual recognition. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, YOLO models, FaceNet, and knowledge distillation methods for model compression. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
