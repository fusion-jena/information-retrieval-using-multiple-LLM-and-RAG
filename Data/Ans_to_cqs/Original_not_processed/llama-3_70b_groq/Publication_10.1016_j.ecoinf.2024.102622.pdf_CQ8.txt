Answer: I don't know.

The provided context consists of a list of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and machine learning. However, there is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context does not provide any information about the availability of code or its hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
