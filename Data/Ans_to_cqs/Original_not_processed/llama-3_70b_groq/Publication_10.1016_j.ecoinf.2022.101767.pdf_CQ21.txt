Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing a study on YouTube videos about wild birds, where the researchers extracted videos using a specific keyword, identified bird species, and analyzed factors that affect the number of views for each video. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is typically where postprocessing steps like those mentioned in the query would be relevant.
