Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of five network models, including Inceptionv3 and ResNet, and their performance in landscape type classification. It also explains the stages of the classification process based on deep learning, including data preparation, model selection, and model evaluation. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
