Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of AlexNet and GoogLeNet, which are both well-known CNN architectures. The paper also mentions the use of a softmax layer and fully connected layers, which are typical components of CNNs. Additionally, the paper cites Simonyan and Zisserman's work on very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, further supporting the use of CNNs in the pipeline.
