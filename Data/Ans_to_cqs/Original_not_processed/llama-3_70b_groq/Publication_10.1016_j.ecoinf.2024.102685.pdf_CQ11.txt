Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, statistical analysis, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The references cited are academic papers and do not include links to data repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
