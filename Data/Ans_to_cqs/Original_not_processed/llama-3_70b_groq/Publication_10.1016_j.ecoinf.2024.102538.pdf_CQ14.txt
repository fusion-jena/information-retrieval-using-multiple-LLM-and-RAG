Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the values of the hyperparameters used in the model, such as the learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and others. It does not provide information on the optimization method used to determine these values, such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
