Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context primarily focuses on the analysis of machine learning models for river health index (RHI) prediction and their generalizability through bias-variance decomposition. It discusses various machine learning models, including deep learning models, but does not provide information on the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
