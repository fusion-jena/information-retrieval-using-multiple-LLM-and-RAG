Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The text appears to be discussing a process network approach using TPINet to identify causal links between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem, and it provides information about data collection, processing, and analysis. There is no mention of a model or its training process, so it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
