Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the experimental configurations, measurement of performance, and architecture of the model, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
