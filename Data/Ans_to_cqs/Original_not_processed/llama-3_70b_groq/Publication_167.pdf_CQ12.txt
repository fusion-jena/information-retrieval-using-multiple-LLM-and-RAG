Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is also known as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is mentioned in Figure 4, which describes the Deep Learning Module, and further explained in the text accompanying Figure 5. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
