Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text focuses on the application of the BirdNET deep learning model for bird species monitoring and analysis, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during the model's training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
