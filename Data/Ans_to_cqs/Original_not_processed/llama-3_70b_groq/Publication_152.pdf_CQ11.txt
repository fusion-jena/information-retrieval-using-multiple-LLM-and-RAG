Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net for image classification and segmentation, as well as data augmentation techniques, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
