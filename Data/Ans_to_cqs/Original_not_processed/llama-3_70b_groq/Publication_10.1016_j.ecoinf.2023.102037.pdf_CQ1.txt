Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using automatic imaging traps and wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses. These devices capture images of pests, which are then used to train and test the deep learning models.

Specifically, the "Pest24" dataset used in Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) consists of 25,378 annotated images collected by an automatic imaging trap. Similarly, Rustia et al. (2021) acquired data using multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting environments.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in other deep learning pipelines or applications.

It is worth noting that the provided context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, this answer is limited to the specific context provided and may not be generalizable to other scenarios.
