Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was tested under very difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds, which might have helped in improving its generalizability. Additionally, the model was trained on a relatively small dataset, which is a common challenge in deep learning. The use of the Adam optimizer, which is known to perform well on small datasets, might have also contributed to the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. The model was trained and evaluated on a single dataset, and the validation metrics were calculated on a fixed set of 321 image tiles. Therefore, it is unclear how well the model would generalize to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the model was tested on complex backgrounds and used an optimizer suitable for small datasets, the context does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
