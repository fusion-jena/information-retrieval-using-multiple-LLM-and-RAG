Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction in herbarium sheets. It discusses the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset are used to initialize the model weights, and fine-tuned during training. However, it does not mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
