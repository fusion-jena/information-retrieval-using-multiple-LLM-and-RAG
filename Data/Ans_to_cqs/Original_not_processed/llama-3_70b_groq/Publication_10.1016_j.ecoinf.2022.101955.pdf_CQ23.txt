Answer: 

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It discusses the use of four machine learning (ML) algorithms: random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). 

However, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only mentions that the RF model was allowed to set the number of trees and number of features in each split by default to ensure satisfactory model performance. It also mentions the use of the "Control()" function to evaluate tuning parameters for model performance, but it does not provide further details on this function.
