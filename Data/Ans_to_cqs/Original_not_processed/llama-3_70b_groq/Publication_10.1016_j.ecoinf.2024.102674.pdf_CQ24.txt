Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in deep learning. The context appears to be related to statistical modeling and geospatial analysis, discussing various algorithms such as generalized additive models, artificial neural networks, random forests, and generalized boosting regression models. It also mentions the use of physiographic descriptors and digital terrain models to analyze climatic conditions. However, there is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines.
