Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, such as random forest and support vector regression, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of harmful algal blooms. It discusses the importance of dataset size, kernel functions, and other hyperparameters in improving model performance, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
