Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are early stopping and a simpler architecture. The text states, "early stopping was used to prevent overfitting" and also mentions that a simpler architecture was used instead of pre-training on ResNet50 and Inception neural networks, which suggests that the simpler architecture is also a regularization method to prevent overfitting. 

However, it does not mention other common regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or batch normalization. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these methods were used in this specific pipeline.
