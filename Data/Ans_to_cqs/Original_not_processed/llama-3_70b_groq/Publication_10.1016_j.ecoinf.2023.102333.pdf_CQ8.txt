Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models for land-use and land-cover classification, optimization algorithms, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
