Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only mentions that the SPOT6 satellite data for the five study areas were preprocessed to be fed into the different Deep Learning architectures and the XGBoost model, but it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps taken.

However, it is mentioned that the data were split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. This suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing may have taken place, but the exact steps are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
