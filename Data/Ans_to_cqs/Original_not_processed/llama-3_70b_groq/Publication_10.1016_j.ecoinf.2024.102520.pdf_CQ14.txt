Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of geostatistical analysis, kriging interpolation, and semivariograms, but it does not provide information on the optimization of model hyperparameters. The context only presents the results of the analysis, including the R2 and RMSE values of different models, but it does not explain how the hyperparameters of these models were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
