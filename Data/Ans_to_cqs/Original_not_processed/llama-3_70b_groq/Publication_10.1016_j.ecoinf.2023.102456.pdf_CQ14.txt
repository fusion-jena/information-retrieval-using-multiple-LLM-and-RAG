Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various topics such as the Gumbel-Softmax function, its applications, and its limitations, as well as cellular automata and forest fire detection. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
