Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CA-Hybrid network, its performance, and comparison with other models. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
