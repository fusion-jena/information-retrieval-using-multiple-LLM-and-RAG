Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, such as ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and XGBoost, in various fields like built environment research, sentiment analysis, and urban vitality studies. It also discusses the use of SHAP value analysis for interpretable results.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of integrating multi-source data for built environment studies, which could potentially help mitigate data bias issues. Additionally, the use of techniques like crowdsourcing (Wang et al., 2021) and leveraging social media data (Ma et al., 2021) could also contribute to more diverse and representative datasets.

In the absence of explicit information on data bias addressing techniques, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to the query.
