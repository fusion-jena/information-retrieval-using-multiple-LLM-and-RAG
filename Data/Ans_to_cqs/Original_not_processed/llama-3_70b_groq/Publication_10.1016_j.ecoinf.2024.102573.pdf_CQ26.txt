Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on audio frontend processing, compression, and normalization techniques, specifically in the context of species recognition from outdoor recordings. It discusses the use of learnable frontends, mel-filterbanks, Gaussian pooling, log compression, and PCEN (Per-Channel Energy Normalization) for noise tolerance and whitening the data. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
