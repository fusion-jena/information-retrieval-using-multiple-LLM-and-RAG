Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. This is mentioned in section 3.1. Model evaluation and selection, where it is stated that "longer model training past 1000 iterations tended to give higher recall but lower precision." This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated based on its ability to balance precision and recall.
