Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 
The learning rate is set to 0.001, momentum to 0.9, and weight decay to 0.0005. 
The optimizer used is the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate algorithm. 
The batch size is set to 4 due to limitations in computer memory. 
The model is trained for a total of 350 epochs.
