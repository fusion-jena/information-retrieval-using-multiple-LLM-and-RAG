Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on explaining the concepts of pooling layers, convolution, and their applications. It does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or any other methods to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
