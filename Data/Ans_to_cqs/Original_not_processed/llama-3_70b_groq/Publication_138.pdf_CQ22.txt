Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are calculated using the following formulas:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) * 100%
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) * 100%
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) * 100%
F1 score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) * 100%

where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
