Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context explains the training process, including the use of mini-batches, epochs, and loss scores, but it does not specify the conditions under which training is considered complete. 

It is possible that the criteria for determining the completion of training may include validation loss plateau, as mentioned in the query, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Other possible criteria, such as reaching a certain level of accuracy or completing a fixed number of epochs, are also not mentioned. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
