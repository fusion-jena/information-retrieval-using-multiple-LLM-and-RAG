Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. This is mentioned in the sentence: "We used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0005 and trained the geographic prior on 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 â€“ obtained via preliminary experimentation." There is no mention of other optimization techniques such as SGD in the provided context.
