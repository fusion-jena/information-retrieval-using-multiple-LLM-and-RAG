Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions "CNN used in the study" and "deep-learning CNN architectures" were tested. Additionally, the context describes the architecture of the CNN, including the use of convolution layers, dense layers, and residual connections, which are all characteristic components of a CNN.
