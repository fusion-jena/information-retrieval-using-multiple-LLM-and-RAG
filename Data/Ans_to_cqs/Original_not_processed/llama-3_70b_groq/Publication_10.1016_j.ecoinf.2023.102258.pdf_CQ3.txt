Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that "temporally-precise and fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly and time-consuming." It also mentions that some systems use explicit methods to control the duration of the detected events, such as post-processing predictions to delete/merge very short events or estimating the typical duration from the examples.

However, it does mention that some approaches use neural network architectures specifically trained to infer and output region annotations, as seen in Du_NERCSLIP(23) and Wolters et al. (2021). This suggests that region annotation might be one of the annotation techniques used, but it is not explicitly stated.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
