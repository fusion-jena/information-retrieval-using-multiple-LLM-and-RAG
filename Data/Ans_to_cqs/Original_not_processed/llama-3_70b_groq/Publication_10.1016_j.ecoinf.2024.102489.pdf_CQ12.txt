Answer: 
The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The model mentioned is a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm based on decision trees, not a deep learning model. It is used for regression and classification tasks and is known for its interpretability, tolerance for noisy datasets, and ability to handle high-dimensional datasets. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, Transformer, or any other deep learning models in the provided context.
