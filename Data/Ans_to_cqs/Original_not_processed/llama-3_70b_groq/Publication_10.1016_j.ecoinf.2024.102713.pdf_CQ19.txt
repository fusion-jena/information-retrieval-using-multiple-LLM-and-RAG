Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be discussing a database schema and data platform components, including data sources, integration, and analytical fruition. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, and therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build such a model.
