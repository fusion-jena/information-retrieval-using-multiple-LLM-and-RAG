Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and vegetation cover studies, and it provides information on various methods and techniques used for NDVI reconstruction, including harmonic analysis and deep-learning enhanced fusion methods. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
