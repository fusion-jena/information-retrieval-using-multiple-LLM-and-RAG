Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research article about classifying animal population time series data using feature-based and shape-match methods. The context mentions the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks' reports on wildlife harvest summaries, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
