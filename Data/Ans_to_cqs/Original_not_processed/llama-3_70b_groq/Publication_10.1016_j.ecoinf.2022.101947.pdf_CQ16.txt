Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the validation of the algorithm using holdback trials to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing and determining the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algorithm training set and test sets. It discusses the robustness of the model and the variation in sequential trials, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
