Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on the application of TensorFlow for automated Chagas disease vector identification and discusses the adjustment of two parameters (validation percentage and number of training steps) but does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
