Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation metrics (F1-score, precision, and recall) used to assess the model's performance. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the F1-score, precision, and recall are mentioned as evaluation metrics. Additionally, the context does not provide any information about saliency maps or confusion matrices being used as postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and it is unclear what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
