Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is using TensorBoard. According to the context, "During the monitoring of the training of the neural network using TensorBoard [30], it was noticed that the validation loss was consistently lower than the training loss before the overfitting point, as shown in Figure 5." This indicates that TensorBoard was used to monitor the training process and track the performance of the model.
