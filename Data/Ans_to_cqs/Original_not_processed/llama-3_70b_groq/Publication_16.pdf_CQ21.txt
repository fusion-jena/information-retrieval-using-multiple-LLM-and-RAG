Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the predicted vector is processed and logged to the site for review. Additionally, Table 1 shows the performance metrics obtained using the test data, including Sensitivity and Specificity for each species. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed, but the exact steps are not detailed.

It is also worth noting that Figure 10 shows the train and validation accuracy during the training session, and Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the test and validation data during model training. This implies that some form of evaluation or validation is performed during the training process, but again, the exact postprocessing steps are not specified.

In summary, while some form of metrics calculation and evaluation is implied, the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
