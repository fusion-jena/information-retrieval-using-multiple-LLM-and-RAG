Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the modeling procedure, bias-variance decomposition, and model interpretation. It discusses the training of 11 machine learning models, hyperparameter optimization using TPE algorithms, and the calculation of average loss, average bias, and average variance for each model. 

However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. These steps are typically used to evaluate and visualize the performance of the trained models, but they are not mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided information.
