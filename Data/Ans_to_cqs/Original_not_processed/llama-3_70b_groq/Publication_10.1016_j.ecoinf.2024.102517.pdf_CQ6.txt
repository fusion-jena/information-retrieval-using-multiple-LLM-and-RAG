Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the architecture of the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network. 

However, it can be inferred that batch normalization was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by Chen et al. (2017) in the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network. This suggests that some form of normalization was involved, but the exact preprocessing steps are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is unclear what specific preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning model.
