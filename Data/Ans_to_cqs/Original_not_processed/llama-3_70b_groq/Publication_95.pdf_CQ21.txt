Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training procedure, model architecture, and experimental setup for the ResNet50V2 and YOLOv3 models. It discusses the training procedure, image sizes, and annotation sizes, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
