Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a study on pollination models, land use/land cover maps, and fuzzy logic systems. It discusses the use of Matlab 2023b for implementing fuzzy logic models, but it does not mention deep learning or any related hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
