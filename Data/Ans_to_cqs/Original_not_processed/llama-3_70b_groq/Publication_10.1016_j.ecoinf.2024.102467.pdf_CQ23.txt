Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and studies, but it does not provide specific information about the methods used to ensure generalizability.

However, some of the papers mentioned do discuss model evaluation and validation techniques, such as cross-validation, but it is not clear if these techniques were used to ensure generalizability specifically.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
