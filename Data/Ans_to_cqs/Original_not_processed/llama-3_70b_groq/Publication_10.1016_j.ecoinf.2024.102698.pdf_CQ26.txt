Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on synthetic data generation, machine learning methods, and their applications in ecological modeling. It discusses the use of classical and deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), for generating synthetic data. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
