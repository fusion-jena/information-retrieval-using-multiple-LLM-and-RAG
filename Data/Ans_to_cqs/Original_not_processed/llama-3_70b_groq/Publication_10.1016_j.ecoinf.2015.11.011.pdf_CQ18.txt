Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the use of eCognition for segmentation and classification, the development of new methods for automatically selecting segmentation parameters, and the use of machine learning techniques for image classification. It also describes the accuracy assessment process, which involves visually assessing the class of randomly selected points using ArcGIS's random point generating utility. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
