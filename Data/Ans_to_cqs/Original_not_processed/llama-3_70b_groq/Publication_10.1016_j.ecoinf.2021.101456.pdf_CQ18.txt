Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the formulation of control mechanisms, the influence of β and γ parameters, performance comparison, and selection of the number of clusters. It discusses the model's behavior and performance but does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
