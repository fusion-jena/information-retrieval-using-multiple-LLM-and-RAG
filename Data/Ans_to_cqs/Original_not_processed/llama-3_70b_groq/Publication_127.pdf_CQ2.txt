Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the mention of "camera-trap images" and references to image recognition papers such as Simonyan and Zisserman (2014) and Szegedy et al. (2015). Additionally, the context mentions "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database" (Deng et al., 2009), which further supports the use of image data.

There is also a mention of speech recognition, which suggests that audio data may be used in the pipeline. This is supported by references to papers such as Graves et al. (2013) and Bahdanau et al. (2016).

However, there is no explicit mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot confirm their use.

In summary, based on the provided context, it appears that image and audio data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline, but I cannot confirm the use of video or CSV data formats.
