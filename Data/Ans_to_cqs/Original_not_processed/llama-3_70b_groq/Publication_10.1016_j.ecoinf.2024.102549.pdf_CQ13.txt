Answer::: 

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Learning rate: The initial learning rate is 10, and it is halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance.
* Optimizer: The optimizer used is momentum with a value of 0.9.
* Kernel size: The kernel size is 3.
* Stride: The stride is 1.
* Dropout rate: The dropout rate is 50% post the fully connected layer.
* Number of epochs: The training is conducted over 500 epochs.

These hyperparameters are used in the CNN structure, which comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and three fully connected layers.
