Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecosystem services, food supply and demand, and environmental sustainability, but it does not provide information about deep learning optimization techniques. The mention of "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm" in the first line of the context is too vague to infer specific optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
