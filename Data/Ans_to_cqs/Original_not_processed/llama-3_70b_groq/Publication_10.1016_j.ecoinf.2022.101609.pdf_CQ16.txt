Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some information from the context. 

In Fig. 12, the model training and validation losses are plotted against the number of epochs. The training loss gradually decreases as the number of epochs increases, while the validation loss takes a slightly different pattern, dropping significantly after 2500 epochs and becoming steady for the remaining training epochs. 

Although it is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the training is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or becomes steady, indicating that the model has converged. This is a common criterion used in machine learning to determine when to stop training, as further training may lead to overfitting. 

However, it is important to note that the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
