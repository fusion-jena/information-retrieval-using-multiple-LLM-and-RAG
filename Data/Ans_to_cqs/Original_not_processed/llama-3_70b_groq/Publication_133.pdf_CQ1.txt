Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data vary in format and reliability as they originate from multiple sources, such as:

* Long-term ecological monitoring
* Citizen science projects
* Museum catalogs

It can be inferred that these sources might involve methods such as surveys, observations, and potentially sensors, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the context mentions the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a source of data, which is a public dataset.

Therefore, while we can infer some possible methods, the exact methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
