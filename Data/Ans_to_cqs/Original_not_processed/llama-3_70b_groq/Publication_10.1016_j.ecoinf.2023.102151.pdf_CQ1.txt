Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention soil surveys as a means of gathering detailed soil information from a particular site. It also references various research efforts that utilize web-based technologies for monitoring purposes, which may involve collecting data through sensors or other means. Additionally, the context mentions the utilization of public datasets, such as Crop-CASMA, for obtaining soil moisture data.

While the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that surveys, sensors, and public datasets may be involved in the process. However, it does not provide specific information on the use of these methods in a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that surveys, sensors, and public datasets may be used for collecting raw data, but the specific methods used in a deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
