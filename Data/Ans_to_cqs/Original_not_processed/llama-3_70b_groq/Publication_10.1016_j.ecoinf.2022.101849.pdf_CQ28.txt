Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be focused on a research study related to weakly-supervised learning and regression problems in macroecology, specifically in the context of global vegetation modeling. There is no mention of model deployment or any cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
