Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions related to satellite image classification using deep learning approaches, but it does not include any specific details about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
