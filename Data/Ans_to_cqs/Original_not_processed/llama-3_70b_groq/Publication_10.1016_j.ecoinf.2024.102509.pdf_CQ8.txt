Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The references are related to various topics such as agroforestry, remote sensing, ecological informatics, conservation of wetlands, and mangrove ecosystems, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
