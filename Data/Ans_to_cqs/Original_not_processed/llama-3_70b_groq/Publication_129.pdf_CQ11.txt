Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are mostly academic papers and conference proceedings, which do not typically include links to data repositories. Additionally, the context does not mention any specific dataset or repository used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
