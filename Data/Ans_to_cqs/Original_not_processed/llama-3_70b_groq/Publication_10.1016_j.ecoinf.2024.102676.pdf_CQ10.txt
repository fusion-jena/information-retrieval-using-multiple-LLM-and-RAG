Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for footprint identification, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The declaration of competing generative AI in scientific writing mentions the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
