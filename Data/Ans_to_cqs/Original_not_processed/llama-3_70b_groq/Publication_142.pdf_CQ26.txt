Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest some alternative approaches to mitigate data bias. 

For instance, the context mentions that choosing alternative sources, changing the search terms used, or pre-filtering images can help address biases in the data. It also suggests collecting images from social media targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, such as specialist Facebook groups or 'subreddits', to reduce the bias towards images from formal gardens.

Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the steps required to ensure the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated data for any given research question. It provides an eight-point list of questions for researchers to ask themselves when using AI classifiers, including whether the spatial distribution of images fits their needs and whether they can filter images before classification.

While the context does not provide a comprehensive list of techniques to address data bias, it highlights the need for careful consideration of data sources and preprocessing steps to ensure the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated data.
