EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Googleâ€™s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

quirements are even larger when training with high-resolution images. 
BoTNet uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information and 
low-resolution  feature  maps  before  inputting  them  for  self-attention, 
thereby  avoiding  excessive  memory  and  computational  resource  con-
sumption. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the BoTNet.

demonstrate  the  value  of  deep-learning

For the object detection algorithm experiments in this study, specific 
format  image  annotation  files  were  required  for  training.  The  AUDD 
provides  annotation  files  in  the  MS-COCO  format  (Lin  et  al.,  2014), 
which must be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth 
bounding box annotation files. An underwater image enhancement al-
gorithm  based  on  color  balance  and  multi-input  fusion  was  used  to 
enhance  the  images  in  the  dataset,  making  them  closer  to  a  natural 
underwater scene. Commonly, there is a dearth or scarcity of agricul-
tural image datasets. To verify that the algorithms proposed in this study 
can  achieve  good  performance  with  small  sample  sizes,  2000  images 
were randomly selected from the AUDD dataset as the training set, 200 
images as the validation set, and 1626 images as the testing set, with a 
ratio of approximately 10:1:8. Among the randomly selected 2000 im-

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that specific format image annotation files were required for training the object detection algorithm experiments in this study. The AUDD provides annotation files in the MS-COCO format, which had to be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth bounding box annotation files. Therefore, one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects in images and labeling them accordingly. It is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location and class of objects within an image.

However, the context does not provide any information about other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation. Instance segmentation is another popular technique used in computer vision tasks, where the aim is to detect and delineate each distinct object of interest appearing in an image. Unlike semantic segmentation, which groups pixels belonging to the same class together, instance segmentation differentiates between individual instances of the same class.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm that bounding box annotation was used as a data annotation technique in the deep learning pipeline. Other techniques such as instance segmentation may have been used but cannot be confirmed without additional information.
