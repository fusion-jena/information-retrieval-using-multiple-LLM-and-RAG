2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

All possible variants of forest AGB models were developed whereby 
each forest plot was assigned either to the training or the validation set 
and the 5 best models were selected for each of the cases using leaf-on 
ALS data, using leaf-off ALS data, using various ALS cloud point den-
sities (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 points/m2), presence or absence of dead vegetation 
in field plot biomass estimates, and inclusion or non-inclusion of forest 
regeneration, as well as the four modelling methods (AdaBoost, RF, NET, 
Bayes) (Fig. 5). We had 640 models in total for further analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that tuning of the hyperparameters was performed on the training set for each split, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of performance metric or convergence criterion may have been used to optimize the hyperparameters and determine the completion of training. Additionally, the use of a training-and-test approach with stratified splitting implies that the performance of the trained models was evaluated on a separate test set after training. Without more explicit information, we can only infer that some combination of performance metrics and convergence criteria were likely used to determine when training was complete.
