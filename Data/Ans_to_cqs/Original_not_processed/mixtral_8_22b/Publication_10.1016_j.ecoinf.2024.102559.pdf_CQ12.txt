Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in their respective pipelines. However, some clues can be gathered from the context. For instance, Vali et al.'s paper discusses deep learning for land use and land cover classification using hyperspectral and multispectral Earth observation data. Given this focus, it is likely that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed due to their effectiveness in handling spatial data such as images or satellite imagery. Similarly, Hayes et al.'s work mentions high-resolution landcover classification using Random Forest, which suggests that tree-based models might have been utilized instead of traditional deep learning architectures like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding each paper's methodology, we cannot definitively state what types of deep learning models were used in these studies.
