index is an integer value ranging from 1 to k, which denotes the index of 
the chosen feature map. For instance, the resolutions of the five feature 
maps on the top of Fig. 8 are 256 × 320, 128 × 160, 64 × 80, 32 × 40, 
and  16  × 20  respectively,  and  their  indices  are  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5 
respectively. λ in Eq. (3) is a canonical adjustment parameter introduced 
in (Lin et al., 2016, 2018). When the square root of a RoI area is equal to 
or more than λ, it is regarded as a big object and assigned to the feature 
map with low spatial resolution. For example, the canonical pre-training 
size of the ImageNet Dataset is 224 pixels, therefore, most of the object 
detection models trained by the ImageNet dataset or true-color imagery 
usually set the value of λ to be 224. However, λ = 224 is not suitable for 
the detection of small objects in the UAV thermal images. λ is a empir-
ically determined threshold. Therefore, λ in this paper was set to be 320

in the training phase.

hard negative mining, which focuses on challenging negative examples 
during the training process. By selectively mining hard negative exam-
ples,  the  model  can  learn  to  better  distinguish  between  objects  and 
background regions, leading to improved overall performance.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the value of lambda (λ), which is a crucial hyperparameter, is empirically determined and set to be 320 during the training phase. This suggests that some form of experimentation or trial-and-error approach might have been used to find the optimal value of λ. Additionally, the concept of hard negative mining is mentioned, which involves focusing on challenging negative examples during the training process to improve the model's ability to distinguish between objects and background regions. While this technique could potentially help optimize certain aspects of the model, it does not directly address the optimization of specific hyperparameters like λ. In summary, based on the given context, there is no clear indication of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using techniques like grid search or random search.
