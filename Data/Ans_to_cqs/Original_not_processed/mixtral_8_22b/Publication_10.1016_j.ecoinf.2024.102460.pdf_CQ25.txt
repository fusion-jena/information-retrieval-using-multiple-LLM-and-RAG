4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers. 

4.4.1. MOP model

Spatial reconstruction and scenario simulation of historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change 
(LUCC) can help to reveal the historical background of land conversion and the spatial distribution of future land. 
Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in 
different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In 
this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning 
time  series  forecasting  model  (LSTM),  a  parallelized  urban  land  use  simulation  (PLUS)  model  and  a  fuzzy 
multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land 
expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established:

The cellular automata (CA) model has received widespread attention 
for its effectiveness in simulating land use expansion (Deep and Saklani, 
2014). The CA model and the Markov chain prediction model (Markov- 
CA) can be used to forecast land conversion under different scenarios 
(Deep  and  Saklani,  2014;  Ghosh  et  al.,  2017).  In  addition,  the  paral-
lelized  urban land  use simulation (PLUS) model,  which combines  the 
Markov-CA  model  and  the  random  forest  classifier  (RFC)  forecasting 
method, has been widely applied (Liang et al., 2021; Nie et al., 2023). 
The  PLUS  model,  which  combines  spatial  econometrics  and  environ-
mental science, provides an excellent data mining framework and land 
evolution  mechanism  and  can  predict  land  conversion  trends  more 
accurately  (Xu  et  al.,  2023a).  However,  as  the  PLUS  model  uses  the 
Markov chain prediction model to infer future land use conversion, it

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the information available, we can infer that the deep learning model referred to here is likely being used for time series forecasting or prediction. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to address the prediction problem of time series data, particularly those involving long-term dependencies and multivariate time series data. This model is compared with other models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. Therefore, the primary purpose of this deep learning model appears to be predicting or forecasting time series data related to land use patterns and their associated ecosystem services.
