3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

• EfficientNetB0 EfficientNet is a CNN architecture and scaling method 
that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. EfficientNetB0 (Tan 
and Le, 2019) is a network that is trained on more than a million 
images from the ImageNet database.  

• EfficientNetB3 

EfficientNetB3 (Tan and Le, 2019) is another network of the Effi-
cientNet  family.  EfficientNetB3  comes  from  scaling  EfficientNetB0 
which was generated using AutoML.  

• InceptionResNetv2 

InceptionResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) is a CNN network that 
builds on the inception family of architectures. However, the model 
incorporates residual connections instead of the filter concatenation 
stage of the inception family.  

• ResNet50v2 

(Gomez et al., 2017) ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture that 
is  50  layers  deep.  ResNet50v2  is  also  trained  on  a  million  images 
from the ImageNet dataset.

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine what optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others have been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
