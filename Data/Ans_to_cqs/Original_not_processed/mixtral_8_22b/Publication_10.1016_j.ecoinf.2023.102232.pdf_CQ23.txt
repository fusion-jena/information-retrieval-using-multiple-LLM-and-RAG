The hybrid MCMC algorithm provides a series of independent chains 
containing a trace of values for each parameter to estimate. The traces 
corresponding to each chain are stored in specific text files and can be 
further analysed to obtain the final parameter values, their distribution, 
and  their  associated  uncertainty.  The  key  point  of  this  phase  of  the 
process is to evaluate if each chain provides a set of “best” values that are 
“suitable” to represent, once inserted into the model, the field dataset. In 
case different chains lead to a set of best-fitting parameters that faith-
fully represent the field data, the corresponding traces can be merged to 
obtain the final value as the mean of their values and the uncertainty as 
the standard deviation.

From each combination of values belonging to the first quarter of 
values stored in the Python dictionary, the GA generates four random 
combinations of initial values considered as input for the LS procedure 
previously described. Each best fit value stored in a single row of the 
dictionary is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution, 
μ, while the associated variance is still considered as σ2  = (zμ)2. Each 
new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the 
genetic algorithm is again stored in the database together with all the 
previously estimated sets of values. 

At the end of a genetic algorithm cycle, the rows of the database are 
again ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual. The 
genetic algorithm can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for 
simplicity we considered a nGAC = 2, that leads to a total number of nTGA 
= 2nGAC+1 ⋅ nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

method  to  estimate  the  model  parameters  directly  from  field  data,  where  experimental  activities  are  less 
expensive and less time consuming. In this study we propose a combination of least squares methods via genetic 
algorithms to preliminary evaluate the best parameter values and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain 
their distribution. The algorithm has been tested in the special case of Drosophila suzukii, to quantify part of the 
parameters  of  an almost  validated model in  two  steps:  i) a first pseudo-validation  using perturbed  numerical 
solutions, and ii) a validation using real field data. The results highlighted the potentialities of the algorithm in 
estimating model parameters and opened several perspectives for further improvements from both the compu-
tational and experimental point of view.

The selection of the “best candidate” traces to merge is entrusted to a 
visual inspection of every single chain. A dedicated script selects sepa-
rately each chain contained in the final text file and absorbs the traces 
associated with each parameter to estimate. The best fit value of each 
parameter is obtained from the chain as a mean of the values contained. 
After  the set  of best  fit  values obtained  by  the single  chain under in-
spection is calculated, they are inserted into the model (5) and the so-
lution is graphically represented together with the experimental dataset. 
If the overlap between simulations and field data is correct after a visual 
inspection of the simulated and the real values, the chain is stored in a 
dedicated file, otherwise, the chain is deleted. After selecting the best 
representative traces from visual inspections, the statistical distributions 
of the selected traces were compared to ensure that they are similar (i.e.,
