Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  (RF;  Breiman 
(2001)) is the most commonly used algorithm (Stupariu et al., 2021). RF 
are  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART)  based  ensemble  ap-
proaches,  which  overcome  limitations  of  CARTs  such  as  model  over- 
fitting.  Additionally,  RF  can  handle  large  numbers  of  predictor  vari-
ables  without  being  affected  by  multicollinearity,  and  can  readily 
accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response 
variables  (Breiman,  2001;  Evans  and  Cushman,  2009;  Kumar  et  al., 
2021). Furthermore, by permutation of variables, RF provides accessible 
measures of variable importance (Cutler et al., 2007; Evans and Cush-
man, 2009).

To produce accurate SDMs, not just the effects of different algorithms 
should be investigated, but also the effects of resampling techniques on 
model's  training  data  (Efron,  1982;  Freedman,  1981).  Specifically, 
bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement) the training 
data  has  been  shown  to  increase  models'  precision  by  providing  a 
combination of models, which reduces stochastic errors in estimation (e. 
g., Vaughan and Ormerod (2005); Hefley et al. (2014); Xu and Goodacre 
(2018)).

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions bootstrapping, a common technique used in machine learning for sampling with replacement from the original dataset to create new datasets for training or testing purposes. This method helps reduce bias and variance in the model. Other popular methods include holdout cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and stratified sampling. These methods aim to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.
