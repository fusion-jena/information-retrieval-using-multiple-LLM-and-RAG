2.3.3. Experimental setting

The  audio  classification  loss  network  consists  of  convolutional 
layers, average pooling layers, and a logic classifier layer. Layers 1 to 13 
also include convolutional operations, batch normalization, and LReLU 
operations,  with  down-sampling  operations  performed  between  each 
layer  with  a  factor  of  2.  Layer  14  includes  convolutional  operations, 
normalization, and nonlinear operations, omitting the down-sampling 
operation.  Layers  15  and  16  are  the  average  pooling  and  the  logic 
classifier layers, respectively. 

The loss is calculated as the weighted L1 distance between the first 
and  second  groups  of  activation  features,  which  can  be  expressed  as 
follows (Germain et al., 2018):

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the initial value of the weight λm is set to 1, but after 10 training iterations, its relative value is adjusted based on the reciprocal of the set value. This suggests that the number of training iterations could be one criterion used to adjust certain parameters during the training process. In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other specified conditions. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used in this particular case.
