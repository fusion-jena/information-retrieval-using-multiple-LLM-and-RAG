1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover.

(structurally incomplete), the constraint may not be met, but errors are neither random deviations. Mixtures of these settings 
are possible, e.g., we may have structurally incomplete with missing labels, etc.

Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

by a random percentage.  

2.  Random reduction. We reduce each target in the composition by a 
random fraction. In this case, some targets can be reduced to 0.  
3.  Non-random (biased) reduction. We reduce targets randomly, as 
in the random reduction. However, only a few selected targets are 
being reduced. This  way, we imitate  the biased incompleteness of 
only some target labels. 

Then, we compare the mean absolute error (MAE) left in the data 
after we employ baseline approaches from Section 2.2 (taking no action 
and applying normalization) and partial imputation algorithm (Section 
2.3)  to  this  artificially  incomplete  data.  MAE  is  averaged  over  1000 
repetitions for each experiment. 

In the partial imputation algorithm, we use two types of clusters:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Instead, it discusses various methods of handling weakly labeled data in machine learning tasks, specifically focusing on a case study involving predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. The paper introduces a new computational setting called'structural incompleteness,' which deals with target labels that do not meet certain constraints. It also compares three methods of reducing target values to simulate artificial incompleteness: uniform reduction, random reduction, and non-random (biased) reduction. These methods aim to evaluate the performance of baseline approaches and a partial imputation algorithm when dealing with incomplete data.
