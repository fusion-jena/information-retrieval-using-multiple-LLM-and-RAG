4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

after the TIFS treatment, and the shrinkage rates of woodland, grassland 
and  water bodies  were reduced by 0.52%, 3.46%  and  3.76%, respec-
tively, compared to those in the EDP scenario; moreover, the expansion 
rate of built-up areas was reduced by 18.04% compared to that in the 
EDP scenario. At this point in the basin, the economic benefit, ESV and 
EC of the land system were 31,773.63, 5079.30 and 3563.04 (unit: 104 
CNY), respectively. In summary, future planning should focus on pro-
tecting  cropland  by  formulating  appropriate  policies  and  strictly 
adhering to protection strategies, coordinating the systematic manage-
ment  of  different  types  of  land,  improving  the  quality  of  vegetation 
cover  and  restoring  the  natural  ecological  environment.  On  the  one 
hand, there is an urgent need to improve the planning and construction 
of urban clusters to make efficient use of existing land in built-up areas

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses the application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network commonly used for processing sequential data like time series data. The LSTM model is known for its ability to handle long-term dependencies and multivariate time series data, making it suitable for solving prediction problems related to time series data. Additionally, the context mentions the comparison between the LSTM model and other models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. It also briefly touches upon optimizing land allocation using a Multiobjective Programming (MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods. Unfortunately, without further information regarding the specifics of the deep learning pipeline employed in this research, I cannot provide details about the data augmentation techniques used.
