The  training  set,  comprising  the  majority  of  the  data  (82%),  con-
taining 4000 images, is used to train the model and adjust its parame-
ters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in 
the data. The validation set (13%), consisting of 607 images, is utilized 
during  training  to  fine-tune  hyperparameters  and  assess  the  model's 
performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring 
generalization. Lastly, the testing set (5%), which included 260 images, 
serves  as  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  model's  performance  on 
completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world 
effectiveness and ability to generalize. 

2.3. Performance evaluation 

To evaluate the ablated model results, we use five metrics, namely 
Precision (Eq. (1)), Recall (Eq. (2)), mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, related to 
Eq. (3), Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms) and Time(h).

We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency. 
Models  with  more  parameters  generally  require  more  resources  for

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.

The  YOLOv8  algorithm  offers  a  range  of  network  structures, 
including  YOLOv8n,  YOLOv8s,  YOLOv8m,  YOLOv8l,  and  YOLOv8x. 
While they differ in width and depth, they follow the same principles 
and can be chosen according to specific needs. The deeper the structure, 
the higher the precision, but the slower the training and inference speed. 
YOLOv8n was chosen as the base structure to prioritize speed without 
compromising  accuracy,  with  further  enhancements  to  improve 
performance. 

Adding the P2 feature level to the YOLOv8 architecture makes the 
network  deeper  because  an  additional  layer  is  added  to  the  overall 
network structure. The YOLOv8 architecture already includes a series of 
convolutional  layers  and  a  neck  section  that  combines  features  from

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the dataset is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set comprises the majority of the data (82%) and contains 4000 images. This set is used to train the model and adjust its parameters, enabling it to learn from various examples and patterns within the data.

The validation set consists of 13% of the total data, or 607 images. During training, this set helps fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. Using a validation set prevents overfitting and ensures better generalization.

Lastly, the testing set accounts for 5% of the data, including 260 images. This set serves as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data, offering a reliable measure of its effectiveness and ability to generalize in real-world scenarios.

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include allocating most of the data for training purposes, reserving a smaller portion for validating the model during training, and using another small subset for final testing and evaluation.
