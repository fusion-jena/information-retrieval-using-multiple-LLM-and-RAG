reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

2.4. Modifying the landscape design 

This step aims to adjust the landscape design based on the assessment 
results. The restorative map helps better understand the design quality, 
enabling planners to grasp design strengths and weaknesses. Areas with 
high  scores  indicate  high  restorative  potential,  whereas  areas  of 
underperformance  with  low  scores  signify  zones  requiring  significant 
enhancement in restorative potential. Planners can improve their design 
further by addressing any weaknesses identified. The updated design is 
fed into previous steps for model development, point cloud generation 
and performance assessment. The iterative process continues until the 
high-performance design or desired objectives are achieved.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets such that each set maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire population.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of the classifier. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. However, this may result in loss of information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the entire population. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the classifier.

These techniques can be combined to further mitigate data bias. For example, stratified sampling can be applied before oversampling or undersampling to maintain the original class distribution. Additionally, diverse data collection can be used alongside these methods to create a more robust and accurate classifier.
