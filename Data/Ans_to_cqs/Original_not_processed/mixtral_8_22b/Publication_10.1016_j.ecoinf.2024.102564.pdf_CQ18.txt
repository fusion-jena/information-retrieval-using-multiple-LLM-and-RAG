Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses several machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.

Nevertheless, we can infer some general strategies based on common practices in machine learning. For instance, one common approach is to use cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into training and validation sets. During training, the model's performance is evaluated using the validation set after each epoch or iteration. This helps prevent overfitting and provides insights into how well the model is learning from the data.

Additionally, metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and bias are often used to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics provide quantitative measures of the accuracy and precision of the predictions made by the models.

Therefore, while the exact strategy employed in this particular study remains unclear, these general approaches could have been utilized to monitor the model performance during training.
