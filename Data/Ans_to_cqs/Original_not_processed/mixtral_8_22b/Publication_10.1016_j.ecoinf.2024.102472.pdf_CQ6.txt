During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

layers. ANNs require a substantial amount of training data to achieve 
effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN)  algorithms  simulate  human 
learning by establishing and strengthening connections between input 
and  output  data  (Campesato,  2020).  These  connections  enable  data 
linkage without the need for training data (Shen et al., 2021). Notable 
ANN algorithms include Radial Basis Function, Elman Recurrent, and 
Hopfield Neural Networks (Campesato, 2020; Domingues et al., 2020). 
However,  Multilayer  Perceptron  Neural  Networks  (MLPNNs)  using 
backpropagation  have  gained  popularity  and  were  employed  in  this 
study (Günlü and Ercanlı, 2020; Wang and Xing, 2008). MLPNNs consist 
of  input,  hidden,  and  output  layers,  each  with  interconnected  nodes 
(neurons) that transform input into output data (Wang et al., 2017). In 
this study, the input layer had 23 neurons, correlating with predictors. 
The  hidden  layer's  neuron  count  was  determined  using  training  and

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, some general preprocessing steps can be inferred based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning models.

Before training any deep learning model, including Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs) mentioned in the context, it is essential to prepare the dataset properly. Preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed. Some commonly applied preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset.

2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Transforming features so they fall within a similar range, which helps improve convergence during optimization. Common methods include Min-Max Normalization, Z-score Normalization, and Logarithmic Scaling.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for use in a deep learning model. Techniques like One-Hot encoding, Label encoding, or Binary encoding might be used.

4. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Training set is used to train the model, while validation set is utilized to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Testing set evaluates the final performance of the model.

In summary, although the context does not provide direct information regarding preprocessing steps, generally accepted best practices involve data cleaning, feature scaling/normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into appropriate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes.
