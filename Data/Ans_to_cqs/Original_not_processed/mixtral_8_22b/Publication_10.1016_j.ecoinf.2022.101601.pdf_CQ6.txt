Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or inconsistent values are removed or corrected. Normalization is another common step, which scales numeric features to a similar range so that no single feature dominates the others. Scaling involves transforming the input data into a standard format, such as converting categorical variables into numerical ones. Other techniques like dimensionality reduction, encoding, and augmentation might also be applied depending on the specific requirements of the problem being addressed.
