4.2. Downscaled forest biomass density 

4.2.1. Spatial distribution

1. Introduction

field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC); creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand which features contributed most to the predictions made by the model; and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. It is also important to validate the results obtained from the model using independent datasets to ensure its robustness and reliability.
