The MAE is used to evaluate the average magnitude of the errors
between the fused results and observed values, which is also referred to
as the L1 loss. The MAE has a range of [0, +∞], where a value closer to
0 indicates a closer match between the fused results and observed
values. The formula used is as follows:

MAE = 1

ERGAS calculates the quality of the fused image as the normalized
average error of the fused image bands, which can be used to assess the
accuracy of image reconstruction and the smoothness in preserving the
spatial resolution. The ERGAS ranges from 0 to infinity, with lower
values indicating a higher similarity between the two images. The
calculation formula is as follows:

ERGAS = 100

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for this purpose. However, these methods are commonly used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models. Grid search involves specifying a set of possible values for each parameter and then exhaustively trying all combinations of parameters within those sets. Random search, on the other hand, randomly samples points in the space defined by the possible values of each parameter. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors like computational resources available and the complexity of the model being trained. In any case, further details about the specific methodology used for hyperparameter optimization would need to be obtained directly from the source material or authors of the study.
