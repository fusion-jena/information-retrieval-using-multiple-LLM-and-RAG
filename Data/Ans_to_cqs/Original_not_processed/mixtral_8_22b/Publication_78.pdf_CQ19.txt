3.1. Explanation of Steps

Initially, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone. In the next step,
the image is segmentized and divided into small patches. Features are extracted from
each patch with the help of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. A visual vocabulary

(VV) is created, as shown in Figure 4, this visual vocabulary is the features extracted
from these features, and the training features are passed to classiﬁer i.e., SVM, which
classiﬁes whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral. We used different
handcrafted features as well as different D-CNN’s but AlexNet shows the highest accuracy.
We used different classiﬁers i.e., SVM, kNN, and decision tree, but SVM outperforms all
other classiﬁers.

3.2. Feature Extraction

3.2.3. Custom D-CNN: CoralNet

We create a custom D-CNN named as CoralNet for the extraction of the spatial features.
CoralNet has thirteen layers in which three layers are convolutional layers (Conv2D), two
max-pooling (MaxPooling2D) layers, two dense layers, one ﬂatten layer, three activation
layers. The input layer size is kept at 227 × 227 × 3. Two activation layers have rectiﬁed
linear unit (ReLU) as activation function while the last activation layer uses softmax as
activation function. Features are extracted with Conv2D layers and the feature vector is
extracted at the last layer. The training options used for training CoralNet are summarized
in Table 1. The simpliﬁed architecture of the CoralNet is shown in Figure 6.

3. Proposed Framework

The proposed BoF based framework is presented in Figure 2. Test images are captured
with underwater drones [29] then passed through the ground station for obtaining the
output. The model is trained with 15k images of bleached and unbleached corals of the
Great Barrier Coral Reef of Australia. The SVM classiﬁer is employed to categorize the
features extracted through D-CNN and handcrafted descriptors. The basic steps involved
in the proposed methodology are visually represented in Figure 3. Initially, a patch is
extracted from the coral reef image. In next step, the texture and color features are extracted
with the help of handcrafted descriptors while the spatial features are extracted with the
help of D-CNN models. These Bags of Features (BoF) are concatenated to form visual
vocabulary (VV) vector which is provided as an input to the classiﬁer.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine if they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework.
