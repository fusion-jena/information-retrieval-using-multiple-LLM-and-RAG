Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To deploy this application to the web, a containerization system was 
used. Docker is an open platform which is used for building, distributing, 
and running containerized applications (Rad et al., 2017). Using Docker, 
the  container  was  built  and  hosted  with  Google  Cloud  Run,  which  is 
another  service  that  is  used  to  build  and  deploy  containerized 

applications. 

2.8. Methodology summarized in a data flow diagram 

The  whole  methodology  was  summarized  in  a  data  flow  diagram 
depicted  in  Fig.  4.  The  training  phase  consisted  of  using  the  labeled 
dataset to train the detection models, the validation phase consisted of 
evaluating and fine tune hyperparameters, while the performance of the 
final models were using the test images. The best trained model was used 
to  build  a  web  application  to  detect  alates  on  sorghum  leaves  auto-
matically, which is open-source available. 

3. Results

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

Fig. 1. Examples of images at 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution without (A) or with annotations (B) of alates using the polygon tool in the labeling section of the 
cloud-based Roboflow environment (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022). 

using  the  Common  Objects  in  Context  (COCO)  dataset  for  training 
(Ultralytics, 2023). As the YOLOv5 version increases from nano towards 
extra-large,  the  file  size  and  processing  time  increases  (Ultralytics, 
2023). 

consisted of a NVIDIA A100 GPU from Google's cloud server integrated 
with an open-source Python notebook available based on the YOLOv5 
family repository by Ultralytics and Roboflow (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022; 
Ultralytics, 2023).

Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.
