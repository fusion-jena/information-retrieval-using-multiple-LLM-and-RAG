Assuming p represents the probability of a fish selecting the right- 
hand  side  of  a  tank  if  rewarded  for  such  a  choice,  the  likelihood  of 
choosing the right side in subsequent trials increases. Bush and Wilson 
suggested that the updated probability for opting for the right side fol-
lows  the  formula  α1p + 1 (cid:0) α1,  where  α1,  a  learning  parameter,  falls 
between 0 and 1. For instance, with p = 0.4 and α1 = 0.8, the updated 
probability calculates to 0.52. Similarly, it is hypothesized that rewards 
for  selecting  the  left  side  would  also  adjust  the  probability  of  future 
right-side choices, albeit more modestly.

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, some general strategies can be discussed based on common practices in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like initializing weights randomly, shuffling data before training, dropout regularization techniques, and stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms. To manage this randomness and ensure reproducibility, researchers employ several strategies:

1. Setting a fixed random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers across different runs of the code. This helps maintain consistency in results when comparing experiments or sharing findings.

2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some operations, like sorting or matrix multiplication, have both non-deterministic and deterministic versions. Opting for deterministic algorithms ensures consistent output given the same input.

3. Controlling parallelism: When running computations in parallel, there may be subtle differences between runs due to varying execution order. Limiting parallelism or controlling thread scheduling can help reduce these discrepancies.

4. Documenting dependencies: Keep track of all libraries and their respective versions used during development. Updating packages without proper version control could introduce unexpected changes in performance or behavior.

5. Version control systems: Utilize tools like Git to keep track of code modifications over time. This allows researchers to easily roll back changes if needed and collaborate effectively with others.

These strategies contribute to maintaining reproducible results and managing randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it should be noted that while reducing variability is essential for validating models and drawing reliable conclusions, embracing certain aspects of randomness can lead to better generalization and prevent overfitting.
