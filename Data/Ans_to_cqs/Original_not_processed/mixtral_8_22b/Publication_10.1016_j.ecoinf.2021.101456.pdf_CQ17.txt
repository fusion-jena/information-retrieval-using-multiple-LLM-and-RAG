The trade-off between the two loss terms can have influence on the 
performance of any VAE. A VAE where the reconstruction term domi-
nates might be able to reconstruct the input data well with a latent space 
that might  not be interesting  for the  downstream tasks  (such as clus-
tering). To alleviate this, a simple trick of scaling the regularization term 
‚Ñírec  was used in  Higgins et al. (2016) resulting in a modified objective: 

‚ÑíŒ≤(cid:0) VAE = ‚Ñírec + Œ≤‚Ñíreg.

The  quality  of  the  auto-encoded  reconstructions  is  controlled  by  the 
reconstruction loss ‚Ñírec, which is the first term in Eq. (1). The encoder 
density is regularized to match the prior over the latent variable, p(z) ‚àº
ùí© (0bf,I), enforced by the regularization loss, ‚Ñíreg, which is the Kullback- 
Leibler divergence (KLD) term in Eq. (1). At a high level, the regulari-
zation term controls the smoothness or the regularity of the latent space. 
Well structured and smooth latent spaces can yield useful representa-
tions of the input data.

until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent

reported in Table 1.

Here the role of Œ≤ ‚â• 0 is to balance the reconstruction- and regulariza-
tion losses. Typically, lower Œ≤ values yield better reconstructions but a 
less regularized latent space and less disentangled features. On the other 
hand, higher Œ≤ may lead to posterior collapse, where all reconstructions 
are reduced to the average input and the KLD approaches zero. Various 
methods have been proposed to overcome this instability in achieving a 
reasonable trade-off between the loss terms. A common implementation 
is Œ≤-annealing, where Œ≤ is gradually increased from a very low value up 
to a fixed point. While this solves the initial stability problems, the task 
of finding the optimal value of Œ≤ remains. Recently, it has been shown 
that repeating the process with a cyclic Œ≤ can lead to better performance 
(Fu et al., 2019). However, when unchecked both implementations face 
the risk of posterior collapse (vanishing KLD) once Œ≤ enters a stationary

Helpful Answer:
In the context of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), one method used to prevent overfitting and improve the structure of the latent space is through the use of a regularization term, denoted as ‚Ñíreg. This term is part of the modified objective function for the VAE, given by ‚ÑíŒ≤(cid:0) VAE = ‚Ñírec + Œ≤‚Ñíreg, where ‚Ñírec represents the reconstruction loss and Œ≤ is a hyperparameter controlling the balance between the reconstruction and regularization losses.

The regularization term itself is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), which measures the difference between the learned distribution and the desired prior distribution. By minimizing the KLD, we encourage the learned distribution to closely follow the prior distribution, thus promoting a more structured and smoother latent space.

To further enhance the regularization effect, a technique called Œ≤-annealing is often employed. This involves gradually increasing the value of Œ≤ from a small starting value until it reaches a predetermined maximum. This gradual increase helps stabilize the training process and mitigate potential issues such as posterior collapse, where the learned representations become too simplified due to excessive regularization.

Recently, another approach using cyclical Œ≤ values has been suggested to achieve even better performance. This method involves periodically varying the value of Œ≤ within a certain range, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the regularization strength throughout the training process.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they serve a similar purpose in preventing overfitting and improving generalizability in the context of VAEs.
