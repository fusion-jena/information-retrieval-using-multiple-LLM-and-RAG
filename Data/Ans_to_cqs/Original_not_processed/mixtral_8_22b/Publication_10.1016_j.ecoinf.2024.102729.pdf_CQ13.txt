achieved the highest accuracy. In autumn, the optimized RF model included three input variables: 

EC, TN, and WZ. It displayed excellent performance with adj_R2 = 0.992, RMSE = 1.505, MAE = 

0.859, and KGE = 0.972 for the training data, and adj_R2 = 0.863, RMSE = 7.182, MAE = 3.598,

comprehensive  strategy  to  elucidate  the  role  of  environmental  stressors  that  modulate 

phytoplankton  dynamics.  This  approach  advances  our  understanding  more  than  the  -often 

uncertain-  insights  gained  from  complex  overparameterized  mechanistic  models  (Baker  et  al., 

2018; Nelson et al., 2018; Arhonditsis et al., 2007; 2019a,b). ML techniques capable of identifying 

generalizable  non-linear  patterns  have  been  successful  in  predicting  chlorophyll-a  (Chl  a),  a 

commonly used proxy for algal biomass and a direct indicator to evaluate the ecological state of 

inland  waters.  Among  the  ML  methods,  Random  Forest  (RF)  modeling  emerges  as  a  popular 

ensemble learning method to examine complex relationships, known for its resilience to data noise,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a helpful response regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. However, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (such as Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent), and regularization parameters like dropout rate or weight decay. These hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model and require careful tuning through processes such as grid search or random search.
