Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The context only mentions that researchers have developed and published their models for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for acoustic detection, but it does not specify whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
