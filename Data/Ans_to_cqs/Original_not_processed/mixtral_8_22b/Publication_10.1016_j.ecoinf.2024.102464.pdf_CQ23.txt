In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

the species distribution model results were land cover, vegetation (forest 
type, age class, diameter, and density), terrain (Dem, Aspect, Hill Shade, 
Slope,  and  TWI),  and  distance  (distance  to  water,  distance  to  forests, 
distance to agricultural land, distance to grassland, distance to roads, 
and distance to urban areas) (Kwon, 2014; Song and Kim, 2012). We 
conducted a correlation analysis of the variables before model imple-
mentation  to  enhance  the  predictive  performance  of  the  model  and 
mitigate the risk of overfitting.

urban development. It is important to carefully consider and evaluate 
the effectiveness of different conservation strategies and management 
practices  to  make  informed  decisions  about  how  to  best  protect  and 
preserve ecosystems and biodiversity.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the researchers used data from two separate natural environment surveys and implemented a correlation analysis of the variables before model implementation. This suggests that they aimed to improve the robustness and reliability of their findings by considering multiple sources of data and reducing potential biases. Additionally, the use of seven different machine learning models indicates an attempt to compare and validate the results across various methodologies. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
