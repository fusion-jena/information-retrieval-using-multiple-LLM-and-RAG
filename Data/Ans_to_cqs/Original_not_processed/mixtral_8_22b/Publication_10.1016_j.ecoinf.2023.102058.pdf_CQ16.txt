PCR  is  a  linear  regression  model  obtained  by  combining  multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  and  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  to 
suppress the problem of MLR methods facing the multi-collinearity be-
tween  variables  (Liu  et  al.,  2003).  PLSR  is  another  linear  regression 
method  that  projects  independent  variables  (X)  as  predictors  and 
dependent  variables  (Y)  as  responses  into  a  set  of  orthogonal  latent 
factors while maximising the covariance between X- and Y-scores (Wold 
et al., 2001). In RF, as an ensemble learning method, decision trees are 
trained and then a voting procedure is employed to combine the result 
obtained by each tree. Unlike the noise sensitivity of every single tree’s 
prediction outcome, uncorrelated trees combination will not yield that 
much noisy results. Furthermore, training data will be created by the 
bagging  approach,  drawing  sample  subsets  with  replacement,  which

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the mentioned models (PCR, PLSR, or RF). However, generally speaking, there are several common criteria used to decide when training should stop:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: This criterion involves monitoring the validation loss during training. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly and remains nearly constant over several epochs, it can indicate that the model has learned all it can from the training data, and further training may lead to overfitting.

2. Early Stopping: Similar to the validation loss plateau, early stopping monitors the validation loss but automatically halts training once the validation loss fails to improve after a certain number of epochs. This helps prevent overfitting and saves computational resources.

3. Maximum Number of Iterations/Epochs: Training can also be stopped based on reaching a predefined maximum number of iterations or epochs. This ensures that the training process doesn't continue indefinitely if other criteria aren't met.

4. Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule where the learning rate gradually decreases over time. Once the learning rate reaches a minimum threshold, training can be considered complete.

Without more specific details about the training process for these models, it isn't possible to pinpoint exactly which criteria were used. Still, one or more of these general criteria might have been applied to determine when training was complete.
