4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  users’  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources are used for training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred from the context that the process involves training and storing models using an interface provided by the site and its computational resources. This suggests that the training likely uses some form of hardware acceleration, such as GPUs or TPUs, given the common use of these resources in deep learning applications. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the hardware resources used, it cannot be definitively stated which ones are utilized for training the deep learning models.
