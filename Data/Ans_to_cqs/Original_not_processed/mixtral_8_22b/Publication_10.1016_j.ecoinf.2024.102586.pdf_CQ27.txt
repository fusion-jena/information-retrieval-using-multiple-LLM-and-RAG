2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced
