and its relevance to ecological soundscape analysis will depend heavily 
on  the  distribution  of  the  training  data,  what  training  paradigm  was

used  and  the  learning  capacity,  complexity  and  architecture  of  the 
model.

2.5. Pre-training 

The VAE was trained under variational inference to reconstruct mini- 
batches of 6 spectrograms over a maximum of 100,000 batches with a 
hold out split for both validation and test of 20%. Stochastic gradient 
descent is performed using the Adam optimiser (Diederik and Ba, 2017) 
using weight decay. To maximise reconstruction quality without over- 
fitting the learning rate was tweaked to an optimal configuration of η =
0.0005, undergoing annealing by a factor of 100 using a cosine function 
over  the  duration  of  the  training  (He  et  al.,  2018).  The  means  μ  and 
standard  deviations  σ  of  the  latent  distribution  for  all  T  frames  were 
encoded  as  a  set  of  feature  embeddings  and  used  in  subsequent 
experiments.

The  data  split  from  the  VAE  training  procedure  is  preserved  and 
validation samples were aggregated into the test set. Observations are 
grouped by site pairs and samples are encoded to produce subsets Z(a,b)
containing learned representations for a site pair (a, b). We fit a binary 
logistic regression model for each site pair, finding a weight vector w and 
orthogonal hyperplane Z(a,b)w + b = 0. After classification, a sample is 
selected from each site, denoted xk, and we encode the representation 
time-series, 
.  We  encode  only  15  s  to  aid  interpretation  of 
reconstructed spectrogram images. We apply a linear transformation of 
each time step independently by interpolating along the gradient of the 
regression line orthogonal to the hyperplane, adding the weights scaled 
by distance δ, where δ  is the distance from the hyperplane in a linear 
model. This yields a new feature time-series where the site classification

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given context, it appears that the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) was trained under variational inference to reconstruct mini-batches of 6 spectrograms over a maximum of 100,000 batches. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a certain accuracy threshold. Instead, the focus seems to be on maximizing reconstruction quality without overfitting, which was achieved by tweaking the learning rate to an optimal configuration and employing stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. Additionally, weight decay was utilized, and the learning rate underwent annealing by a factor of 100 using a cosine function over the duration of the training. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
