these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

3. Results

To re-identify the candidate regions, we inputted outputs from the 
YOLOv4  into  the  EfficientNet.  As  mentioned  above,  there  were  eight 
types of the EfficientNet. Starting from the baseline EfficientNet-B0, the 
baseline network was scaled up from EfficientNet-B1 to B7 based on the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for either YOLOv4 or EfficientNet models. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss and accuracy during training, and stopping the process once these values reach a plateau or desired threshold. Other techniques like early stopping can be employed to prevent overfitting by halting the training if no improvement is observed after several epochs.
