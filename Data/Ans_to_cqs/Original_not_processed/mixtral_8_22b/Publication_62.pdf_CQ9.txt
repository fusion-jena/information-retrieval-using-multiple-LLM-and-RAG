typically accessible only to researchers who can physically visit repositories. Digitization
eﬀorts obviate the need for many types of in-person data gathering (Beaman and Cellinese
2012)   and   remarkable   progress   is   now   being   made   in   compiling   specimen   data   and
images   (Barkworth   and   Murrell   2012).   Coupling   these   data   with   the   classiﬁcation
capabilities of CNNs will unlock more of the rich potential of NHCs.

Deep   learning   might   ultimately   be   leveraged   in   many   ways   for   many   diﬀerent   types   of
NHCs.   Here,   we   focus   on   the   digitized   portion   (currently   1.2   million   specimens)   of   the
United States National Herbarium. Our analyses, focused on the detection of specimens
previously treated with mercury and the discrimination of superﬁcially similar plant families,
are complementary to those recently published on species identiﬁcation (Carranza-Rojas et
al. 2017) and further demonstrate how CNNs might be used to learn more from NHCs.

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is stated that the authors have provided supplementary materials which include notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These notebooks are available for download as.nb files (Mathematica notebooks) or.pdf files (annotated versions). Unfortunately, there is no mention of a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where this data has been uploaded. Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
