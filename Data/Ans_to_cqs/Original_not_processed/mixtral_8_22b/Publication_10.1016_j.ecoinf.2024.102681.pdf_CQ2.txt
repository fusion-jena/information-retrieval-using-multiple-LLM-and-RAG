SPEI time scale corresponding to the highest probability was identified 
as  that  month's  representative  drought  propagation  time.  With  this 
method,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the  propagation  time  for  different 
drought propagation scenarios occurring in different months and obtain 
the probability of this drought propagation occurring. 

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a feed-forward neural 
network primarily used to process gridded data of a fixed size. Its main 
advantage  is  the  ability  to  automatically  learn  spatial  hierarchies, 
making it highly suitable for processing data such as images, sounds, and 
time series. In this study, CNN is utilized to fit linear and nonlinear re-
lationships  between  independent  and  dependent  variables  and  in-
teractions  between  independent  variables(Gu  et  al.,  2018).  The  core 
formula of CNN is as follows:

where f and g are the input and the convolution kernel, respectively, i 
and  j  are  the  coordinates  of  the  output  image,  and  m  and  n  are  the 
relative positions of the convolution kernel as it slides across the input 
image. 

The Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), a specialized variant 
of  Recurrent  Neural  Networks  (RNNs),  facilitates  the  dependent  vari-
able's influence by incorporating not only the contemporaneous inde-
pendent  variables  but  also  the  historical  levels  of  these  variables(Pei 
et  al.,  2019).  LSTM  can  solve  the  problem  of  gradient  vanishing  and 
gradient explosion that RNNs tend to encounter when processing long 
sequences. LSTM controls the flow of information by introducing a gate 
mechanism that allows the network to learn and remember a long-time 
series of dependencies. The main equations include:

Helpful Answer:

The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is primarily used to process gridded data of a fixed size, which could imply that the data used in this study might be in a grid or matrix format. Additionally, the text states that CNN is highly suitable for processing data such as images, sounds, and time series, suggesting that any of these types of data could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline. Furthermore, the study employs a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year, indicating that the data may be in a time series format. Therefore, while the exact data format cannot be determined from the given context, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline could be in a grid/matrix format, time series format, or possibly other formats like images or sound files.
