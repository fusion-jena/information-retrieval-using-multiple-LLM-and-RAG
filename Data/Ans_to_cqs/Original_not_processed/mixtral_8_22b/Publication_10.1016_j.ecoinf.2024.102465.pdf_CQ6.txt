The experiment utilized the pre-trained “ERNIE” model (https://gith 
ub.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE). 
a 
comparative  analysis  of  the  accuracy  of  Rostcm  6.0,  Simple  Bayesian 
Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-
tional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  in  pre-tests,  the  decision  was  made  to 
employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the input data. These steps help improve the quality of the data and ensure better performance from the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It ensures that only relevant information is used during the training phase.

2. Normalization: Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. This technique helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale, which could lead to poor model performance.

3. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling transforms the feature values into a specific range. However, unlike normalization, scaling does not restrict the output to a [0, 1] interval. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Standardization.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since neural networks cannot directly handle categorical variables, they need to be converted into numerical form. Techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding can be employed for this purpose.

5. Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most important features from the dataset can significantly reduce computational complexity while improving model performance. Methods like correlation matrix, mutual information, or even domain knowledge can aid in feature selection.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset artificially, various augmentation techniques can be applied. For example, images can be rotated, flipped, zoomed, etc., to create new samples.

In summary, preprocessing steps play a crucial role in preparing datasets for deep learning models. They involve tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, feature selection, and data augmentation. Each step contributes towards enhancing the quality of the input data, thereby leading to improved model performance.
