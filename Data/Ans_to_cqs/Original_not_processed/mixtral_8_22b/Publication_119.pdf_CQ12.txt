the U-Net model is the labeling of each pixel in the training data. Abundant data are needed
for training deep neural networks of at least 1000 image samples. In such cases, a pretrained
network can reduce the amount of training data needed [47]. The U-Net implemented
within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet.

a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 increased the testing accuracy of the model. These additional layers—dropout and batch normalization—reduce the over-fitting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data. The hyperparameters in this network—the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size—were further tuned such that the testing accuracy and the kappa were the best among all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.  Figure 4.

2.7. Accuracy Assessment

The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model. The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It consists of two parts: a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). The encoder captures high-level features by applying multiple convolutions and pooling operations, while the decoder reconstructs the original image resolution using transposed convolution or upsampling operations.

In this case, the U-Net model is implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python and has a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet. This means that the initial weights of the U-Net model are obtained from a pretrained ResNet-50 model trained on the ImageNet dataset. Using a pretrained model helps reduce the amount of training data required and speeds up the training process.

Additionally, the U-Net model includes dropout and batch normalization layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. The hyperparameters of the model, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, have been optimized to achieve the highest testing accuracy and kappa score among all models.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
