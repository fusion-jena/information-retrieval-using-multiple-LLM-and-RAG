To  ensure  comparability  across  trained  models,  we  maintained 
consistent hyperparameters across all training instances for each task (i. 
e.,  SEIO  PBW  vocalization  and  Dcall).  Specifically,  for  SEIO  PBW 

vocalization  training  and  blue  whale  Dcall  training,  we  set  the  batch 
sizes to 5 and 4, and the learning rates to 1e-4 and 1e-3, respectively. 
This decision was based on the fact that more samples were used for 
SEIO PBW vocalization training. The models were trained for 40 and 25 
epochs  respectively.  However  an  early  stopping  method  was  used  to 
keep  the  model  weights  before  the  models  overfitted.  The  patience 
parameter is set at 10 epochs for all training phases. 

2.4. Evaluation metrics 

Considering  the  absence  of  absolute  ground  truth  for  identifying 
audio events within underwater acoustic recordings, the annotation sets 
proposed by the annotators, expert or novice, are called pseudo ground 
truth in the present study.

distinctive  annotation  profiles  influenced  by  the  complexity  of  vocalizations  and  the  annotators’  strategies, 
ranging from conservative to permissive. To address the challenges of annotation discrepancies, Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and the expert. The results show varia-
tions in model performance. Our work highlights the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more 
conservative  approach  to  improve  overall  annotation  quality.  In  an  effort  to  optimize  the  potential  of  multi- 
annotation  and  mitigate  the  presence  of  noisy  labels,  two  annotation  aggregation  methods  (majority  voting 
and  soft  labeling)  are  proposed  and  tested.  The  results  demonstrate  that  both  methods,  particularly  when  a 
sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability:

During  the  campaign,  methods  are  proposed  to  assess  inter- 
annotator  variability  and  aggregate  annotation  sets.  Those  methods 
will help to define the minimal number of annotators needed [Dubus 
et al., 2023; Walter et al., 2022]. Increasing the number of annotators 
per sample could be helpful if the variability is too high. Finally, the two 
grouping  methods:  majority  voting  (Section  2.2.3)  and  soft  labeling 
(Section 2.3.2) can also be used to produce relevant annotation sets for 
deep learning. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study, new approaches were explored to improve the accuracy 
and  efficiency  of  cetacean  vocalization  detection  using  deep  learning 
models. Leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert 
and novice annotators aimed to address the challenges associated with 
the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater PAM studies.

However,  it  has  been  observed  that  annotation  sets  used  to  train 
models qualified as “permissive annotators” get lower performance than 
the ones qualified as “conservative annotators”  even with comparable 
F1 score with the annotations from the experts. Gu et al. (2023) also 
proposed that at the same ratio of noise on the training set, the model’s 
performance can decrease differently regarding the type of noise. In this 
study,  it  seems  that  simple  convolutional  neural  network  models 
generalize better from the most obvious examples and the introduction 
of false positives deteriorates the performance more than the omission of 
a vocalization in the annotation set. For future annotation campaigns, 
this  result  might  suggest  that  instructing  annotators  to  adopt  a  more 
conservative approach could be beneficial.

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the batch sizes and learning rates. For SEIO PBW vocalization training, the batch size was set to 5 and the learning rate was set to 1e-4. For blue whale Dcall training, the batch size was set to 4 and the learning rate was set to 1e-3. These decisions were made based on the fact that more samples were used for SEIO PBW vocalization training. Additionally, the models were trained for 40 and 25 epochs respectively, but an early stopping method was used to keep the model weights before they became overfit. The patience parameter was set at 10 epochs for all training phases.
