5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution. 

6. Conclusions

(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer its purpose by examining the title of the cited paper: "Deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery" (Lassalle et al., 2022). Based on this information, we can deduce that the deep learning model aims to perform object detection or instance segmentation tasks, specifically focusing on identifying individual tree crowns within mangrove forests using high-resolution satellite imagery.

In general, deep learning models are widely employed for various applications such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Each task has a specific goal:

1. Image Classification: Assigning one label to an entire input image. For example, determining whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
2. Object Detection: Identifying objects within an image and drawing bounding boxes around them. For example, detecting cars in a street scene.
3. Semantic Segmentation: Labeling every pixel in an image with a corresponding class. For example, assigning labels like road, sky, building, etc., to pixels in a cityscape image.
4. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but also differentiates instances of the same class. For example, distinguishing between multiple cars in a parking lot.

Based on the title of the referenced paper, it appears that the deep learning model in question focuses on either object detection or instance segmentation, aiming to identify individual tree crowns within mangrove forests using high-resolution satellite imagery.
