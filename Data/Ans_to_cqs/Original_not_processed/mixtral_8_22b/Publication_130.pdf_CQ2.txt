Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several mentions of photographs, pictures, and images throughout the text. For instance, the discussion revolves around photographing animals, collecting large labeled datasets of images, and normalizing picture arrays. Furthermore, the mention of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) suggests image processing, as CNNs are primarily used for analyzing visual imagery. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is predominantly images.
