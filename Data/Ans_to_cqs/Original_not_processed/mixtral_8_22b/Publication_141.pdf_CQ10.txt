ImageNet) (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Since 2012, there has been
signiﬁcant improvement in deep learning CNN architectures that
have led to better classiﬁcation results in the ImageNet challenge.
Here lies an opportunity to use a similar structure and approach
for targeted application in biomonitoring studies that could incor-
porate high-resolution information from the Chironomidae in
inferences of ecosystem integrity.

A deep learning process with CNNs successfully classiﬁed mor-
phologically very similar chironomid specimens with high accu-
racy to species level. While this is a pioneering demonstration of
the use of this technique, the potential for automatic identiﬁcation
of chironomids and other difﬁcult to identify taxa in bioassessment
is high. Machine learning extracted a similar suite of features to
those used in conventional identiﬁcation keys. The data acquisition
protocol and deep learning architecture of this study offers a
unique design which can be applied to chironomid identiﬁcation
as well as other macroinvertebrate groups. Such an approach will
consequently increase the efﬁciency of routine monitoring pro-
grams. Since non-biting midges are a group that is characterized
with a large diversity of morphological characters, future research
should focus on increasing the number of entities (species) in the
model as well as testing the accuracy along a geographical scale.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

2.1. Chironomid dataset acquisition

To construct the CNN model, 10 chironomid taxa collected from
5 sampling sites within the South Morava river basin, Serbia, were
used as inputs (Miloševic´ et al., 2013). A lab-based image acquisi-
tion protocol was applied to specimens (Fig. 1).
