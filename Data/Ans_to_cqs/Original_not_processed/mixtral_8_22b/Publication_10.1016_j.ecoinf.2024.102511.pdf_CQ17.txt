Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-

(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular,

Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong

for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020;

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it can be inferred from the information given that these techniques might be employed when developing automated machine learning classification models, particularly those involving deep neural networks.

Deep learning models often face challenges with overfitting due to their complexity and ability to learn intricate patterns within large datasets. To mitigate this issue, various regularization methods can be applied during model training. Dropout is one common technique where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed from the network during each iteration, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing co-dependencies between nodes. Another method mentioned indirectly through the citation of Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) is data augmentation, which involves creating additional synthetic samples by applying transformations like rotations, translations, or scaling to existing images. This approach effectively increases dataset size without collecting new data, thus helping improve generalization and preventing overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, imposes a penalty on the magnitude of weights in the model, encouraging smaller values and promoting simpler representations. By adding a term proportional to the sum of squared weights to the loss function, L2 regularization discourages excessive growth of individual weights, thereby reducing overfitting. Although not directly discussed in the provided context, L2 regularization could potentially be utilized alongside other strategies to develop robust and reliable automated classification routines for bioacoustic analysis.
