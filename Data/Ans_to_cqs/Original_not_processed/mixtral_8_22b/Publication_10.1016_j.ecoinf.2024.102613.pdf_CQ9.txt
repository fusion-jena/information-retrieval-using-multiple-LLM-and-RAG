more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

modern farming to get insight into the daily practices of its processes. 
Therefore,  the  phrase  “farming”,  “agriculture”,“  smart  farming”,  and 
“precision  agriculture”  are  our  main  phrases  to  combine  with  the 
“reference architecture”. The next step is identifying the recent trends in 
data  management.  According  to  Giray  and  Catal  (Giray  and  Catal, 
2021),  big  data,  machine  learning,  and  data  lake  are  emerging  tech-

Based on their research, this study adopts the phrases used to represent 
data management and combines them with the other phrases explained 
earlier. This search strategy has been applied in the Scopus database to 
collect  the  papers.  To  assure  sufficient  coverage,  the  manual  search 
method was also conducted.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects such as the use of IoT devices and sensors in modern farming, the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for analyzing generated data, and the limitations of traditional data management systems. Additionally, it mentions a search strategy involving specific phrases related to data management and farming, which was applied in the Scopus database to collect papers. However, there is no mention of any specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
