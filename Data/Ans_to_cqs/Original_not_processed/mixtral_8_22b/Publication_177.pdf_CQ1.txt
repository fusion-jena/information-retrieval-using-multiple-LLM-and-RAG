training while 40% of the images were used for testing. In 
order to develop and compare the models for both datasets, 
we split the original 40% testing data into validation (20%) 
and testing (20%). So, the final distribution of the dataset 
was  60%  for  training,  20%  for  validation,  and  20%  for 
testing.

of 87.8% and 91.2% respectively. A comparative evaluation 
of deep learning models was performed by [20] to identify 109 
plant  species  from  the  28,046  images  collected  online.  The 
results  showed  that  MobileNetV2  emerged  as  the  best 
performing  model  with  an  accuracy  of  83.9%  compared  to 
other models. Unlike the approach of [17],[18],[19], and [20], 
Krause  et  al.  [21]  proposed  a  two-stage  approach  for 
identifying  plant  species  from  the  natural  environment.  In 
their  proposed  method,  the  authors  used  a  deep  learning 
semantic segmentation model to segment the plant from the 
images and then used a multiscale crop of the segmented plant 
to train an Inception-ResNet-V2 model. Using the dataset of 
100  species  with  4,500  training  images,  the  proposed 
approach improved the performance of the model by 5.4% to 
achieve  an  accuracy  of  89.21%.  To  study  the  taxonomic

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used various sources such as publicly available datasets or custom image collections obtained through surveys or sensors. For example, in the case of identifying plant species, they could have gathered images from botanical gardens, forests, or other natural environments using cameras or drones equipped with sensors. Additionally, some studies mentioned in the references section may have employed online resources like Google Images or PlantCLEF datasets for their research purposes.
