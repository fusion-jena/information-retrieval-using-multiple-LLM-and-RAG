Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

research center. The Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in 
Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

3.1.4. Calculate processing 

The following processes were carried out within GEE to produce a 
thorough  time  series  dataset  that  included  land  cover  types,  wildfire 
locations, NBR, and above-ground biomass data in mainland China:  

• First, filter the feature collection on GEE by using the MCD64A1 date 
attribute  “Burndate”  (calendar  day).  The  range  1–366  is  used  to 
represent  the  fire  occurrence  area  that  has  been  labeled  as  “Bur-
narea.”  After that, it was easier to extract the land cover types for 
each  year  by  overlaying  MCD12Q1,  and  MOD17A3  was  used  to 
calculate the annual NPP. The “ForestFireArea” image collection was 
then created by adding attribute information using the “image.add-
Bands()” API.

Mi = Ai × BAGB × Ci × λi

(4)  

where Mi refers to the combustible material load of the i-th forest type 
(t), Ai denotes the area engulfed by fire of the i-th forest category (hm2), 
BAGB reflects the above-ground biomass per unit area (tC/hm2), Ci is the 
proportion of biomass specific to the i-th forest type, λi  stands for the 
combustion efficiency associated with the i-th type of forest resource.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The text mentions machine learning techniques being employed but does not specify whether these are deep learning models or other types of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, no mention is made of any specific deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot definitively state which type of deep learning model is utilized in this case.
