enables advanced search of data across the data packages in ESS-DIVE

like processing, cleaning, and curation of the data (the ESIP Research 
Object  Citation  Cluster  is  addressing  this  now).  The  importance  of 
acknowledging these roles increases when data are synthesized and/or 
transformed,  as  the integration  process requires  extensive intellectual 
effort.

The most significant challenge in implementing data collections is 
ensuring that the datasets included in a collection receive appropriate 
credit for papers citing the collection (primary  rather than secondary 
citations). Ideally, paper(s) citing the collection should also propagate to 
the citation counts of underlying datasets. There is little or no support 
for data collection creation and usage in the current data repository and 
publisher infrastructure. Other challenges involve deciding authorship 
for a data collection (the collection creators, the authors of the under-
lying  datasets,  both,  or  nobody),  and  ensuring  that  usage  licenses  of 
underlying datasets allow that they be compiled into a collection (e.g. 
compliance with dataset attribution requirements). Potential solutions 
to  the  issue  of  collection  authorship  may  include  implementing  the 
CRediT  (https://casrai.org/credit/)  roles  for  authors  involved  in

Currently, dynamic data citations are most advantageous to support 
query-based data downloads within a single repository or data aggre-
gator and specifying subsets of data. It is particularly useful when data is 
standardized  and  specific  data  can  be  readily  integrated  within  and 
across datasets from a search query, such as integrated species occur-
rence records from hundreds of data sources in GBIF. The data consumer 
only needs to reference one citation for the custom query and download 
instead  of  all  the  underlying  data  packages.  It  also  helps  support 
repeatability and accurate credit since it enumerates the exact subset of 
the data retrieved from the repository (Rauber et al., 2016b).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
I apologize, but based on the given context, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size of training sets by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. However, without more context related to deep learning pipelines, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied.
