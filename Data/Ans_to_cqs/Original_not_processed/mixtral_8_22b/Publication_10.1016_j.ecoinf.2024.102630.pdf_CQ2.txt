2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

cloud  cover,  and  surface  information  across  NDVI  product  datasets 
result  in  distinct  strengths  and  weaknesses  for  each  product.  Conse-
quently, researchers must carefully select NDVI products to ensure data 
suitability for their specific research needs (Fensholt et al., 2009).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several types of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, including the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI). These datasets are sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform. Additionally, the study also utilizes SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets from the Resource and Environmental Data Center of the Western Sichuan alpine plateau region (WS), the Southwest Sichuan mountainous area (SS), and the Sichuan Basin (SB). Therefore, the primary data format used in this study is satellite imagery or raster data.
