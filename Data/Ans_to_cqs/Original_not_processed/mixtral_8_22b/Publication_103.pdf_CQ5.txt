• I.H255.H255: The neural network was pre-trained
on the generalist dataset ImageNet to initialize the
weights, fine-tuned on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

• R.H1K.H1K: The neural network was initialized

Herbarium specimen classification
These experiments aim at assessing the feasibility of using
a deep learning system dedicated to herbarium specimen
identification at a realistic scale (255 species from Costa-
Rica in Herbarium255 and 1K species from France in
Herbarium1K). Herbarium255 was divided in 70% train-
ing data and the rest 30% as test data used for computing
the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Herbarium1K
was divided in 80 and 20% respectively, to keep the pro-
portion of the data provided by the PC challenge. The
separation was done by species, and within each species,

ertheless, in the last five years, deep learning has become
a promising tool to handle extremely complex computer
vision tasks. Additionally, online portals of ambitious ini-
tiatives such as iDigBio already provide access to more
than 14 million herbarium images [9] that are particu-
larly useful for deep learning approaches [10]. Thus, it
is now possible to use images of herbaria thanks to cur-
rent advances in machine learning and initiatives such as
iDigBio.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize two main datasets: ImageNet and Herbarium. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It is often used for pre-training deep learning models due to its extensive coverage of various objects and scenes. On the other hand, Herbarium is a specialized dataset consisting of herbarium specimens, which are preserved plants or plant parts used for scientific study. There are two versions of this dataset mentioned: Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K, containing 255 and 1,000 different plant species, respectively. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of deep learning systems in identifying and classifying herbarium specimens accurately.
