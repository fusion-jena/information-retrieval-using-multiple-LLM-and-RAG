The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

3.5.3. Artificial neural network 

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy.

Helpful Answer:

For the Random Forest (RF) model, the hyperparameter'mtry' was systematically evaluated from 1 to 10 to find a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, the specific optimization technique used, whether it be grid search, random search, or another method, is not explicitly stated in the given context.

Regarding the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the hyperparameters'size' and 'decay' were set as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. Again, the exact optimization technique employed is not mentioned in the provided text.

Lastly, for the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the parameter 'c' was utilized to address the overfitting issue by optimizing the line fit and penalizing the number of samples within the margin. Nevertheless, the optimization approach for selecting the optimal value of 'c' remains unspecified in the given context.
