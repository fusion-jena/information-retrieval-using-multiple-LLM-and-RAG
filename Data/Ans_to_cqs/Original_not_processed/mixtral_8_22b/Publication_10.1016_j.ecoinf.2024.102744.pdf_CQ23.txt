Furthermore,  Fig.  15  depicts  some  detection  outcomes  of  the  second  proposed

feature  images  while  retaining  crucial  features.  The  Dropout  layer  is  integrated  to  mitigate 

overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

5.4. Application to the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees 

Counting the number of pollen-bearing bees entering the hive enables beekeepers to monitor the 

hive’s food status and promptly replenish it if necessary. Recognizing this benefit, we integrated

the objects of interest. Conversely, weights are reduced for simpler samples. 

Consequently, focal loss diminishes the impact of straightforward samples on training loss 

while  amplifying  the  significance  of  challenging  ones.  The  focal  loss  function  is  calculated  as

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are indications that suggest potential strategies used to improve the model's performance and robustness.

Firstly, the use of the VnPollenBee dataset implies that diverse data was employed for training and evaluation purposes. A diverse dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios and conditions.

Secondly, although not explicitly mentioned, the inclusion of various baseline methods and other state-of-the-art methods suggests that comparative analysis might have been performed to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness. Cross-validation or stratified splitting could potentially be part of these evaluations, but without further details, it remains speculative.

Lastly, the integration of techniques such as Dropout layers and Global Average Pooling layers in the proposed methods indicates efforts to prevent overfitting and enhance feature extraction. These practices contribute to improving the model's overall performance and generalizability.
