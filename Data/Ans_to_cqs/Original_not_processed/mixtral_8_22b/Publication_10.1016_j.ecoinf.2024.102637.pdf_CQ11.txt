In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

The combination of deep learning and bird sound recognition is widely employed in bird species conservation 
monitoring.  A  complex  network  structure  is  not  conducive  for  deploying  bird  sound  recognition  devices, 
resulting in problems such as long inference time and low efficiency. Using AlexNet as the backbone model, we 
explore the potential of shallow and straightforward models without complex connection techniques or attention 
mechanisms, named SIAlex, to recognise and classify 20 bird sound datasets, which are simultaneously validated 
on  a  10  class  UrbanSound8k  dataset.  Using  the  structural  re-parameterization  method,  the  number  of  model 
layers  is  reduced,  computational  efficiency  is  improved,  and  the  inference  time  is  significantly  reduced, 
achieving a decoupling of training and inference time in the structure. To increase the nonlinearity of the model,

The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  Section  2  in-
troduces the relevant work of previous researchers and the processing 
steps of the dataset. Section 3 introduces the optimisation methods of 
the model. Section 4 introduces the experimental results and compares 
the test results of different networks. The discussion and conclusion are 
presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.
