specific projects often require detailed soil information from a particular 
site,  delving  below  the  soil  surface  and  taking  into  account  varying 
depths. Technicians typically gather this information through soil sur-
veys and present it as raw data to professionals. However, this format 
can  create  challenges  in  effectively  communicating  and  collaborating 
across  disciplines.  Various  research  efforts  have  made  strides  in 
addressing these concerns: Yang et al. (2022) developed a framework for 
the  preliminary  delineation  of  soil  profile  horizons;  Alqadad  et  al. 
(2017)  documented  several  accidents that occurred  during urban  soil 
investigation  due  to  outdated  soil  profile  information;  Temme  and 
Vanwalleghem (2016) introduced a new model linking landscape and 
soil profile evolution based on sensitivity analysis; Pourabdollah et al. 
(2012)  proposed  a  data  exchange  schema  for  soil  and  terrain  data;

The  core  principle  of  node-based  programming  pertains  to  the 
employment of an abstracted node model for the representation of data 
or a computing operator. Each “node” accepts zero or multiple inputs and 
yields outputs subsequent to executing a computing operation. The scope 
of these computational operations encompasses elementary arithmetic 
tasks  as well  as intricate customized functions  necessitating consider-
able computational resources. (Fig. 8). 

The  intricacy  of  project  development  for  users  is  predominantly 
contingent upon the assortment of nodes supplied by both the software 
development  team  (intrinsic  default  functions)  and  community  de-
velopers  (plugin  functions).  A  robust  platform  typically  reaps  the  ad-
vantages  of  an  active  community-driven  ecosystem,  encompassing 
hundreds of plugins contributed by an array of sources. This, in turn, 
enables an extensive scope of functionality and customization for the 
end-users.

Beaudette  et  al.  (2013)  developed  algorithms  to  support  data-driven 
approaches to common soils-related tasks.

Helpful Answer:
While the provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general principles can be applied. Data bias can occur when certain classes or features are overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset, leading to poor performance of the deep learning models. To mitigate this issue, various techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of samples in each class to achieve balance. In oversampling, additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset, whereas in undersampling, majority class examples are removed until balance is achieved. These techniques help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from different sources, environments, and conditions to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of scenarios. This helps improve its ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.

In summary, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. By employing these techniques, one can improve the performance and reliability of their deep learning models.
