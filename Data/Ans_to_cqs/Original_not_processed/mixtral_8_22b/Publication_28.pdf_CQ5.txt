Lunga  et  al.  (2020)  presented  a  new  remote  sensing  data  flow 
(RESFlow) to an advanced ML for computing huge amount of remotely 
sensed images. The important role is separating huge amount of data for 
homogeneous distribution to fit easier modules. Nguyen et  al. (2020) 
proposed  a  new  multi  temporal  high  spatial  resolution  classification 
technique using an innovative spatio temporal spectral DNN for locating 
paddy fields at the pixel level for an entire year and temporal instances. 
Boulila et al. (2021) proposed a new distributed DL based method for 
classifying the big remote sensing images. Particularly, they proposed an 
RS-DCNN for managing image classification. The initial phase is to make 
the  training  dataset  for  RS-DCNN.  Later,  for  ensuring  a  data  parallel 
training  on  Apache  Spark  architecture,  a  pixel  based  CNN  module 
through the big data cluster is executed by BigDL.

Liu et al. (2020) presented 2 novel high resolution satellite imagery 
datasets  (SAT-4  and  SAT-6)  and  presented  a  DeepSat architecture  for 
classification is depending upon DBN and “handcrafted”  features. The 
presented study is an extensive form, they presented an end to end ar-
chitecture leverage an enhanced framework that increases a CNN using 
handcrafted features (rather than utilizing DBN based framework) for 
classification.  Pelletier  et  al.  (2019)  proposed  extensive  research  of 
TempCNNs,  a  DL  method  that  employs  convolution  in  the  temporal 
dimension for manually learning the temporal (also spectral) features. 
The aim of this study is to qualitatively and quantitatively calculate the 
contributions of TempCNN for classifying SITS, as related to RNN and RF 
a regular DL method is mainly fitted to temporal data.
