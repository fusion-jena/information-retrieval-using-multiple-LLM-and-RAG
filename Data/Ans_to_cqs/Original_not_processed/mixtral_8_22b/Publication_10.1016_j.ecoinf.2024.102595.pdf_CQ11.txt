Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

In summary, this study analyzes various machine learning and deep 
learning models applied to predict oil palm yield. The standout perfor-
mance of models like the Extra Trees Regressor and LightGBM Regres-
sor, as opposed to the less effective Decision Tree Regressor, highlights 
the  significance  of  model  architecture,  parameter  optimization,  and 
feature selection in tackling complex agricultural prediction tasks. 

4. Conclusions 

We  comprehensively  analyzed  17  machine  learning  and  deep 
learning  models  for  oil  palm  yield  prediction  by  utilizing  a  robust 
agronomy  dataset  encompassing  a  multitude  of  parameters  collected 
from 538 oil palm samples. This extensive dataset served as the foun-
dation  for  exploring  the  predictive  accuracies  of  different  modeling 
approaches.
