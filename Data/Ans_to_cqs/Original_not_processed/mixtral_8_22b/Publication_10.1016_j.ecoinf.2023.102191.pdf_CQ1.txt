4. Discussion 

Citizen science is increasingly becoming an important tool that en-
ables cost-effective biodiversity monitoring and initiatives oriented at 
marine environments (Garcia-Soto et al., 2021; Kelly et al., 2020). In 
SCUBA oriented citizen science initiatives, a trade-off persists between 
two  approaches  to  data  collection:  opportunistic  reporting  allows 
simplicity and participation of recreational SCUBA divers, but is prone 
to  noisy  data,  while  systematic  surveys  with  standard  protocols  offer 
higher  data  quality,  but  often  create  barriers  to  participation.  In  this 
study,  we  tested  a  novel  approach  that  provides  elements  of  stand-
ardised data collection, while retaining a recreational SCUBA dive plan, 
by leveraging a mobile app with a custom species list to conduct post- 
dive interviews and compile data.

of standardisation, by focusing on the frequency and abundance of specific taxa, while retaining a recreational 
dive  plan.  Additionally,  the  app  also  collects  metadata  on  location,  number  of  dives  and  number  of  divers 
enabling normalisation based on “sampling effort”. In this pilot study, the use of the app was tested to compile 
information on the frequency and abundance of 18 marine taxa selected by local experts based on their con-
servation  status,  commercial  interest,  ecological  function  and/or  their  non-indigenous  origin.  Additionally,  a 
question-based survey was conducted to assess the opinion of users on the app’s usability and the potential value 
for the diving community/industry, showcasing a high usability score and interest among users. Basic statistical 
analysis of the data crowdsourced over the 1-month trial illustrates the potential and value of regional moni-

curator while using the app as a tool for post-dive debriefing. Combined, 
these two steps ensure that there is a specific checklist to cross out and 
that the interview is embedded in regular operations of the dive centre. 
Another aspect that could influence data quality is the possibility of 
misidentifying  species  that  are  less  known  to  the  citizen  scientists 
(Austen  et  al.,  2016;  Freiwald  et  al.,  2018).  This  is  especially  true 
because the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, 
which  could  be  validated  by  experts  (Kosmala  et  al.,  2016)  or  using 
machine learning (Saoud et  al., 2020). Once again, by relying on the 
dive guide to conduct the interview, there is some level of validation of 
the species sighted and reported, as they are often knowledgeable and 
experienced in local fauna and flora. This approach has also been used in 
previous studies as a safeguard for data quality (Branchini et al., 2015;

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is a mobile application designed for post-dive interviews. The app focuses on gathering information about the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa, which were preselected by local experts based on various factors such as conservation status, commercial interest, ecological function, and non-indigenous origins. The app collects metadata including location, number of dives, and number of divers, enabling normalization based on sampling effort. However, it should be noted that the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, which could potentially impact data accuracy due to misidentification of species. To mitigate this issue, the app relies on experienced dive guides to validate the species sightings during the post-dive interviews.
