where t and h represent temperature and humidity resp. 
b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

5.1. Limitations of the model as a classification model 

Our classification model is built upon the Monte Carlo method. While 
Monte Carlo codes have achieved significant sophistication, simulations 

suffer  from  the  drawback  of  demanding  extensive  computational  re-
sources  to  attain  an  adequate  level  of  result  confidence.  Hence,  it  is 
crucial to acknowledge the associated limitations. 

Specifically, a substantial number of tests may be required. Insuffi-
cient  testing  could  lead  to  a  heightened  sampling  error,  resulting  in 
overly broad confidence intervals. Ensuring an ample number of trials is 
crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates.

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

model that we address in Section 6. 

After discussing the interdependency and range parameters can take, 
our aim now is to justify why E is a reliable measure to anticipate the rate 
of expansion and therefore to establish a hierarchy and a direct search 
for the optimal parameters. When we want to conclude the impact of 
parameters  on  the  expected  rate  of  expansion,  the  study  cannot  be 
limited to specific data from a particular phenomenon, since there is a 
great variety of climatic conditions and potential wind-driven events. 
This could introduce a bias into our study so, the best way for conducting 
the aforementioned study is to simulate climatic data by means of 

θ ∼ Unif (0, 2 π) and ρ ∼ Unif (0, 1).

First of all, we set an arbitrary partition 

P := {0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1}

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include:

1. Stratified Splitting: In this technique, the dataset is divided into training and test sets while preserving the original class distribution. This ensures that both subsets maintain similar characteristics, reducing the risk of biased results due to imbalanced classes.

2. Oversampling: To counteract class imbalance, oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class or generating synthetic samples using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This helps achieve a balanced dataset, improving the performance of the deep learning models.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing instances or selecting only those with high relevance. Although this approach might discard valuable information, it can still help alleviate data bias caused by class imbalance.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse datasets that cover various scenarios and edge cases can significantly reduce data bias. By incorporating different sources, demographics, and perspectives, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling unseen situations accurately.
