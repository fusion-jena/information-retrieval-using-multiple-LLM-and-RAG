Both the RF and Maxent models are well-known and popular high- 
performance,  machine learning models for ecological studies, such as 
species distribution studies. The effectiveness of the RF model has been 
well documented for the extraction of ecological information as well as 
the prediction of ecological variables including the prediction of insect 
occurrence  (Lee  et  al.,  2019;  Park  et  al.,  2013).  In  turn,  the  Maxent 
model  has  also  shown  high  performance  for  predicting  species  distri-
bution. For example, Ikegami and Jenkins (2018) predicted the distri-
bution  range  of  PWD  on  a  worldwide  scale  using  the  Maxent  model. 
Meanwhile, consistently with the results reported herein, the RF model 
reportedly showed better performance than the Maxent model for pre-
dicting  species  distribution  (Mi  et  al.,  2017).  However,  this  does  not 
mean that the RF model is better than the Maxent model. Each model has

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no mention of which specific platform or cloud service provider was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was utilized.
