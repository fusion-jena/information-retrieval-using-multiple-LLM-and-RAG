et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

identify which of the candidate sounds are vocalizations of the desired 
species (e.g. Rycyk et al., 2022).

mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

technique. For example, Cole et al. (2022) recently evaluated BirdNET 
for detecting 13 bird species in North America and found that the recall 
rate  ranged  from  9%  to  68%.  Similarly,  the  recall  rate  obtained  by 
Tolkova et al. (2021) ranged between 11% and 71% for three common 
bird species. Previous research has claimed that the accuracy of BirdNET 
increases when analysing bird songs of species that BirdNET was more 
familiar with (Arif et al., 2020). The Eurasian bittern is a widespread 
species, with over 900 recordings uploaded to Xeno-canto database and 
the Macaulay library of sounds, which may have contributed to the high 
recall  obtained  when  using  BirdNET  with  that  target  species.  We  are 
aware that we did not verify BirdNET detection, and therefore cannot 
rule  out  some  false  positives  (mislabelled  vocalizations)  within  the 
BirdNET  output. However,  no BirdNET  detection occurred  within  the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that there are mainly three settings that can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold. These were set to 1.5, 1.5 seconds, and 0.4, respectively.
