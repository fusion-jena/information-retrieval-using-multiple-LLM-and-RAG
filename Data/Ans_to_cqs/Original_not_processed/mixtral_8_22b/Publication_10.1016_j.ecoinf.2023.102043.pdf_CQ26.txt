3.2.2. Transfer learning based on YAMNet 

The second algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a 
deep neural network, i.e. YAMNet, which is pre-trained on data coming 
from 521 classes. Interestingly, YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convo-
lution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus (Shor 
et  al.,  2020).  Towards  using  YAMNet,  the  audio  data  is  processed  as 
follows:  

1.  The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 

16 kHz.  

2.  The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 

25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.  

3.  The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel 

scale within the range of 125–7500 Hz.  

4.  Finally, the algorithm is applied and its outcome is passed to YAMNet 

model for extracting the embeddings.

Therefore, the recording campaign was planned to last an entire year so 
as  to  capture  the  variations  that  goat  vocalizations  demonstrate 
throughout  the  year.  Overall,  we  have  collected  approximately  10  M 
sound  events  lasting  more  than  34,000  h.  Fig.  7  illustrates  the  data 
distribution per farm in terms of number of audio files, annotations and

model for extracting the embeddings. 

These are pulled from YAMNet and then fed as input to a sequential 
and  a  reduce  mean  layer  mapping  to  the  classes  mentioned  above 
(Ntalampiras et al., 2021). At this point, the final layers of the network 
map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels as shown in Fig. 5.

The  dataset  presented  in  Section  3.2  was  divided  into  70%  for 
training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. The division 
was  kept  the  same  when  experimenting  with  RF  and  YAMNet-based

Since  the  available  files  are  of  different  lengths,  we  employed  a 
sliding window with an overlap of 50% so that it was possible to divide 
the available audio into fragments of the same size during both training 
and testing. The overlap was required in order not to lose potentially 
important information existing on the edges of the window. On top of 
that, there are a plethora of cases where more than one classes exist in a 
single file as outputted by the AAD algorithm. The highest performance 
was obtained with a sliding window lasting 2 s. As regards the RF, the 
number of trees was set equal to 500 after an optimization phase con-
sisting  of  a  grid  search  within  the  set  {5,10,25,50,100,500,1000}. 
Interestingly, the algorithm’s predictions are used to count the number 
of bleatings existing in a specific audio file towards characterizing their 
activities.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some aspects of the process could be interpreted as addressing potential biases. For instance, the use of a sliding window with an overlap of 50% ensures that important information is not lost due to edge effects, which might otherwise introduce a bias towards certain features. Additionally, the fact that the dataset is divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes suggests a balanced approach to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. Nevertheless, without further details about the distribution of classes in the dataset or specific measures taken to handle class imbalance, it cannot be definitively stated what techniques were used to address data bias.
