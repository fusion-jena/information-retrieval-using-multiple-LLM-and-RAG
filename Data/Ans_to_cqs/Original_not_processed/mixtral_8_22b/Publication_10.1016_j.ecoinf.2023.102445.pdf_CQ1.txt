input into the model network for training.

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

neural  network  (CNN).  It  encapsulates  three  operations,  Conv2d 
convolution,  BatchNorm2d  and  an  activation  function,  which  can 
effectively extract and learn useful feature information from the input 
data and provide more expressive input for the subsequent layers of the 
neural network. The C2f module is used for multilevel deep processing 
and abstraction of input features to construct the backbone network of 
CSPDarknet53 (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020), and its design is inspired by 
the  C3  module  and  Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (ELAN)  to 
realize additional cross-layer connections across branches. This design

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of 
pest  detection  and  counting  research  using  deep  learning.  However, 
further exploration is still needed. Jinhui She et al. introduced the ECA 
attention mechanism into the YOLOv5s model to improve the precision 
of trap bottle detection and counting (She et al., 2022). However, there 
was  still room for further reduction in the size of the model. In their 
comparison of the effects of different deep learning methods on insect 
counting tasks, Ioannis Saradopoulos et al. concluded that YOLOv7/8 
generally  provided  the  best-embedded  solution  (Saradopoulos  et  al., 
2023). These findings serve as a reference for selecting the basic model 
in this paper. Tiewei Wang et al. proposed an improved recognition and 
counting approach based on deep learning with data reorganization and 
high detection and counting accuracy (Wang et al., 2022); however, the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific method or source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined what methods are utilized for gathering raw data based solely on the provided text. Typically, in deep learning pipelines, raw data collection may involve various sources such as surveys, sensors, cameras, microphones, public datasets, etc., depending on the application and requirements of the project.
