artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.

MSI is the sole data source that incorporates three bands in the red-edge 
range. This characteristic holds significant importance for monitoring 
the  water  quality  of  lakes.  Currently,  the  inversion  of  water  quality 
parameters typically involves the use of visible and near-infrared bands. 
For instance, chlorophyll inversion commonly employs a ratio algorithm 
using  the  blue  and  green  bands  (Yepez  et  al.,  2024),  while  CDOM 
inversion typically utilizes the blue and violet bands (Cao et al., 2024). 
Suspended particle inversion often employs a three-band model, incor-
porating near-infrared bands (Heng et al., 2017). Therefore, a compar-
ative analysis was conducted across four bands. In this study, the MSI 
and OLCI sensors were selected for comparative analysis in four visible

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., used within the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various algorithms and models employed for satellite image processing and atmospheric correction, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model. It also mentions the use of different sensors like Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI for comparative analysis. Unfortunately, without further information regarding the deep learning pipeline utilized in this work, I cannot provide details on the exact data augmentation techniques applied.
