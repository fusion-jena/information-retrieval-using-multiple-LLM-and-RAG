Abstract: Farm dams are a ubiquitous limnological feature of agricultural landscapes worldwide.
While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large
effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown
in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artiﬁcial intelligence and remote sensing data to
address this critical global information gap. Speciﬁcally, we trained a deep learning convolutional
neural network (CNN) on high-deﬁnition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the
ﬁrst continental-scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in
Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km2)
and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales

2.4. Statistical Analyses

We used Python [35] and fastai [30] for developing the deep learning CNN. We used
R [36] for all statistical analyses, using packages sf [37] and raster [38] for data manipulation;
ggplot2 [39], rasterVis [40] and cowplot [41] for plotting. We also used R for designing
the website AusDams.org, using Shiny [42], Leaﬂet [43], Plotly [44] and using Joe Cheng’s
Superzip template (https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html).

3. Results
3.1. Reported Farm Dams

There were 1,694,675 farm dams reported by regional and Federal authorities in
Australia. The majority of farm dams were in New South Wales (37%), Victoria (26%),
Queensland (17%) and Western Australia (10%; Table S1). Around three-quarters of Aus-
tralia recorded at least one dam per 2000 km2, but the typical density near urban centres
was 2–5 farm dams per km2 (Figure 2). The average size of a dam was ca. 1000 m2, ranging
from 100 m2 to >105 m2 (Figure 3).

3.2. Data Veriﬁcation

We trained a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect farm
dams using the Python-based open-source library “fastai” version 1 https://github.com/
fastai/fastai; [30]. We downloaded the most recent (typically between 2018 to 2019) RGB
satellite image of 7362 Australian locations from three different repositories (i.e., http://
ecn.t3.tiles.virtualearth.net, https://api.mapbox.com and https://server.arcgisonline.com).
We sampled 75% of these images from our dam dataset and the remaining 25% from
randomly selected locations within Australia. These satellite images had varying sizes and
aspect ratios, and the pixel resolution was mostly 0.45 m, but when unavailable, we also
used lower resolutions (e.g., 1–5 m).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the authors used the Python-based open-source library "fastai" version 1 for training the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). This suggests that the code might be based on or related to the FastAI library. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository. It could potentially be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but this remains speculative until confirmed by additional sources or documentation.
