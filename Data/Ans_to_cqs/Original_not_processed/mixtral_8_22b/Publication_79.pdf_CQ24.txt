Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value for reproducibility purposes. This ensures that the same results can be obtained when running the code multiple times. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results or select the best performing model based on validation metrics. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by providing more robust estimates of performance. In terms of specific implementation details, some popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in functions for setting random seeds across various components of the pipeline, including data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. Overall, managing randomness is crucial for ensuring reliable and consistent results in deep learning applications.
