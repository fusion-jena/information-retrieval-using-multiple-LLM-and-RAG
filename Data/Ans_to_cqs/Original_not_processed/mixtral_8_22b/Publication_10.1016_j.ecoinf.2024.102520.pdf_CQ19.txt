The outputs of the Land Use and Land Cover studies (LULC) based on 
the  Geographic  information  system  (GIS)  indicate  that  agricultural 
(30%), horticultural (40%), and forest land (about 16%) uses account 
for >86% of the total area of the region studied. The remaining area 
includes  wastelands,  ravine  streams  and  urbanized  sites.  The  land 
mostly  consists  of  mountains  and  valleys.  The  river  Jhelum  and  its 
tributaries are the principal irrigation supplies. In the northwest part of 
the  study  area is  located the  Wular Lake,  the  Asia biggest freshwater 
lake. The native vegetation in the region includes Pinus spp., Fir spp., 
Citrus spp., Salix spp., Populus spp., and Ulmus spp.. The Indian gov-
ernment  has  prohibited  deforestation  in  the  region  because  of  its 
extreme vulnerability (Bashir et al., 2022). Fig. 1 provides an illustrative 
map of the area studied.
