feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Percent  contribution  and  permutation  importance  are  two  metrics 
provided by MaxEnt to determine the importance of input variables in 
the final model (Phillips, 2005). The percent contribution measures the 
contribution of each variable to the model as a percentage of the total 
contribution of all variables. The permutation importance measures the 
decrease  in  training  AUC  for  each  variable  when  the  values  of  that 
variable are randomly permuted among the training points. We identi-
fied the variables that had high percent contribution and permutation 
importance scores as key variables. We then compared the characteris-
tics  of  these  key  variables  between  potential  and  non-potential  areas 
using violin plots.

the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, which is often used in species distribution modeling. This method involves optimizing a function to find the probability distribution that maximizes entropy subject to constraints based on observed data. Regularization methods are also mentioned, specifically setting the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5, which helps prevent overfitting during the optimization process. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is utilized to select the best tuning parameters, which is a common technique for model selection in statistical learning.
