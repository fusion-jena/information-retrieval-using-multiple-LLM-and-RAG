average  temperatures.  Then,  we  averaged  a  subset  of  the  monthly 
average  temperatures  (1970–2000)  to  obtain  12  datasets  valid  for 
1970–2000, one for each month.

over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the sources cited that the authors may have used publicly available datasets such as WorldClim 2 (Fick & Hijmans, 2017) or other climate databases like those mentioned in Hopkinson et al. (2012). These datasets often contain historical temperature records collected through various means such as weather stations, satellites, or other remote sensing technologies. Additionally, some studies might involve fieldwork to collect localized data using sensors or manual measurements. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the study design or methodology, it is impossible to definitively state which methods were employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
