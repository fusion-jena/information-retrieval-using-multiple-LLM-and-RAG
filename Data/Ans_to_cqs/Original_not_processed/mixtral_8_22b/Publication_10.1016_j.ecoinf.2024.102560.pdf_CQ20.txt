racy. Aksoy et al. (2022) analyzed the performance of three different 
machine-learning  algorithms  to  map  soil  salinity  for  the  Urmia  Lake 
basin  using  Landsat-8  OLI,  Sentinel-2A  satellite  images,  and  ground- 
based  EC  measurements.  The  output  soil  salinity  map  demonstrated 
the most reliable spatial distribution of various soil salinity classes in the 
selected study area.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were used for training these models based solely on this context.
