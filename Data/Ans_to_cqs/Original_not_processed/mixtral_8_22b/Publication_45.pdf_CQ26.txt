In the training phase of a DNN the connection weights (w in 
Figure 1) between neurons are iteratively updated by a training 
algorithm  to  minimize  the  prediction  error  over  the  training 
data  set  (see  Supplementary  Material  S2  for  more  details). 
In  order  to  gauge  the  accuracy  of  predictions  for  new  input 
data  (i.e.,  data  not  used  during  training),  the  available  data  is 
frequently split into a training data set (used for training), and 
a test data set. The details of the network architecture, such as 
the  size  of  the  network,  the  selection  of  specific  layer  types, 
and parameters of the training process strongly determine the 
prediction  accuracy  of  the  network  and  are  usually  problem 
specific. More information on deep learning is available in e.g.,

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used in general include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to create the training and testing datasets. This ensures that both sets have roughly the same distribution of classes or features.

Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing examples or creating synthetic ones using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by removing examples, either randomly or according to certain criteria.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of data points representing different scenarios, conditions, or populations to reduce potential biases caused by underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups.

These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve model performance, but they should be applied carefully considering their potential drawbacks and limitations.
