error < 11%, high prevalence (>43%) and sensitivity higher than 86% 
(Table 2). In all classified maturity stages, the specificity was higher than 
85%.

In addition to the OOB, the model performance was also evaluated 
using  the  confusion  matrix  with  the  following  metrics:  Cohen’s  kappa 
coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements (Cohen, 1960), 
Precision to determine proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for 
the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true 
negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the 
proportion  within  each  phase.  Descriptions  of  these  metrics  are  as 
follows: 

κ =

2 × (TP × TN (cid:0) FN × FP)
(TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN)

On each sampled fish, the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) was computed 
as  GSI  = (OW  /  (TW  -  OW))  × 100.  In  addition,  a  measurement  of 
relative condition factor (Krel) was calculated as an indirect measure of 
nutritional status in according to Le Cren (1951), as Krel = TW / (αTL
),

when sampling the fundamentally different population conditions of a 
healthy  versus depleted  stock. The use of  RFs has the  potential to  be 
applied for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attri-
butes  are  essential  for  their  management  and  conservation  in  the 
ecosystem. Machine learning methods may offer an accurate alternative 
to traditional methods to improve our biological understanding in future 
or retrospective research.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest Classification, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. Typically, in such algorithms, training is stopped based on certain criteria like early stopping or when the error rate reaches a minimum threshold. In some cases, training might continue until the maximum number of trees is reached or if the out-of-bag (OOB) error stops improving significantly. Unfortunately, without more specific details regarding the training process, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
