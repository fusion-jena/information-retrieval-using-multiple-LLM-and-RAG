Fig. 3. Average daily number of vocal animals successfully tracked throughout the sample period with a 10 day moving average for 2010 sample year (top) and 2011 
sample year (bottom). The total line represents all song detections that could be localised, while the milling and directional lines indicate those detections that were 
attributed to a track, with the movement patterns of vocalising animals inferred based on track appearance. The x tick represents the first day of the labelled month. 

Fig. 4. Tracks of vocalising animals within the vicinity of the acoustic receiver array where each grid square represents 25 km2  and the x and y axis represent 
distance from the central point of the receiver array. Left column from top: 4th February 2010, and 11th February 2010. Right column: 14th February 2010 and 2nd 
March 2010.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized for this purpose.
