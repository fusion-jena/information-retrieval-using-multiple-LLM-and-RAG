Herbarium sheet images are usually of high resolution to capture the ﬁne-grain details
of the specimens. As a standard procedure for training deep learning models, all input
images together with their annotation were resized to a 512 × 512 resolution to reduce
the computational cost during training. Rotation, ﬂipping, and brightness adjustments
were applied as augmentation techniques for better network generalization. We used
DeepLabv3+ as the segmentation model with ResNet-101 as the feature extractor. This
model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on the dataset. This is
useful as earlier layers of the network tend to learn generic features and therefore become
useful for other computer vision tasks [49]. We applied an Adam optimizer with a learning
rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 3. The model was trained for 100 epochs with a binary
cross-entropy loss function as we had a binary class problem (leaf or background).

is an improvement in the previous version by adding an effec-tive decoder module to improve the boundaries of the segmentation results [41]. Further-more, apart from ResNet-101, an Xception model can be used as a feature extractor while applying a depth-wise separable convolution to both ASPP and the decoder module, hence improving the speed and robustness of the encoder-decoder network.

Phase 2: Leaf Extraction Using Connected Component A classic connected component algorithm was first introduced by Azriel and John in 1966 [42]. Since then, numerous different implementations have been proposed for im-proving existing ones [43]. In image processing, connected components analysis helps to

kernel to expand without increasing the number of parameters [39]. This expansion of the
window is controlled by the dilation rate and it enables the network to capture information
from a larger receptive ﬁeld of view with the same parameters and computational complex-
ity as the normal convolution. The combination of spatial pyramid pooling with Atrous
convolutions resulted in an efﬁcient multi-scale processing module called Atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP). In the earlier version (DeepLabV3) [40], the last ResNet block of
the modiﬁed ResNet-101 uses different Atrous convolutions with different dilation rates.
ASPP, together with bilinear up sampling, is also used on top of the modiﬁed ResNet block.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the DeepLabv3+ model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on another unspecified dataset. Therefore, one of the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. However, the specific dataset used for fine-tuning the model is not mentioned in the given context.
