In recent years, the advancement of artificial intelligence technology 
has  led  to  the  emergence  of  numerous  deep  learning  algorithms, 
including U-Net (Unet), Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet), and 
DeepLabV3+,  which  are  increasingly  applied  to  address  geographical 
and ecological challenges (Çalıs¸kan, 2023a; Chen, 2023; Minaee et al., 
2022). Notably, Unet  exhibits proficiency  in achieving  more accurate 
results by requiring a smaller number of training samples (Ronneberger 
et  al.,  2015).  On  the  other  hand,  Pspnet  employs  a  spatial  pyramid 
module  to  gather  contextual  data  from  diverse  regions,  enabling  the 
acquisition  of  comprehensive  global  information  (Zhao  et  al.,  2017). 
DeepLabV3+ integrates an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) 
architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, effectively merging 
multi-scale information. This integration aids in precise object boundary

DATAID=217).  Both  climate  and  DEM  data  were  resampled  to  10  m 
spatial resolution through ArcGIS. Mean groundwater data from April to 
September, featuring a 10 m resolution, were derived from a Machine 
Learning  model  constructed  based  on  groundwater  monitoring  data 
collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin (model details 
can be referenced in Liu et al., 2022b).

Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) is an essential indicator that captures variations in vegetation and doc-
uments the impacts of climate change and human activity for environmental assessment. However, conventional 
methods encounter challenges in accurately extracting fine-scale FVC in drylands due to the vegetation distri-
bution being very heterogeneous in space with patches and inter-patches. Using the lower Tarim River Basin as a 
typical study case, we investigated three deep convolutional neural networks—Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3 +
—to generate high-precision FVC in drylands with high-resolution (0.8 m) remote sensing images. Among these 
models,  the  Unet  model  performed  better,  with  an  accuracy  of  93.38%,  while  the  accuracy  of  Pspnet  and 
Deeplabv3+ was 88.14% and 88.91%, respectively. Comparison with the FVC derived from normalized differ-
ence vegetation index (NDVI),  and land use/land cover data  from ESRI and ESA indicated that  the FVC map

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that mean groundwater data was derived from a machine learning model constructed based on groundwater monitoring data collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin. Additionally, high-resolution (0.8m) remote sensing images were used to investigate the performance of different deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the collection of raw data may involve various methods such as sensor-based monitoring systems (for example, water level sensors or satellite imagery) and publicly available datasets (like those from ESRI and ESA). Nonetheless, without further context, it is impossible to determine the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular scenario.
