2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen 
(cid:0) 6 showing 
from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with and 10

A.1b),  with  high  performances  (e.g.,  f1-score  values  above  93.09%; 
Table  4).  Unlike  the  training  task,  the  best  results  were  obtained  by 
(cid:0) 4,  in  terms  of  accuracy 
EfficientNetB0  with  a  learning  rate  of  10
(97.50%),  sensitivity  (96.00%)  and  f1-score  (97.46%),  followed  by 
(cid:0) 4),  which  also  showed 
Inception-v3  with  the  same  learning  rate  (10
high accuracy (96.88%), sensitivity (94.00%), specificity (99.75%) and 
f1-score (96.78%). In the case of the EfficientNetB0 model, only 4% of 
the  images  displaying  the  Cortaderia  selloana  were  confused  by  the 
model as showing no C. selloana (false negatives; Fig. A.1c). Likewise, 
from  the  images  showing  no  C.  selloana,  in  1%  of  the  cases  Effi-
cientNetB0  incorrectly  predicted  the  class  “With  Cortaderia  selloana” 
(false  positives;  Fig.  A.1d).  A  similar  pattern  was  verified  for  the 
remaining CNNs (see confusion matrices in Tables A.6 and A.7).

To  enhance  the  performance  of  our  classification  and  detection 
models  while  also  avoiding  overfitting,  we  increased  the  size  of  the 
training dataset through a data augmentation approach. This approach 
involves  artificially  increasing  the  diversity  of  a  dataset  by  applying 
various transformations to the existing data samples, such as rotation, 
flipping, or cropping. These transformations modify the appearance of 
the  original  images,  thereby  creating  new  variations  that  can  help 
improve the model’s ability to generalize across different scenarios and 
conditions.  Specifically,  for  the  classification  models,  we  used  four 
transformations  per  image  that  were  selected  considering  the  visual 
characteristics  of  plant  species,  as  well  as  the  typical  properties  of 
citizen-science and  social media images.  An  example of such was  the 
adoption of the horizontal flipping instead of the vertical flipping, as the

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors have mentioned using a data augmentation approach to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios and conditions. However, they did not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on common practices in computer vision tasks, it is reasonable to assume that some commonly used data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping might have been employed.

Final Answer:
Although the paper does not explicitly state the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that common techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping were utilized.
