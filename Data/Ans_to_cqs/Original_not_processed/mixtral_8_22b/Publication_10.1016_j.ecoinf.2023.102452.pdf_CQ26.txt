When  dealing  with  a  large  number  of  input  variables,  especially 
when using SAMs that require evaluating the best options, it becomes 
crucial to have a robust and efficient method for selecting suitable in-
puts.  While  some  studies  have  explored  this  area,  further  research  is 
needed  to  develop  novel  and  efficient  approaches  that  effectively 
address this challenge (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Mazarei Behba-
hani and Mazarei, 2023; Wang et al., 2023).

systems (Lee et al., 2020; Nevo et al., 2022). Streamflow forecasting is 
also  crucial  for  water  resources  management,  enabling  us  to  operate 
dams and prevent ecosystem damage (Santos et al., 2023). Obviously, 
streamflow (i.e.,  rainfall-runoff)  models are  the  essential parts of  any 
flood or drought warning system (Zhu et al., 2019). Numerous proced-
ures have been used to develop forecasting models, among which data 
driven methods, also known as the black-box models, have gained more 
attention in recent years (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Everaert et al., 
2013; Mazarei Behbahani and Mazarei, 2023; Minaya et al., 2018; Singh 
et al., 2023; Zamani et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the importance of having a robust and efficient method for selecting suitable inputs when dealing with a large number of input variables, particularly when using Self-Adaptive Models (SAMs) that require evaluating the best options. This suggests that addressing data bias through appropriate preprocessing techniques would indeed be important in ensuring accurate results from these models.

In general, stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the size of the minority class by duplicating examples, while undersampling reduces the size of the majority class by removing examples. These techniques help balance datasets and reduce bias towards the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources to ensure representation of all possible scenarios, reducing potential biases introduced by limited data sources.

While the provided context does not directly discuss these techniques, they remain relevant considerations for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Further research may explore how these techniques could be integrated into the development of novel and efficient approaches for handling large numbers of input variables in self-adaptive models.
