Among the five MLMs evaluated, the AUC analysis revealed that RF 
and SVM performed remarkably well with training AUC values of 0.868 
± 0.002 and 0.857 ± 0.001, respectively. MARS followed this, and BRT 
gained  training  AUC  scores  of  0.829  ± 0.001  and  0.809  ± 0.002, 
respectively,  while  CART  exhibited  poor  performance  with  a  low 
training AUC of 0.781 ± 0.001. Similar trends were observed for TSS, 
where  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT  outperform  CART  (Table  3).  All  models 
exhibited  robust  agreement  with  the  predicted  results  in  terms  of  ac-
curacy.  Additionally,  when  considering  the  kappa  and  phi  for  recog-
nizing  accurate  forest  fire  pixels,  all  models,  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT 
outperformed CART (Table 3). The Δ  AUC was lowest for CART with 
0.002, followed by MARS and BRT with both values of 0.003. The Δ AUC 
was  highest  for  RF  and  SVM  with  the  values  of  0.022  and  0.021,

various fire datasets (Sayad et al., 2019). In recent times, support vector 
machines (Jaafari and Pourghasemi, 2019), neural networks (Li et al., 
2020),  kernel  logistic  regression  are  benchmark  classifiers  (Tien  Bui 
et  al.,  2016),  and  hybrid  artificial  methods  (Jaafari  et  al.,  2019)  like 
random  forest  (Bustillo  S´anchez  et  al.,  2021;  Cao  et  al.,  2017)  have 
gained  popularity  in  fire  prediction  studies.  Other  emerging  machine 
learning models are also used globally to predict forest fire risk zonation 
(Abid, 2021). However, each MLM has several pros and cons; therefore, 
model ensembling is the second step in improving the predictive ability 
of forest fire susceptibility in large-scale studies (Gigovi´c et al., 2019; 
Tuyen et al., 2021). Ensemble approaches are often considered better 
than  single  models  because  they  improve  predictive  performance, 
reduce overfitting, and provide more robust and reliable results (Ganaie

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study focuses on forest fire susceptibility using various machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). These models typically use structured data formats such as CSV or tabular data containing features related to forest fires. It is important to note that the context does not discuss any deep learning techniques but rather emphasizes traditional machine learning models. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined if the study uses other data formats such as images, videos, or audio files in its deep learning pipeline.

Based on the context, it appears that the study primarily utilizes structured data formats such as CSV or tabular data for input into their machine learning models. However, further clarification would be needed to confirm whether the study employs different data formats in a potential deep learning pipeline.
