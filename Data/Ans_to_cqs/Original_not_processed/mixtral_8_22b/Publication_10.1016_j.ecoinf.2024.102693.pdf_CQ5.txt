2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.

2.2. Transformer-like model

The  selected  CNN-like  model  was  ResNet-50  (He  et  al.,  2016),  as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). It comprises four stages, each containing three, four, 
six, and three blocks, with each block consisting of three convolutional 
layers. In addition, there is an independent convolutional layer at the 
start of the network and a fully connected layer at the end for classifi-
cation, resulting in 50 layers.

We compared the performance of our method with those of previous 
studies using the IP102 dataset, as shown in Table 3. This table presentes 
the  results  of  both  the  single  models  and  ensemble  methods.  By 
comparing the four basic models in Table 2 with the single models in 
Table  3,  it  is  evident  that  our  trained  basic  models  demonstrated 
impressive performances on the IP102 dataset. For example, our trained 
ResNet-50 exhibited a remarkable improvement of approximately 20% 
in accuracy compared to the results reported by Wu et al. (2019), and 
our  trained  ViT-S/16  outperformed  the  larger-scale  AA-Trans  (Wang 
et al., 2023). This notable enhancement can be primarily attributed to 
the implementation of advanced deep transfer-learning strategies and 
the incorporation of multiple data augmentation techniques. Moreover, 
the performance of Volo-d1 exceeded that of some larger-scale single 
models  and  ensemble  methods.  This  observation  highlights  the

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.
