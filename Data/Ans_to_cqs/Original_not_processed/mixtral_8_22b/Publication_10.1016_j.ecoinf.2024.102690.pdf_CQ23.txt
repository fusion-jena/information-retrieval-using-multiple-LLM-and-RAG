Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

biodiversity. The habitat maintenance bundle accounted for 32% of the 
total area, mainly constituting woodlands, and was characterized by the 
highest delivery of biodiversity, water conservation, and raw materials, 
whereas it had a moderate delivery of other services.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific deep learning models or their application in this context. Therefore, I cannot provide details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. However, some common practices to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, applying data augmentation techniques, implementing regularization methods, employing transfer learning, and utilizing various validation schemes like cross-validation or stratified sampling.
