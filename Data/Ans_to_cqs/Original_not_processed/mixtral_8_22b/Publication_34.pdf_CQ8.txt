capacity: they have accumulated around three hundred thousand ﬁnely geolocated
plant species observations just in France during last decade. Citizen programs
in biodiversity sciences are currently developing worldwide. We expect them to
reach similar volumes of observations to the sum of national museums, herbaria
and conservatories in the next few years, while still maintaining a large ﬂow of
observations for the future. With good methods for dealing with sampling bias, those
ﬁne precision and large spatial scale data will make a perfect context for reaching
the full potential of deep learning SDM methods. Thus, NN methods could be a
signiﬁcant tool to explore biodiversity data and extract new ecological knowledge
in the future.

10.3.5 Evaluation Metrics

• CNN is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one last layer fully
connected with 200 neurons, exactly similar to previous ones. The ﬁrst layer is
composed of 64 convolution ﬁlters of kernel size (3, 3) and 1 line of 0 padding.
The resulting feature maps are batch-normalized (same normalization for every
pixels of a feature map) and transformed with a Relu. Then, an average pooling
with a (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride is applied. The second layer is composed of
128 convolution ﬁlters of kernel size (5, 5) and 2 lines of padding, plus Batch-
Normalization and ReLU. After, that a second average pooling with a (8, 8)
kernel and (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride reduces size of the 128 feature maps
to one pixel. Those are collected in a vector by a ﬂattening operation preceding
the fully connected layer. This architecture is not very deep. However, considered
the restricted number of samples, a deep CNN would be very prone to over ﬁtting.

10.3.2 Species Selection

For the genericity of our results and to make sure they are not biased by the choice
of a particular category of species, we have chosen to work with a high number of
randomly chosen species. From the 7626 initial species, we selected species with
more than 300 observations. We selected amongst those a random subset of 1000
species to constitute an ensemble E1000. Then, we randomly selected 200 species
amongst E1000 to constitute E200, and ﬁnally randomly selected 50 in E200 which

gave E50. E50 being the main dataset used to compare our model to the baselines, we
provide in Fig. 10.1 the list of species composing it. The full dataset with species
of E1000 contains 6,134,016 observations in total (see Table 10.1 for the detailed
informations per species).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not provide any details about the location or platform (such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket) where the code repository might be hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
