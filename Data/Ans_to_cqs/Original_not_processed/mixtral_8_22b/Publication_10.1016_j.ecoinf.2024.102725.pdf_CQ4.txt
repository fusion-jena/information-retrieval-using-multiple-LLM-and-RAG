NDVI data. Chu et al. (2021a) introduced an adaptive spatial-temporal
tensor completion method (ST Sensor) to fill gaps in the NDVI time se-
ries in cloud- and fog-prone areas. Chen et al. (2021) combined gap-
filling and an SG filter to reconstruct high-quality Landsat NDVI time
series data. These methods focused on algorithmic approaches to fill
missing periods or address weather-related occlusions in NDVI data,
successfully repairing and reconstructing missing data to achieve high-
quality NDVI dense-time-series reconstructions of MODIS and Landsat
data at the spatial scale (Chu et al., 2021b; Yao et al., 2023; Zeng et al.,
2021).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various studies related to NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover analysis using deep learning methods. Data augmentation is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc. Without explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context, we can only infer that they might have been employed due to their widespread usage in similar applications. For instance, Wei et al. (2016) discuss selecting the optimal NDVI time-series reconstruction technique for crop phenology detection, which could potentially involve data augmentation techniques like those mentioned above. Similarly, Benedetti & Rossini (1993) explore the use of NDVI profiles for agricultural statistics, where data augmentation may be beneficial. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence from the given context, this remains speculative.
