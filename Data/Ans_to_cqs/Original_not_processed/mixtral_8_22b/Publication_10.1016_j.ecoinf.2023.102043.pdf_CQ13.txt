3.2.2. Transfer learning based on YAMNet 

The second algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a 
deep neural network, i.e. YAMNet, which is pre-trained on data coming 
from 521 classes. Interestingly, YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convo-
lution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus (Shor 
et  al.,  2020).  Towards  using  YAMNet,  the  audio  data  is  processed  as 
follows:  

1.  The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 

16 kHz.  

2.  The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 

25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.  

3.  The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel 

scale within the range of 125–7500 Hz.  

4.  Finally, the algorithm is applied and its outcome is passed to YAMNet 

model for extracting the embeddings.

model for extracting the embeddings. 

These are pulled from YAMNet and then fed as input to a sequential 
and  a  reduce  mean  layer  mapping  to  the  classes  mentioned  above 
(Ntalampiras et al., 2021). At this point, the final layers of the network 
map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels as shown in Fig. 5.

The  dataset  presented  in  Section  3.2  was  divided  into  70%  for 
training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. The division 
was  kept  the  same  when  experimenting  with  RF  and  YAMNet-based

Thus, the YAMNet-based  classification algorithm was immediately 
put into production to assist in the finer annotation of the detected vo-
calizations as described in the following section. At the same time, the 
present  algorithm  is  updated  on  a  regular  basis  with  new  data  as 
extracted by the clustering process described in Section 4.3 in order to 
further improve its performance.

only  bleats  so  that  the  detection  algorithm  elaborates  on  the  specific 
audio structure alone. After constructing the initial dataset, we devel-
oped  two  solutions  for  detecting  goat  vocalizations:  a)  one  based  on 
handcrafted features and a traditional machine learning algorithm, and 
b)  one  relying  on  the  deep  network  YAMNet  designed  to  facilitate 
generalized sound recognition applications. 

3.2.1. Traditional machine learning 

In the first algorithm, the detection of goat vocalizations is based on a 
wide  variety  of  temporal  and  spectral  audio  features  (Mel-Frequency 
Cepstral  Coefficients,  Root  Mean  Square,  Spectral  Centroid,  Spectral 
Bandwidth, Spectral Rolloff, and Zero crossing rate (Alas et al., 2016; 
Ntalampiras  et  al.,  2020))  which,  after  early  experimentations,  have
