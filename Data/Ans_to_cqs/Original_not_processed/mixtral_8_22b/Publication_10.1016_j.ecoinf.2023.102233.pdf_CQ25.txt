Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

5. Conclusions 

Our study investigated the efficacy of active learning as a framework 
for  building deep  learning models  in a  setting  where  limited  training 
data were available and the cost to obtain training data was high. Using 
field  recordings  of  a  threatened  species,  the  southern  black-throated 
finch,  we  successfully  developed  and  demonstrated  the  value  of  an 
open  access  active  learning  method  that  considered  imbalanced  and 
unlabelled data and ambiguous vocalisations, which are common bar-
riers to constructing call recognition models for rare or cryptic species, 
and other species that vocalise infrequently. Our results demonstrate the 
utility of these methods in developing effective call recognisers for rare 
and difficult to survey species.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is designed for identifying or classifying calls of the southern black-throated finch. This is supported by the mention of "call recognition" and "identifying calls" in relation to the model. Additionally, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) suggests that the model is likely being used for image or signal processing tasks such as classification or object detection.
