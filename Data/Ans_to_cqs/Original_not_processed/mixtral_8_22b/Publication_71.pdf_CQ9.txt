including a NIR band in addition to the RGB bands. This is because in order to build a satisfactory
model, not only a lot of training data are needed that include the NIR band in addition to RGB color
images but also signiﬁcant GPU power that can conduct a proper training with batch sizes larger than 16.
This is because, for eﬃcient model training, larger batch sizes are recommended in DeepLabV3+ [49].
Moreover, the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is originally designed for three input channels, RGB,
needs to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate four-channel input images. With four-channel input
images, the existing pre-trained models, which are for RGB, cannot be used directly and there is a need
for training a model from scratch or at least modifying the DeepLabV3+ architecture such that only the
weights for the newly added image bands can be learned and the weights of RGB input channels can
be initialized by pre-trained model weights via transfer learning [41].

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine if it is available on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
