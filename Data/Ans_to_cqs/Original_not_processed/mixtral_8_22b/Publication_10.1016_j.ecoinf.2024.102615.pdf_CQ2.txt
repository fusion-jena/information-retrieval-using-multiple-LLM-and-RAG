2.4.2. Performance metrics and interpretation method of the model 

This  study  uses  the  correlation  coefficient  (R),  root  mean  square 
error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) coefficient of determination 
(R2), and mean relative error (MAE) metrics to confirm the prediction 
performance of the model on the validation set. R measures the linear 
relationship between two variables. Its value varies between (cid:0) 1 and 1, 
such that values closer to 0 denote a lesser correlation between the two 
variables,  indicating  improved  model  performance.  The  formula  for 
calculating R is as follows (Qi et al., 2018):

ment ranges were determined based on a review of existing literature 
(Chien, 1994; Peng et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2014; 
Wilson and Martinez, 2001; Zhang et al., 2019). The following hyper-
parameters  were  selected  to  optimize  the  MLP  network  architecture: 
number  of  neural  network  layers,  number  of  neurons  per  layer,  per-
centage values of the dropout layers, learning rate, and batch size. The 
specific tuning ranges of these hyperparameters are shown in Table 1. 
Each  set  of  parameters  in  Table  2  was  trained  based  on  a  set  of 
training data (80%) and verified using validation data (10%). The re-
sults of each group of parameters represent the average of ten experi-
ments (Tsimpouris et al., 2021), and the data were shuffled each time. 
Because the calculations are binary, the number of neuron nodes in the 
network architecture was set to the nth  power of 2 (Peng et al., 2022). In

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input layer has 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data. Spectral reflectance data typically refers to measurements of light reflected from a surface across different wavelengths or bands. This type of data can be represented in various formats such as numerical arrays or matrices, often stored in file formats like CSV, Excel, or HDF5. Therefore, we can infer that the input data format used in this deep learning pipeline is likely to be a structured numerical dataset, possibly in a CSV or similar format.
