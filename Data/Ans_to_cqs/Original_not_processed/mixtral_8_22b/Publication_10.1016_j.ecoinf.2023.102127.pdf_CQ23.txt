2.4. Model evaluation

Isaac et al. (2020). This is since (a) the consideration of all available data 
is  one of the  main points of  model-based integration, (b)  appropriate 
validation metrics are less straight-forward than for single datasets as 
biases and sampling methods can differ, and (c) any validation dataset 
might not represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated 
by  the  integrated  model.  For  example,  the  standard  practice  of  with-
holding parts of the training data for validating a model often means that 
both  training  and  testing  data  suffer  from  the  same  spatial  and  envi-
ronmental biases (Baker et al., 2022). If, however prior knowledge of the 
biology of a species is integrated in a SDM through a prior or offset, thus 
“nudging”  or constraining response functions towards a more sensible 
outcome  and  ultimately  different  prediction,  the  use  of  any  (biased) 
withheld data would likely indicate a reduced predictive performance

curate,  less  biased  representations  of  a  species  niche  while  also 
accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets.

are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will 
raise warnings and highlighted messages in case the provided informa-
tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it discusses challenges related to model evaluation and validation when integrating multiple datasets due to potential biases and differences in sampling methods. It suggests that using prior knowledge about a species' biology could help improve predictions by guiding response functions toward more realistic outcomes.

Regarding the issue of limited data availability for fitting complex models like those used in machine learning, the text mentions that the package will raise warnings if insufficient information is provided for inferring a species distribution. This implies that care should be taken to gather diverse and representative datasets to support reliable model development and evaluation.

While the text does not directly address techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, these strategies are commonly employed to enhance the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively training the model on different combinations of them, which helps prevent overfitting and provides insights into how well the model performs on unseen data. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset maintains the original class proportions, further improving the model's ability to generalize across various scenarios.
