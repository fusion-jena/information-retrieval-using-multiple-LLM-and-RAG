predictive efficiency, handle large datasets, and reduce training time. It 
is typically recommended for tabular datasets. LightGBM differs from 
other tree-based methods by implementing leaf-wise splits that create 
more  complex  trees,  which  are  more  efficient  in  reducing  loss  and 
resulting  in  higher  accuracy.  The  split  is  based  on  a  novel  sampling 
method named Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (Ke et al., 2017), in 
which data with small gradients are excluded, and the rest are used for

2.4. Hyperparameter optimisation 

Hyperparameter  optimization  searches  for  the  best  set  of  hyper-
parameters  for  a  machine  learning  model  that  can  perform  best  on  a 
given  task.  In  many  packages,  random  or  grid  search  is  the  default 
method  for  selecting  optimal  hyperparameters  (Snoek  et  al.,  2012). 
There are many studies on the selections of optimization algorithms for 
theoretical  problems  or  engineering  applications,  in  which  various 
versions  of  Bayesian  optimizers  and  Swarm-based  algorithms  were 
compared (Stenger et al., 2019; Stenger and Dirk, 2022).

As  machine  learning  models  have  been  increasingly  deployed  in 
critical applications, there may be a growing demand for interpretable 
and explainable hyperparameter optimization techniques. Methods that 
provide transparency and explainability in the hyperparameter tuning 
process  could  gain  importance  to  ensure  fairness,  accountability,  and 
transparency in developing machine learning models. Machine learning 
algorithms are considered robust classification and regression methods 
in which models are trained and learned from input data to improve the 
prediction of unseen data. However, the internal process is not under-
standable, as  it is  considered a  black-box stage. To  better understand 
interactions  between  features,  we  evaluated  several  performance  in-
dicators,  such  as  feature  importance,  feature  interactions,  and  contri-
butions of all features. The Shapley values provide a way to distribute

2. Data and methods 

The overall workflow of the proposed method is shown in (Fig. 1). 
For  simplicity,  the  workflow  starts  with  collecting  sample  plots  and 
image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, including on-field AGB 
and  independent  features.  This  data  set  is  fed  into  hybrid  models,  in 

which  Bayesian  optimizers  and  TDO  tune  the  hyperparameters  of 
XGBoost and LightGBM using RMSE as the objective function. The best 
model  (with  the  smallest  RMSE)  is  selected  to  estimate  AGB  for  the 
entire study area. This model was also interpreted to understand better 
what operates inside the ‘black box.’ More detailed descriptions of the 
study area,  data specifications and preparation, and  algorithm justifi-
cations are presented in the following sections.
