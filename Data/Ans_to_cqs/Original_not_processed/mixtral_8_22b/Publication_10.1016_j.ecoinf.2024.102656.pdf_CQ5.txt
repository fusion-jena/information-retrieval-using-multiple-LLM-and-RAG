Most  CA  networks  in  Iran  are  fragmented  by  roads,  and  road

Vegetation  variables  were  derived  from  the  red  and  near-infrared 
bands of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images captured in 
2019 at a spatial resolution of 30 m (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). The 
image  analysis  tool  in  ArcGIS  was  employed  to  calculate  normalized 
difference vegetation index (NDVI). To incorporate human influences, 
we generated distance maps for mines, mining roads, and settlements. 
Additionally,  distance  to  CAs  and  water  resources  was  calculated  to 
represent  landscape-level  safety  and  forage  resources,  respectively 
(Kaboodvandpour et al., 2021; Venter et al., 2015). All variables were 
formatted as rasters with a grid size of 100 m in ArcGIS v.10.4, ensuring 
a standardized and interoperable framework for subsequent analyses. 

2.4. Multicollinearity assessment

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide information about the use of any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which datasets were used in this case.
