An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information about a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, considering the general practices in machine learning and deep learning, one common approach to monitoring model performance during training is through validation techniques such as cross-validation or using separate validation sets. These strategies help evaluate how well the model is performing and whether it is overfitting or underfitting the training data. In addition, tracking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or loss functions are also commonly employed to assess the model's progress throughout the training process.
