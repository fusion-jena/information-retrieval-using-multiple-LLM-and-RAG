Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

tuning dataset is excluded from the training process. The model is then 
developed using the remaining dataset (i.e. the training dataset), and its 
performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average perfor-
mance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the 
performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyper-
parameters (Velasco Hererra et al., 2022). For this study, a value of 5 is 
assumed  for  k.  Grid  search  is  employed  to  evaluate  the  data-driven 
model’s  performance  using  each  combination  of  predefined  hyper-
parameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth 
of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning 
rate (which shows how fast the model learns) are tuned in this study as 
the influential hyperparameters (Cakiroglu et al., 2022).

The results showed the issue of overfitting in ML modelling, namely 
when the learning dataset used is relatively small. Some recent studies 
have  evaluated  model  performance  against  the  data  used  in  model 
fitting  and  tuning  (e.g.  Kucuk  and  Sevinc  (2023).  This  may  fail  to 
identify the true fit and behaviour of ML models, because ML models aim 
to  maximize  accuracy  against  the  model  development  (training  and 
tuning) dataset. Our model evaluation against an independent dataset 
revealed  true  model  fit,  which  in  our  case  was  10%  lower  than  that 
obtained against the model development dataset) in the best performing 
models and about 30% lower in the worst performing ones. Analysis of 
model behaviour also showed flawed behaviour in some models, such as 
non-monotonic trends that result from overfitting. The overfitting (i.e. 
where the model captures not only the trend but also the noise in the

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it appears that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is related to the use of k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, during each iteration of the k-fold cross-validation process, one group of data is held out as the tuning dataset while the remaining data is used for training. After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. This process is repeated for each fold, with the final performance metric being the average performance across all folds. However, the specific stopping criterion for training within each fold is not explicitly stated in the provided context. It could be based on various factors such as reaching a certain level of performance or convergence, or after a fixed number of iterations. Without additional information, it cannot be definitively determined what exact stopping criterion is used.
