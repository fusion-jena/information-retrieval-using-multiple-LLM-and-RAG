The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

Long-term land use P and N loss models often employ land use maps, 
soil maps, and other generic spatial datasets as inputs. The results of this 
work demonstrated that, in the extremely vulnerable NWH ecosystem, 
changes in land use impacted the spatial distribution of TSN and TSP. 
Thus,  the  quantification  of  these  changes  would  contribute  to  the 
regional  scale  P  and  N  transfer  models.  This  procedure  includes  an 
evaluation of soil and ecological variables related with such changes, 
which are preferably quantified from current databases as described in 
Fig. 3 that has been obtained by a kriging method using data collected 
from  the  field.  The  accuracy  of  any  spatial  prediction  is  critical  as  it 
determines  the  quality  of  the  interpolated  values.  In  this  work  the 
diagnostic measures of quality of spatial prediction were evaluated by
