Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To ensure the model’s robustness and generalization, we use a deeply 
supervised approach. Both the saliency maps S
generated at multiple 
levels and the final predicted saliency map Spre, are supervised during 
the model training. In training, the loss function is given by

where L is the number of saliency maps generated at multiple levels. As

3. Results 

We conduct comprehensive experiments based on ST-D to evaluate 

TrunkNet and compare it with a set of SOTAs. 

3.1. Implementation 

(cid:0) 8, (3) initial learning rate lr=1.0 × 10

We  also  conduct  a  comparative  analysis  of  total  training  time, 
average  inference  time,  model parameters,  and  FLOPs  between  Trun-
kNet and the other 10 SOTAs, aiming to evaluate the time and compu-
tational performance. The experimental results are presented in Table 5. 
Noticeably, TrunkNet is built entirely on the proposed MIF block that 

needs to be trained from scratch, so necessitates a longer training time in 
comparison to models built on pre-trained backbones. Since TrunkNet 
prioritizes competitive performance, there may be a limitation in terms 
of  time  efficiency.  However,  TrunkNet  achieves  an  average  inference 
time of only 58.41 ms per image, that is 17.12 frames per second (FPS), 
which  is  still  above  average.  Furthermore,  TrunkNet  showcases

of dilated convolution with various dilated rates to enlarge the receptive 
field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

In  the  feature  aggregation  part,  TrunkNet  first  generates  a  set  of 
saliency maps (marked with Si  in Fig. 4) under multilevel supervision; 
second, it aggregates all Si  into a single saliency map Fagg. Passing Fagg 
into a TA module, TrunkNet finally outputs Spre  as the prediction result. 

2.2.2. Multiscale information fusion (MIF) block 

We  design  the  MIF block,  the  basic  building  block  in  the  feature 

extraction stage, to simultaneously capture local and global information. 
According to Fig. 4, the MIF block involves three primary components: a 
texture attention (TA) module, a local-feature extractor, and a global- 
feature extractor.

Helpful Answer: After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Based on the provided context, here are some possible postprocessing steps for the described model:

1. Saliency Map Generation: During the training process, the model generates multiple saliency maps at different levels. These saliency maps highlight important regions or features within the input data. After training, these saliency maps can be used for further analysis or visualization purposes.

2. Final Predicted Saliency Map: Once the model has been fully trained, it produces a final predicted saliency map (Sp_re). This map represents the most significant areas or features identified by the model. It can be used for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection.

3. Loss Function Calculation: To measure the performance of the model during training, a loss function is employed. In this case, the binary cross-entropy loss function is utilized for both the multi-level saliency maps and the final predicted saliency map. By comparing the ground truth labels with the predicted output, the loss value indicates how well the model is performing.

4. Evaluation Metrics: To assess the overall effectiveness of the model, various evaluation metrics can be calculated. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. Depending on the specific application, appropriate metrics should be chosen to accurately reflect the model's performance.

5. Comparative Analysis: A comparative analysis can be conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model against state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs). This helps determine whether the new model outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy, speed, computational complexity, etc.

6. Time and Computational Performance: An assessment of the total training time, average inference time, model parameters, and floating point operations (FLOPs) can provide insights into the time and computational efficiency of the model. This information is crucial when deploying the model in real-world applications where resource constraints might exist.
