executed repetitively until it gives the successful result. It is also
possible for the user to retry the failed and/or unsuccessful task
manually [50]. Second, the failed task of agricultural pest
recognition is re-submitted to the same resource or another
mobile device for completing the software execution correctly
[47].

We are currently working on extending the number of
insect pest classes in our database, considering speciﬁc crops
either in the open ﬁeld or greenhouses. That will also support
the farmers to perform multi-class classiﬁcation of targeted
crop pests simultaneously, as presented in Ref. [51]. Moreover,
security and privacy algorithms of analyzed images [52,53] for
transmission over public mobile networks can be also involved
in the proposed cloud computing system , as shown in Fig. 4.
Nevertheless, the current version of our developed mobile-
based application is still valid and accurate to identify agricul-
tural pests successfully.

metrics for image-based classiﬁers. It is estimated by summa-
tion of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided
by all possible outcomes of classiﬁcation process, as given in
(3). Second, precision is given in (4) to represent relationship
between the true positive predicted values and all positive pre-
dicted values. Third, the sensitivity or recall in (5) presents the
ratio between the true predictive positive values and the sum-
mation of both predicted true positive and predicted false val-
ues. Finally, the fourth evaluation metric is F1-score, which
demonstrates the overall accuracy measure of the developed
classiﬁer by combining the double ratio of both the precision
and recall metrics in (6).

5.2. Results

Fig. 4 shows a sample of detection and classiﬁcation results
using the developed recognition system based on Faster R-
CNN. High classiﬁcation accuracy was achieved for all tested
images of insect pests in the range of 97.0 to 99.0%. Moreover,
the developed UI of our mobile application is depicted in
Fig. 5, monitoring the identiﬁcation results; for example, in

case of the ﬂea beetles with a summary including the suggested
pesticides such as Neem oil and insecticidal soaps for guiding
farmers.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include stopping training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, often referred to as early stopping or when the validation loss plateaus. Other methods may involve setting a fixed number of epochs or iterations, or manually inspecting the model's performance after each iteration. Without more specific details from the authors regarding their approach, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
