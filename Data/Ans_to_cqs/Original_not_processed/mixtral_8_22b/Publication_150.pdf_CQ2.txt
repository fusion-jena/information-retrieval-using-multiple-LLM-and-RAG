information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131 
was designed to be faster for mobile devices and thus has the fewest layers of the models compared here. The

Of the four models tested, InceptionV3 presents a good balance between performance and speed. InceptionV3 
had the highest precision and nearly matched Wide-ResNet’s accuracy and recall while being 39% (2.1 ms) faster 
(Table 1). Likewise, InceptionV3 was 5.8 percentage points more accurate than MnasNet while only 0.06 ms 
slower. The speed and accuracy of InceptionV3 makes it useful for web-based and mobile applications that rely 
on both speed and reliable predictions. We therefore focus on our InceptionV3 results for the remainder of this 
paper.

The InceptionV3 model nicely separated species into distinct groupings based on traits extracted from the 
model (Fig. 2). There was little overlap in two-dimensional trait space, which corresponds with the high degree 
of accuracy in the classification results.

The four CNN models we tested performed similarly. However, InceptionV3, with its relatively small size 
and complex architecture, presented a good blend of speed and accuracy. Although smaller models, such as 
MnasNet-A1, can be slightly faster, they can suffer from lower accuracy, recall, and precision, compared to 
InceptionV3. Potential end users of this classification model, i.e., those interested in characterizing bee com-
munities and monitoring population trends, would likely favor reliability over model speed and latency issues. 
However, speed is a factor in user satisfaction and will be important for future video-based applications of our 
model. Nevertheless, minimizing classification error is especially important when using crowdsourced data with 
inexperienced observers to monitor endangered species. For example, using error-prone data can over- or under-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the paper discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it can be inferred that the input data is most likely images. CNNs are primarily used for processing grid-like topology data, such as images, making them suitable for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
