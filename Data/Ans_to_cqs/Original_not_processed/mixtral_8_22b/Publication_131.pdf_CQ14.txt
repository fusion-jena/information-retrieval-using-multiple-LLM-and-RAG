ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).
Figure 11 shows the structure of the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of using techniques such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the provided context.
