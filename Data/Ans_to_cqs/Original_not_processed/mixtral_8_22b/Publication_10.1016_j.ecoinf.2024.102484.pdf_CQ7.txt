This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge, common practices include splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. However, without specific details from the given context, it is impossible to determine if these practices were followed or what exact criteria were used.
