%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in making accurate predictions or classifications based on the input data. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used in this case.
