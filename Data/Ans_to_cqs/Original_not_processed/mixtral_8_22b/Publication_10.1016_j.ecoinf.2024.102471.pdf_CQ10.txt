As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

network and outputs the probabilities of each audio sample belonging to 
different bird species. Then cross-entropy loss is back propagated, and 
weights of both the feed-forward neural network block and the wav2vec 
network are fine-tuned to understand the unique characteristics of bird 
calls of different species. Fig. 5 depicts the overall training process of the 
proposed methodology. 

3.1. Feature encoder

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.
