Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

included during the model training phase when introducing high-
frequency datasets. This is unsurprisingly as dataset size is often line-
arly related to number of regression trees required to build the models
(Biau and Scornet, 2016). This will enable the RF model to learn more
patterns
in the water quality datasets efficiently and improve
chlorophyll-a predictions. The most occurring max_depth when using
the manually sampled dataset was 28, which increased to 37 when more
datasets were used to train the model. Deeper trees in the continuous
high frequency data allows the model to learn intrinsic water quality
patterns. Less deep trees in the manually sampled datasets helps the
model to learn effectively with the few datasets without overfitting. The
inclusion of the chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable made
little impact on the parameter distribution for both RF_with_Sensor and
RF_w/o_Sensor (Fig. 5). This suggests that increasing predictor numbers

The significant parameters tuned to improve model performance are
the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree.
The kernel function aids in finding the nonlinear relationships in the
data without explicitly transforming it into a higher-dimensional space,
epsilon determines the width of the margin, C describes the penalty for
margin violation, and degree controls the complexity of the nonlinear
decision boundary (Ghosh et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model being discussed. However, we can infer from the context that the deep learning model is likely being used for regression tasks, specifically for predicting different algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, algal cells, and toxins. The context mentions machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) being used for these predictions. Additionally, the context discusses hyperparameters tuning for improving model performance, including the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree, which are relevant to regression tasks. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for regression purposes within this context.
