Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this information alone. However, it does mention that TensorFlow (<https://tensorflow.org>) was used to develop their species richness estimation model. This suggests that they might have utilized existing libraries and frameworks available within TensorFlow for building their deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without further details about the project or its authors, it would be impossible to provide a direct link to any potential code repositories related to this work.
