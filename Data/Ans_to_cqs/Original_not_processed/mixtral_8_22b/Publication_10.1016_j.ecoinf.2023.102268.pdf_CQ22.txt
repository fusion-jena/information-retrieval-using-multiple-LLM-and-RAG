similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

The  accuracy,  which  assesses  the  model's  ability  to  detect  both 
classes, is 98.0%. The precision, which measures the model's ability to 
classify boatwhistle calls, is 98.4%. These metrics are assessed as follows 
(Irizarry, 2020; Shah, 2023). 

accuracy = [TP + TN]/N

precision = TP/[TP + FP]

where  TP  and  FP  refer  to  the  number  of  true  and  false  positive  de-
tections, respectively. TN refers to the number of true negatives, and N is 
the total number of signals (Fig. 9). 

4.3. Application and utility

These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

Helpful Answer:

Two main metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: accuracy and precision. Accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of signals (N). This metric evaluates the model's ability to correctly classify both classes. Precision is computed as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). This metric measures the model's ability to accurately identify boatwhistle calls.
