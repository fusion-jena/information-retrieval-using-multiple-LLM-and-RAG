3.1. Dataset curation

aforementioned  CropAndWeed  dataset  (Steininger  et  al.,  2023)  con-
tained  a  total  of  43,814  plant  images,  but  only  8,034  images  were 
labeled. Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images from a va-
riety  of  maize  farmlands  for  the  maize  crops  and  associated  weeds. 
Despite the dataset scale, only 500 images were annotated with 5,764 
bounding box instances.

2. Public weed dataset survey 

Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic search in major 
databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE 
Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed 
database”,  “agriculture”,  “machine  vision”  and  “computer  vision”. 
Particularly,  to  facilitate searching  via  Google  Scholar,  the  Python  li-
brary “scholarly”3  was employed to automatically retrieve publication 
records. A total of 451 records were collected from the literature search,

In  addition  to  weed  images,  different  crops  were  also  captured  in 
some datasets (Gaidel et al., 2023; Madsen et al., 2020; Mylonas et al., 
2022; Steininger et al., 2023; Sudars et al., 2020). Sudars et al. (2020) 
presented a dataset consisting of 1,118 RGB images for 6 crops and 8 
weed species, with 7,853 bounding box annotations (441 annotations 
for  crops  and  7,442  for  weeds).  Images  were  captured  with  digital 
cameras in both controlled environments and field conditions. The Eden 
Library (Mylonas et al., 2022) consisted of 6,428 images captured by 
proximal  sensing  platforms  and  UAVs  (unmanned  aerial  vehicles)  in 
field conditions, for 15 crops and 9 weed species by a handful of imaging 
devices.  Emphasizing  on-field  image  diversity,  the  database  covered 
different crop health conditions involving 30 disorders, which can be 
beneficial for model robustness. Metadata was included in the database

Helpful Answer:
The paper mentions two main types of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for weed detection: bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image, such as plants or weeds. This technique is used in several studies mentioned in the paper, including those by Gaidel et al. (2023), Madsen et al. (2020), Mylonas et al. (2022), Steininger et al. (2023), and Sudars et al. (2020). For example, Sudars et al. (2020) presented a dataset containing 1,118 RGB images for six crops and eight weed species, with 7,853 bounding box annotations. Similarly, Steininger et al. (2023) used bounding box annotation for their CropAndWeed dataset, which contained a total of 43,814 plant images, although only 8,034 images were labeled.

Instance segmentation is another type of data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline for weed detection. Unlike bounding box annotation, which simply outlines the object of interest, instance segmentation provides more detailed information about each individual object within an image. It allows for precise identification and separation of overlapping objects, making it useful for complex scenes where multiple objects may overlap. However, the paper does not provide specific examples of studies using instance segmentation for weed detection.
