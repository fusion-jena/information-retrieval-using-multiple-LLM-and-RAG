where Xi
is the normalized value of i-th metric, represents the original 
value  of  the  i-th  metric,  Xi(cid:0) min  and  Xi(cid:0) max  are  the  minimum  and 
maximum value of i-th metric at baseline, respectively, P represents the 
final score, and wi  is the weight value of the i-th metric. 

Finally, the scores of all grids were aggregated to form the matrix, 
which was then utilized to construct a restorative map (Fig. 3). Given 
that the scores were computed with the central points of each grid, it 
becomes  necessary  to  estimate  the  restorative  potentials  for  the 
remaining regions using a statistical gap-filling technique (Jones et al., 
2017).  To  fulfil  this requirement,  the  study  adopted  the  interpolative 
shading approach and employed the shading function within MATLAB 
to estimate and map the restorative potential across the entire terrain 
area.

attributes are vital features of landscapes and play complementary roles, 
recent studies have integrated them for a comprehensive representation. 
For  example,  Qi  et  al.  (2022)  developed  3D  spatial  metrics  based  on 
point  cloud  to  quantify  landscape  attributes  of  volume  and  area,  di-
versity, shape, connectivity, colour, topography, and openness, enabling 
the possibility of correlating the metrics to four visual dimensions (i.e., 
naturalness, complexity, coherence, and visual scale) suggested by Tveit 
et al. (2006).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to ecology and landscape analysis, including 3D spatial metrics, landscape volumetric ratios, naturalness, and other factors. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model based on the given context.
