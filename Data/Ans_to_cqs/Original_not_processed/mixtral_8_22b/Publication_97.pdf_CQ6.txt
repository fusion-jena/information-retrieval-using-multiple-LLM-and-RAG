To tune the architecture of the neural network, we tested the following combinations of parameters
(Algorithm A1, line #24), which correspond to diﬀerent U-Net architectures: num_layers = {64, 32, 16},
depth = {2, 3, 4}, layer_rate = {2, 1.5, 1.2}, batch_norm = {True, False}, residual = {True, False}, dropout
= {0, 0.5}. Thus, we performed a grid search over 216 diﬀerent U-Net-like architectures and found
several of the best ones which are suitable for forest damage segmentation.

All of the best results corresponded to the conﬁguration when the number of layers was equal to
64, and dropout was applied. The best one, whereby an additional batch normalization is applied,
corresponds to the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm =
True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.

study states that good results for image classiﬁcation problems using CNN take place when the
batch normalization is applied after a 2D-convolutional layer. Since there are no reasons to put batch
normalizations right after the dropout layer (it doesn’t transform inputs and introduce a bias), we
placed it after each convolutional layer. There are still various possible extensions to the convolutional
block. The provided architecture (Algorithm A1, CONV_BLOCK) is the closest to the original U-Net
solution that incorporates both the batch normalization and residual connection. Another important
parameter in our CNN is layer rate. This parameter deﬁnes how the number of layers will change
depending on the depth of the neural network. Its default value is 2. This means that the number of
layers is multiplied by two each time we dive one level deeper through the U-Net architecture (for
classic U-Net, we have 64, 128, 256, etc., as the number of layers). Therefore, we can not only tune the

2.5. Neural Network Implementation and Tuning

The U-Net-like CNN described in Algorithm A1 was implemented in a Python-based (Python
3.7.3 was used) computational environment, which was built on top of the Keras framework [54] using
Tensorﬂow [62] as a backend. All computations were performed on a PC with 1 GPGPU Nvidia Tesla
K80 with 16 GB of RAM and required up to 10 h to train one CNN architecture.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, some common preprocessing techniques often employed in such scenarios include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range or distribution, typically between 0 and 1 or with zero mean and unit variance. Scaling refers to adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting their differences or losing information. Cleaning entails handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data points to improve the overall quality of the dataset. In this case, the authors mentioned applying batch normalization, which is a technique used during training to stabilize the learning process and reduce the risk of overfitting. They also utilized dropout regularization to further mitigate overfitting. These methods contribute to improving the performance and generalizability of the trained models.
