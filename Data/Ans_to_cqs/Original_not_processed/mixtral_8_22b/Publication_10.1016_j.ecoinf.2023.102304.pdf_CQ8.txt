%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include any details about a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of such a pipeline might be available, whether it be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or elsewhere. To provide an accurate response, additional context regarding the specific deep learning pipeline would be required.
