adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al., 
2022). All hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. 

2.5.1. Artificial neural networks

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

layers. ANNs require a substantial amount of training data to achieve 
effective learning. Among ANN architectures, the multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) neural network stands out as the most used.

Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN)  algorithms  simulate  human 
learning by establishing and strengthening connections between input 
and  output  data  (Campesato,  2020).  These  connections  enable  data 
linkage without the need for training data (Shen et al., 2021). Notable 
ANN algorithms include Radial Basis Function, Elman Recurrent, and 
Hopfield Neural Networks (Campesato, 2020; Domingues et al., 2020). 
However,  Multilayer  Perceptron  Neural  Networks  (MLPNNs)  using 
backpropagation  have  gained  popularity  and  were  employed  in  this 
study (Günlü and Ercanlı, 2020; Wang and Xing, 2008). MLPNNs consist 
of  input,  hidden,  and  output  layers,  each  with  interconnected  nodes 
(neurons) that transform input into output data (Wang et al., 2017). In 
this study, the input layer had 23 neurons, correlating with predictors. 
The  hidden  layer's  neuron  count  was  determined  using  training  and

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some optimization processes can be inferred.

For instance, during the training phase of the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), iterative error back-propagation adjusts connection weights until reaching a target minimal error. This process could be likened to gradient descent optimization methods, where the goal is to minimize the cost function by adjusting parameters based on the computed gradients.

Additionally, the text mentions that all hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. Grid search is a common technique used for hyperparameter optimization, which involves defining a set of possible parameter values and exhaustively trying all combinations to find the best one.

While these points do not directly address the use of specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, they suggest that optimization processes are indeed part of the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context.
