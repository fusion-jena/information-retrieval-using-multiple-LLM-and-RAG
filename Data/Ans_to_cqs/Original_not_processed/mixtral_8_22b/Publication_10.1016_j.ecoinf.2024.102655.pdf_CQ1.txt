2.2. Data pre-processing

The complete dataset of 42 WQPs (Appendix A) for the 13 moni-
toring sites was subjected to an outlier detection and artificial data
replacement process, as Casillas-García et al. (2021) reported. Processed
data were used subsequently to train machine learning models, first with

the full dataset of 13 monitoring sites and secondly with the best training
subset (BTS) composed of sites selected by CA and TSA. Predictions from
all models were evaluated by comparing the root-mean-square-error
(RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and
coefficient of determination (R2) and finally, the BTS-ANFIS was tested
against new data and individual data from each monitoring site. The
general procedure for the training data selection and model develop-
ment is described in Fig. 2.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing water quality parameters (WQP) using machine learning techniques. However, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this case. Generally speaking, when dealing with environmental studies like this one, researchers often use various types of sensors or probes to collect real-time data on water quality parameters such as pH levels, temperature, turbidity, etc. Additionally, they may also rely on manual sampling and laboratory testing to gather more detailed information regarding chemical composition and biological indicators. Public datasets can be another source of relevant data, but again, no mention has been made of their usage within this particular research project.
