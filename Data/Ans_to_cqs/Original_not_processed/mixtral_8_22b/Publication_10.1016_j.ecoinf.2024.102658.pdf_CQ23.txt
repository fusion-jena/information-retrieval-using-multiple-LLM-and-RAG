frequently in the best-performing feature set were retained for the final 
model  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024).  Random  and  spatial  CV  selected 
different feature sets, and these are compared in our final modeling and 
analysis,  under  the  names  ‘random-CV’  and  ‘spatial-CV’  features, 
respectively.  Lists  of  features  and  short  descriptions  are  presented  in 
Table 1. 

5.2.2. Feature scaling 

We tested both raw and scaled versions of features when modeling. 
Thus, there were four feature sets to fit per model type (raw random-CV 
features, scaled random-CV features, raw spatial-CV features, and scaled 
spatial-CV features).

The list of features. We utilize two feature sets selected through different CV 
processes  in  a  previous  study  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024),  which  we  name  the 
‘random-CV’ feature set and the ‘spatial-CV’ feature set, respectively. The two 
feature sets share six common features.

4.2.1. Baseline model: random forest 

Random forest (Breiman, 2001) utilizes an ensemble of classification 
or regression trees; each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of the 
training dataset, and represents a series of sequential decisions, in which 
each node of the tree is a binary split made on a predictive feature (e.g., 
whether  the  mean  annual  temperature  is  above  25 
C).  Further,  a 
random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at 
each node (we use a value of sqrt(n), n being the number of potential 
predictors, for the size of this subset). When used for classification, the 
outputs from the component trees are put through a majority vote to 
create a single output. This is known to be a simple but powerful method 
of retaining the complex non-linearity of decision trees while avoiding 
overfitting.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, R. Noda et al. employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized diverse datasets by selecting features using two different Cross-Validation (CV) processes - 'random-CV' and'spatial-CV'. These feature sets were derived from a previous study conducted by Mechenich et al. (2024). Secondly, they performed testing with both raw and scaled versions of features, resulting in four feature sets per model type. Lastly, they applied various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with different settings and prior distributions. However, it should be noted that the paper does not explicitly mention specific methods like stratified splitting or k-fold cross-validation.
