specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

algorithm to select ground water quality parameters. IVS algorithms can 
be  broadly  classified  into  three  main  categories:  Model-Free,  Model- 
Based, and Dimension Reduction methods. Model-Free IVS approaches 
utilize  statistical  techniques,  such  as  calculating  correlations  between 
inputs  and  outputs,  to  conduct  input  selection  (Ma  et  al.,  2022;  May 
et  al.,  2011a;  Mazarei  Behbahani  and  Mazarei,  2023).  Model-Based 
methods,  on  the  other  hand,  determine  the  best  inputs  through  the 
calibration process of the model (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Feng 
et al., 2017; May et al., 2011b; Snieder et al., 2019). Although Model- 
Based methods provide the advantage of simultaneously applying IVS 
and  the  model  with  acceptable  accuracy,  they  often  suffer  from 
computational inefficiency, limiting their practical application. Evolu-

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of Genetic Programming (GP) as a method for system identification of rainfall-runoff models and the utilization of the Eureka Pro software for GP modeling. Additionally, the text mentions the use of IVS (Input Variable Selection) techniques, which are important for improving the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. While these details do not directly address the query regarding measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, they suggest that the authors may have considered aspects related to model performance and generalizability during the development and implementation of their model. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it cannot be definitively stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
