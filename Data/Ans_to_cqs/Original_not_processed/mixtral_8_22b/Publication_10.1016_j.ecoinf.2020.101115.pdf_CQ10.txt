The MI's metadata repository, known as the Data Catalogue, is an
online infrastructure which supports the storage of datasets generated
by systems, programs, and individual researchers within the Institute
(Leadbetter et al., 2019). The Data Catalogue is operated through
Drupal, an open-source, web-based content management system.
Drupal enables database specialisation by permitting developers to
build custom ‘modules’, which are a set of instructions written for a
specific function. The database developed, named IFBA (Irish Fish
Biochronology Archive) is a self-contained module, that operates as an
extended feature of the MI Data Catalogue module. This system was
specifically designed for scales and otoliths, because they are, globally,
the most commonly collected and used biomineral structures from fish
used for aging purposes (Panfili et al., 2002). The system is flexible
enough to be adapted for any biological sample type (e.g. shells, corals,
