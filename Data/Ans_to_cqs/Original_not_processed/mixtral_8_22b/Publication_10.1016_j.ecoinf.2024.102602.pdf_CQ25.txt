2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen

the  images  displaying  the  Cortaderia  selloana  were  confused  by  the 
model as showing no C. selloana (false negatives; Fig. A.1c). Likewise,

remaining CNNs (see confusion matrices in Tables A.6 and A.7).

sum of the classification (loss of the classifier that determines the type of 
target object) and localization losses (loss of the regressor that generates 
a rectangular box to locate the target object), while the average infer-
ence time per image corresponds to the amount of time taken by the 
models to process a new image and make a prediction. Details on both

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in this context is primarily for classification tasks. Six pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0 - were selected due to their proven effectiveness in transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks. These models were trained using the Adam optimizer algorithm, a batch size of 10, and 100 epochs. The learning rates were determined through empirical trials. The goal of these models was to accurately classify images based on whether they contained Cortaderia selloana or not. Additionally, one of the models, DenseNet201, was also used in object detection mode with Faster R-CNN ResNet50, pre-trained on the MS COCO dataset. However, the main focus of the study appears to be on image classification rather than object detection or other tasks such as segmentation.
