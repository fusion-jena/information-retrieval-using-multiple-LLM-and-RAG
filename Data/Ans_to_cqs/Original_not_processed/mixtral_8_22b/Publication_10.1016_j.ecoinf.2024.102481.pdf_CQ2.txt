are  influencing  the  reproductive  process  ought  to  be  considered.  The 
incorporation  of  covariates  on  the  reproductive  process  requires 
analytical tools beyond the simple description of gonadal development. 
During  the  last  decade  the  application  of  Machine  Learning  (ML) 
techniques has grown in many research areas, serving to model complex 
relationships in ecology, genetics, and climate change (Lindegren et al., 
2020;  Rolnick  et  al.,  2022;  Schrider  and  Kern,  2018;  Smoli´nski  and 
Radtke, 2017). Machine learning algorithms use computational methods 
to  “learn”  directly  from  data  without  relying  on  a  carefully  defined 
function  as  a  model  -  in  contrast  to  a  linear  model  say,  where  the 
function must be made explicit. They are generally predictive models 
and characterised by having few assumptions and little dependency on 
the  classic  statistical  assumptions  of  conventional  models  (e.g.  error

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied in 
teleost  and  elasmobranch  reproductive  biology,  used  to  determine 
maturation  condition,  sex,  and  spawning  habitats  (Brown-Peterson 
et al., 2021; Brownscombe et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2017; Slembrouck 
et  al.,  2019;  Vitale  et  al.,  2006).  In  this  study,  Random  Forests  (RF) 
analyses  proved  to  be  similarly  effective  in  classifying  maturity  in 
Chilean hake, with high precision measured against the gold-standard of 
histological  staging.  The  RF’s  accuracy  in  classifying  immature  and 
mature-inactive females was notably high, in contrast to macroscopic 
analysis which generally misassigned these stages due to their similar 
external characteristics of the gonads – making them difficult to discern 
by  the  naked  eye,  even  for  experienced  scientific  observers.  This  is  a 
common  problem  in  macroscopic  analysis  beyond  Chilean  hake,

Knowledge of reproductive traits in exploited marine populations is crucial for their management and conser-
vation. The maturity status in fish is usually assigned by traditional methods such as macroscopy and histology. 
Macroscopic analysis is the assessing of maturity stages by naked eye and usually introduces large amount of 
error. In contrast, histology is the most accurate method for maturity staging but is expensive and unavailable for 
many  stocks  worldwide.  Here,  we  use  the  Random  Forest  (RF)  machine  learning  method  for classification  of 
reproductive  condition  in  fish,  using  the  extensive  data  from  Chilean  hake  (Merluccius  gayi  gayi).  Gonads 
randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys were classified as immature, mature-active 
and  mature-inactive.  A  classifier  for  these  three  maturity  classes  was  fitted  using  RFs,  with  the  continuous

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), to classify maturity in Chilean hake based on extensive data. Given that the focus is on reproductive condition in fish, it can be inferred that the data might include biological or physiological measurements related to the fish species. These could potentially be in various formats such as numerical values (CSV files) or images (for histological analysis). Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the exact nature of the data used in the study, it is not possible to definitively state the specific data formats employed in the deep learning pipeline.
