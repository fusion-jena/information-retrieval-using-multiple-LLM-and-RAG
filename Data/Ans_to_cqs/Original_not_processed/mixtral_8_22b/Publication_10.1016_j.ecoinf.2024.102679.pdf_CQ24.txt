with a 50% probability of occurrence. To avoid any risk of overfitting at 
each  training  stage,  we  selected  the  model  relative  to  the  epoch  that 
gave the best performance on the validation set. During inference, the 
patch  size  was  set  to  1024  × 1,024  pixels  to  accelerate  the  process.

Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  propelled  the  perspec-
tives of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 
2022),  and  announced  good  prospects  for  the  automation  of  image 
processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom 
et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL) is a subgroup of machine learning and 
artificial intelligence (AI) where artificial neural networks are trained to 
achieve challenging tasks (e.g. detect animals in aerial imagery) through 
a complex multi-level representation of information learned from a large 
amounts of data (LeCun et al., 2015). In the last decade, DL has been 
widely  employed  to  (semi-)automate  the  detection  and  counting  of

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does indicate that during the training phase, the model was selected based on its performance on the validation set rather than the training set. This approach helps prevent overfitting, which could potentially mitigate some effects of randomness introduced by factors like initial weights or random seed values. Additionally, the use of a patch size of 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference suggests that the authors may have used techniques like sliding windows or tiling to manage larger input sizes, although this doesn't directly relate to handling randomness. It would be beneficial to refer to other sources or resources for more detailed information regarding strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines.
