bobwhite  hunting  occurs  on  the  property  through  lottery-draw  quota 
hunts providing opportunities for about 200 hunters.

The northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is a gallinaceous upland 
gamebird that has been experiencing population declines throughout its 
native range over the past six decades (Brennan, 1991). Despite wide-
spread declines in population size, many populations are still harvested 
annually.  One  of  the  primary  methods  for  managing  bobwhite  pop-
ulations  is  through  setting  and  modifying  harvest  quotas  based  on 
changes in population density (Hern´andez et al., 2013). The effective-
ness  of  harvest  quotas  for  maintaining  viable  populations  while  also 
maximizing  recreational  opportunities  depends  on  the  accuracy  of 
density estimates. We designed a simulation study to evaluate bias (i.e. 
accuracy) and precision when calculating density estimates using four of 
the  most  common  methods  currently  used  in  the  field  for  bobwhite 
monitoring: 1) DS from point counts, 2) DS using ARUs, 3) SCR using

distance sampling to improve estimates of national population sizes for common and 
widespread breeding birds in the UK. J. Appl. Ecol. 45, 1330–1338.

and Shupe et al. (1987) also reported an average of 10.6 birds per covey 
from ground observations of 20 coveys. Thus, expected covey density E 
(C), for all methods averaged 0.038 coveys per ha.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or dealing with random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed by researchers and practitioners to manage randomness in such scenarios.

1. Fixed Random Seeds: To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one common strategy is to set fixed random seeds for various components like data shuffling, weight initialization, etc. This ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code runs, leading to consistent results.

2. Cross-Validation: Another approach to mitigate the impact of randomness is to use cross-validation techniques. By splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training/testing models on different subsets, we can obtain more robust performance metrics and reduce the variance caused by random initializations.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can help capture diverse patterns in the data and potentially lead to better overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking are popular ensemble methods used in machine learning pipelines.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, etc.) can significantly affect model performance. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used approaches to find optimal hyperparameters, which may indirectly address issues related to randomness in the pipeline.
