1. Introduction

Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

G = HV or VV

The initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images (see Figure 2), and they are
converted into the darknet annotation format with text ﬁles containing information on the label class
of objects and positions in the image. The Sentinel-1 images are cropped into image tiles in the sizes of
640 × 640 pixels, resulting in a total of 1609 images with corresponding label ﬁles. Code for darknet
conversion is available at GitHub (see Supplementary Materials). Out of these images, 20% (322) are
selected as validation data, and the remaining 80% (1288) for model training.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this information alone whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other cloud service provider.
