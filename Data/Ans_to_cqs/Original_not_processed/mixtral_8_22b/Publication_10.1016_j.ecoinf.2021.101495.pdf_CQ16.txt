Fig. 1. Diagram of our methodology. There are four main modules: Preprocessing of historical images (purple, sec. 2.1), model training and validation (red, sec. 2.2 
and sec. 2.3), prediction making (green, sec. 3.1 and sec. 3.3) and ground truth validation (orange, sec. 2.5 and sec. 3.4). The original image database (dark purple) 
and the training set (dark red, sec. 3.2) are also highlighted. Data used in each module is specified in Table 1. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred from common machine learning practices that some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. In this case, since the table shows the total number of segments for each label used during the classification by species, it might suggest that the training was stopped after a fixed number of iterations or epochs. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
