following results:  

3.2. LigObNet detection performance 

1)  The integration of the parameter-free attention mechanism SimAM 
yielded improved detection accuracy while maintaining the detec-
tion speed and model complexity on par with those of the E3 model, 
demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing the overall performance of 
fish detection in our proposed model.  

2)  The computational load remains constant when integrating the SE, 
CBAM, and CA attention mechanisms; however, the model endowed 
with SE attention achieves higher speeds owing to a reduced number 
of network layers.  

3)  Employing attention mechanisms may decrease the detection speed 
by  1.2–12.3%  relative  to  the  baseline  E3  model,  which  does  not 
incorporate such mechanisms. Nevertheless, this study contends that 
the integration of attention mechanisms is advantageous because it 
allows  the  extraction  of  more  detailed  information  on  targets, 
thereby enhancing detection accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be mentioned. Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources like weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, or even hardware-related factors. To manage these aspects, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value across different stages of the pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in experiments. Another approach involves conducting multiple runs with different seeds and averaging the results to mitigate the impact of randomness. Additionally, techniques like deterministic algorithms or parallel computing methods can also help reduce variability caused by randomness. Nonetheless, without specific details about the deep learning pipeline in question, it is challenging to provide a precise solution.
