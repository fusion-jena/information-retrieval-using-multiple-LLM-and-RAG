sun glint, this study reduces the number of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels 
in the convolutional block from 64 to 32, a measure taken to mitigate 
overfitting.  Additionally,  a  residual  structure  is  incorporated  into  the 
ResConv block based on the ResNet network (He et al., 2016). This in-
volves a series of operations: 3 × 3 convolution, batch normalization 
(BN),  rectified  linear  unit  (RELU)  activation  function,  followed  by 
another  3  × 3  convolution,  BN,  and  element-wise  addition  with  the 
output  of  the  initial  3  × 3  convolution.  Subsequently,  the  resulting 
feature map undergoes a secondary RELU activation function to obtain 
the convolutional feature results. Fig. 3(c) shows the Upsample block, 
responsible for restoring the feature map’s size to twice its original di-
mensions, comprising consecutive upsample, 3 × 3 convolution, BN, and 
RELU activation function operations.

residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed

water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

In the evolution of convolutional neural networks, residual modules 
and attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) have played pivotal 
roles. Residual modules mitigate overfitting issues in the network, while 
attention mechanisms enable the network to prioritize important fea-

2.5. Parameter setting 

The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. 
The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory, along with 
an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the 
network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, 
flips,  and  other  image  augmentation  operations  to  enhance  the  net-
work’s robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size 
set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate 
was  adjusted  using  the  equal-interval  adjustment  strategy  (StepLR), 
halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

Helpful Answer:
To prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, several regularization methods can be employed. In the given context, two such techniques are mentioned: reducing the number of convolutional kernels and incorporating residual structures.

Firstly, the study reduces the number of 3x3 convolutional kernels in the convolutional block from 64 to 32. This reduction helps decrease the model complexity, making it more generalized and less prone to overfitting. By having fewer parameters to learn, the model becomes less likely to memorize the training data and instead focuses on capturing the underlying patterns.

Secondly, the study integrates residual structures into the ResConv block based on the ResNet network. Residual structures help mitigate overfitting by enabling the creation of deeper networks without increasing computational cost or risking vanishing gradients. They do so by introducing shortcut connections between layers, allowing the gradient to flow directly through these connections during backpropagation. As a result, the network can maintain high accuracy even when adding more layers, thus preventing overfitting.

While not explicitly mentioned in the context, other common regularization methods include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations among neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust features. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. This discourages large weight values and promotes simpler models, ultimately helping reduce overfitting.
