91.2%; however, the biggest problem with the combined method was its 
operational efficiency, which could not be applied to all scenarios. Coro 
and Walsh (2021) proposed an underwater detector for moving object 
sizes  to  monitor  the  size  of  key  indicator  species  in  marine  fish.  The 
visibility  of  marine  scenes  is  high  and  good  features  can  typically  be 
extracted. The semi-and weakly supervised deep neural networks pro-
posed by Jahanbakht et al. (2023) can also detect fish in turbid waters 
with an accuracy of up to 94%.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a targeted fish species dataset, suggesting that this dataset might have been collected using various methods such as surveys or sensors. Additionally, there are references to studies that use underwater devices for fish size monitoring (Coro & Walsh, 2021) and high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers (Palmer, 2022). These studies imply the usage of specialized equipment like cameras or sensors for gathering data. Furthermore, the study by Durve et al. (2022) discusses automatic droplet tracking with YOLOv5 and DeepSORT for microfluidic applications, indicating the potential use of advanced imaging techniques for data collection. Lastly, the reference to a paper discussing fish detection based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images (Qin et al., 2022) suggests the utilization of image processing techniques for acquiring relevant data.
