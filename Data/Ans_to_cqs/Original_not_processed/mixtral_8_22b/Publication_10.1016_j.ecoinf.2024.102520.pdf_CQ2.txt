2.3. Image acquisition and processing

The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

the soil substrates for selecting sustainable growing mediums in terms of thermal

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery. Specifically, the study utilizes Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands of 30-meter resolution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). These datasets are processed through geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking techniques before being fed into the deep learning model. Additionally, topographic variables such as slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material are derived from DEM using SAGA GIS. Therefore, it appears that the main data formats utilized in this study are raster-based geospatial data, including both multispectral satellite imagery and digital elevation models.
