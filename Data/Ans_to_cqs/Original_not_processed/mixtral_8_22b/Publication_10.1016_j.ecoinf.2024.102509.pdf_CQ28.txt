HV were extracted from 
the processed multispectral and SAR datasets with respect to the cor-
responding field sampling grids. The AGBe, NDVI, σ0
HV values of 
these plots were further partitioned into 70:30 ratios for simulating and 
validating  the  AGB  prediction  model  respectively  using  the  R  4.1.2 
statistical software package (Deb et al., 2017; R Core Team, 2019). From 
similar  studies  conducted  previously,  a  few  parametric  (linear  and 
nonlinear)  regression  models  mostly  used  for  AGB  prediction  were 
identified, viz. linear, power and exponential (Aslan et al., 2016; Nesha 
et  al.,  2020).  In  these  models,  the  in-situ  AGBest  had  been  used  as  a 
response variable (yj, j = 1), whereas image-derived spectral reflectance 
as well as backscatter data (e.g. NDVI, σ0
HV) were considered as 
predictor variables (xi; i = 1, 2, ….., n). Among non-parametric models, 
the artificial neural network (ANN) method has also been applied in this
