keyword  search,  literature  screening,  and  data  compilation.  In  this 
database, SOCS data are organized considering depths from 0 to 20 cm 
and 0–100 cm. In this study, a set of 2207 SOCS at depths from 0 to 20 
cm from 2010 to 2014 was retrieved from the database.

2.3.2. Model development 

We  modeled  the  relationship  between  SOCS  and  environmental 

covariates using a general predictive function: 

SOCSi = f (R, PM, S, Ci, Bi)

(4)  

where R is the topography, PM is the parent material, S is the soil var-
iable, C is the climate, and B denotes the biota variable. 

We used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer percep-
tron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. This algorithm is a type of feedforward 
artificial  neural  network  (Bishop,  1995)  comprising  an  input  layer, 
multiple hidden  layers, and  an output  layer. The  input layer  receives 
features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the 
hidden layer hides the extracted features, while the output layer yields 
the  prediction  results  (SOCS).  Except  for  the  input  layer,  each  layer 
consists  of  a  set  of  individual  nodes  (neurons).  Each  node  connects 
adjacent layers via the activation function. The MLP technique develops

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the study uses a set of 2207 SOCS (soil organic carbon stocks) data points collected from 2010 to 2014. Using a larger dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize better to unseen data. Additionally, the study models the relationship between SOCS and various environmental factors like topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biotic variables. Including multiple relevant factors in the model could also contribute to improving its generalizability.
