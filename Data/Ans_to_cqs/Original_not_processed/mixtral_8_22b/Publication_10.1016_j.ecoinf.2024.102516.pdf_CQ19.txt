In this phase the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute 
error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution 
(cid:0) 5. Moreover, we utilize 
of 1536 × 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10
only horizontal flipping for data augmentation in this phase. 

2.5. Baseline comparison 

To also have a comparison of our method with a simpler approach, 
we compare our results with the ones from a ResNet50 that was pre- 
trained  on  the  ImageNet  classification  dataset  (Russakovsky  et  al., 
2015) with added FPN, later also referred to at ImageNet baseline model. 
As the ImageNet dataset is a normal classification dataset that does not 
contain the plant species from our dataset, this network cannot be uti-
lized  for  zero-shot  cover  prediction.  Hence,  we  only  evaluate  this 
network after training it on our dedicated plant cover data.

2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, it mentions that the ResNet50 is initialized with ImageNet weights from Keras. This suggests that the authors might have used Keras, a high-level neural networks API written in Python, running on top of TensorFlow or Theano, to develop their deep learning models.
