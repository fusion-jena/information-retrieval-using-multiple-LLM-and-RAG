Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, various techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both subsets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to uneven representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers another. It involves duplicating samples from the minority class until it reaches a more balanced ratio with the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic examples can also be generated using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to achieve balance between classes. However, this may lead to loss of valuable information if important patterns exist within the discarded samples.

Lastly, collecting diverse data helps mitigate bias introduced by limited sources or demographics represented in the dataset. By incorporating varied perspectives and characteristics, models trained on such data will likely generalize better across different populations and scenarios.

These techniques aim to improve fairness and accuracy in deep learning models by reducing potential biases stemming from unrepresentative or skewed datasets.
