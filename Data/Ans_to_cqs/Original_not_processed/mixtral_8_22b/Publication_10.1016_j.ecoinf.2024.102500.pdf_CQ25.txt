maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

hyperparameter  automatically.  However,  given  their  capability  to 
assemble 40 models in one simulation, we are leveraging this advantage 
to narrow down the selection of machine learning models. Subsequently, 
based on the suggestions of the Lazy Predict algorithm, ML models were 
further fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques. This process 
led to the development of robust ML models for each SWQP one after 
another. These ML models were optimized for each water quality mea-
sure. XGB, RF, and ET were chosen to build a stacking-based ANN meta 
ML  model  based  on  their  best  performance  and  the  entire  autoML 
model’s results.

3.2.2.8. LGBM  hyperparameter  tweaking. Table  2  shows  the  LGBM 
model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as whether it is intended for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to accurately predict and analyze water quality measures, specifically nitrate and dissolved oxygen levels. The authors employ various machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosting (LGBM), random forest (RF), and extreme tree (ET), which are then combined to create a stacking-based artificial neural network (ANN) meta-machine learning model. The main objective of this approach is to improve the overall accuracy and predictive capabilities of the models, making them suitable for use in academic research and publications related to water quality management.
