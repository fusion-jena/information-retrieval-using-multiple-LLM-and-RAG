This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

4.2. Experimental setup 

During the training phase, to accommodate multivariate input and 
univariate output, the input and output dimensions of the encoder and 
decoder  are set  to the  number of variables  in the  dataset. The model 
dimensionality  is  set  to  128  to  achieve  a  balance  between  model 
complexity  and  computational  efficiency.  Additionally,  the  model  in-
tegrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel in-
formation flows. The model architecture includes two layers of encoders 
and one layer of decoders, which help to comprehensively capture fea-
tures from time series data. To reduce the risk of overfitting, a dropout

The model initially decomposes the target variable to be predicted 
from multivariate marine chemical data into trends and several seasonal 
components  to  capture  key  representative  information.  This  informa-
tion,  along  with  different  covariates,  is  fed  into  the  model.  After  un-
dergoing  embedding  and  feature  selection,  the  encoder  captures  the 
feature  associations  among  multiple  variables  through  a  two-stage 
attention  mechanism.  Upon  completing  the  processing  step  via  the 
encoder, Q and V are outputted. In the prediction phase, the covariates 
and the target predictive variable are masked, re-encoded and selected 
as features; this is followed by a dual-stage attention computation in the 
decoder with the Q and V of the encoder. Finally, through a linear layer 
and a normalization operation, the model generates the predicted future 
outputs.  This  model  comprises  three  interconnected  core  stages.  The
