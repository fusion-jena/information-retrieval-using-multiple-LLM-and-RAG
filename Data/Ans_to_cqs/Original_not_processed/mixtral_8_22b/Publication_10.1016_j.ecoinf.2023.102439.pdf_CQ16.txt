The model’s training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, 
encompassing 264 data points. Subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, 
comprising  72  data  points,  were  reserved  for  testing  and  validation 
purposes.  This  data  partitioning  resulted  in  a  distribution  of  60%  for 
training and 40% for validation and testing. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, several statistical metrics 
were  employed,  including  the  Mean  Absolute  Percent  Error  (MAPE), 
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and cor-
relation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy 
and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation be-
tween the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

Table 5 presents the performance of the W-ANN model based on the 
number of selected hidden layer neurons. The most favourable outcomes 
were attained by utilising 6 hidden layer neurons for Iznik and 9 hidden 
layer neurons for Alanya.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some possible methods based on common practices in machine learning.

One commonly used criterion is the validation loss plateau. Training continues until the validation error stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model might be overfitting the training data. Another method could involve setting a predefined maximum number of epochs or iterations, after which training would stop regardless of the model's performance.

In this case, the text mentions that the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by incrementally adjusting their count to find the configuration yielding the best results. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set during training might have been monitored to decide when to stop adding more neurons.

Additionally, the use of various statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R) indicates that these measures likely played a role in evaluating the model's performance during training and determining its completion.
