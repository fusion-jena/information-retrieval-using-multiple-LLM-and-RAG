2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

to 212 in the 13th dilated convolutional layer. However, this was not used 
for the 14th  or final dilated convolutional layers. Batch normalization 
was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by 
Chen  et  al.  (2017),  whereas  a  non-linear  operation  was  implemented 
using a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU). The framework of the deep 
feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network is shown in Fig. 4.

traditional noise reduction methods that generally tend to be suitable for 
eliminating  smooth  noise.  However,  field  recordings  often  consist  of 
significant  amounts  of  non-smooth  noise,  rendering  traditional  bio-
acoustic  noise  reduction  methods  at  least  partially  ineffective  for 
adaptive noise reduction in field recordings. In this context, relatively 
few  studies  to  date  have  sought  to  assess  the  potential  value  of  deep 
learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. Moreover, the current scarcity 
of  labeled  clean  bioacoustic  recordings  makes  it  challenging  to  train 
deep  learning-based  models  for  bioacoustic  noise  reduction.  Further-
more,  the  application  of  deep  learning  bioacoustic  noise  reduction 
methods for different types of noises and different frequency bands of 
bird species calls has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Given that birds 
are  considered  good  indicators  of  ecological  health  and  that  their

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, some general preprocessing techniques can be assumed based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning. These may include data cleaning, such as handling missing values or outliers, and data transformation, like normalization or scaling. Normalization typically involves rescaling features so they fall within a certain range, while scaling adjusts the magnitude of features without changing their distribution. Additionally, the text mentions batch normalization being performed using an adaptive normalization operator, which suggests that input data might have been normalized during the training process. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed if these specific preprocessing steps were applied in this case.
