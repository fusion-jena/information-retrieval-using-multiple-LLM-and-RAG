hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the

The regression hyperparameter tuning has been performed for all the 
nine prediction models (XGB, RF, SVR, GP, EN, KNN, MLP, Tree and LR), 
and  based  on  that,  the  best  regression  parameter  has  been  used  for 
training the model. 

As illustrated in Fig. 8, the x-axis denotes the sequence of observed 
values, and the y-axis represents the differences between the predicted 
and  observed values. As  can be seen, there  is a  constant trend  in the 
distribution of differences between predicted and observed values as the 
observed values increase on the X-axis. Particularly, the values on the Y- 
axis remain consistently close to 0, both above and below the reference 
line,  indicating  relative  stability  in  the  discrepancies  between  pre-
dictions and actual values across the range of observed values.

Table 4 includes details such as the name of the prediction model, its 
hyperparameters,  the  parameters  selected  during  the  5-fold  cross- 
validation,  and  the  hyperparameters  adjusted  according  to  the  selec-
tion  criteria  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  configuration  for  the 
prediction model.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that several machine learning models were utilized, including XGB, RF, SVR, GP, EN, KNN, MLP, Tree, and LR. However, only one of these models, MLP, is typically associated with deep learning. The table mentioned in the text likely contains the specific hyperparameters used for each model, but since it isn't included here, I cannot provide exact hyperparameters for the MLP or any other model.

That being said, some general hyperparameters often used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and activation function. In the list of potential hyperparameters provided, 'learning\_rate','max\_iter', and 'activation' could potentially apply to the MLP model. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to definitively state which hyperparameters were used for the MLP model.
