coverage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the prediction results.

The concept of SOWCEM focused on mitigating the biases of indi-
vidual prediction methods by effectively combining multiple predictive
models or synthesizing multiple factors. This achieves optimal spatio-
temporal adaptive weighted combination prediction, generating
Sentinel-2 NDVI regular dense-time-series data with a high spatiotem-
poral resolution. This enhances the reliability, stability, and accuracy of
the algorithm. A crucial aspect of composite prediction is determining
the weights of each individual prediction method. When n different
prediction models are employed for remote sensing image prediction
and reconstruction, the composite prediction model formed by these n
individual models is as follows:

zt,(x,y) =

∑n

i=1

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it can be generally assumed that common practices in machine learning and deep learning have been followed. These typically involve splitting the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common ratios for this split include 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10% for the training, validation, and testing sets respectively.

In summary, without further details regarding the specific criteria used in this case, we can assume that standard practices for splitting datasets in machine learning and deep learning applications have likely been applied.
