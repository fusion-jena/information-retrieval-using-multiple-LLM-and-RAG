predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANNs), in modeling and predictive analysis. It also mentions the importance of high-quality and large datasets for accurate training of these networks.

To address the query directly, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within images to identify their location and size. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique goes beyond bounding boxes and provides pixel-level classification of each object in an image. It is useful when precise object boundaries are required.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation classifies every pixel into a category without differentiating instances of the same category.

4. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves identifying key points on objects within images. It is often used in facial recognition systems.

5. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding boxes, polygonal shapes are drawn around objects but offer more precision by allowing irregular shapes.
