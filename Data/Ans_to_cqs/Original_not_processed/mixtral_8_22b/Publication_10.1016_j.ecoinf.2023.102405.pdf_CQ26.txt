3.2. Data pre-processing 

Data  pre-processing,  a  crucial  step  in  ensuring  the  reliability  and 
integrity of data, involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to enhance 
its  quality  and  completeness.  In  this  study,  we  employed  various 
methods to pre-process the data, making it suitable for analysis. A sig-
nificant aspect of our pre-processing involved data cleansing, where we 
diligently identified and removed any incomplete or inaccurate records 
to ensure the dataset's accuracy.

Water contamination presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting the sustainability of ecosystems 
and  the  health  of  aquatic  organisms.  Precisely  assessing  water  contamination  levels  is  crucial  for  effective 
monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating 
water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. 
Integrating  computer  technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  and  Data 
Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have 
limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study 
proposes  a  comprehensive  framework  that  incorporates  IoT-based  data  collection  and  data  segregation  tech-

Addressing the pressing issue of water contamination in aquaculture, 
this research has presented a comprehensive framework that effectively 
classifies water quality to ensure ecosystem sustainability and the health 
of  aquatic  organisms.  Existing  deep  learning  approaches  often  face 
challenges  related  to  data  heterogeneity,  interpretability,  and  perfor-
mance.  In  response,  our  study  proposes  a  powerful  solution  that  in-
tegrates IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation, resulting in 
precise water contamination classification. By leveraging real-time data 
from  IoT  devices,  including  temperature,  pH,  dissolved  oxygen,  and 
nitrate concentration, we enable a holistic assessment of water quality. 
Employing  fish-specific  acceptable  ranges,  we  calculate  a  water 
contamination index, facilitating the accurate segregation of data into 
contaminated and non-contaminated classes. This critical step ensures

One  of  the  techniques  employed  in  data  imputation  was  mean 
imputation  shown in  (1)  (Maharana  et  al.,  2022), aimed  at  replacing 
missing  data  with  the  average  of  the  remaining  values.  This  imputed 
value was calculated by adding the missing value to the sum of observed 
values  and  dividing  it  by  the  total  number  of  observed  values,  as 
depicted  in  the  equation.  By  leveraging  such  data  pre-processing 
methods, we could confidently proceed with our analysis, relying on a 
well-structured and dependable dataset.

where Xi  is the imputed value, Xm  is the missing value, X0  is the set of

Capping is a method to limit dataset values using a fixed threshold 
represented  in  (2)  (Maharana  et  al.,  2022).  It  ensures  values  remain 
within allowed parameters, optimizing them with respect to upper and 
lower bounds.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions several general data preprocessing methods employed in this study. These include data cleansing, which involves identifying and removing incomplete or inaccurate records to improve dataset accuracy. Additionally, the text discusses data imputation techniques like mean imputation, which replaces missing data with the average of the remaining values. Another mentioned technique is capping, which limits dataset values using a fixed threshold to keep them within allowed parameters. While these methods contribute to enhancing data quality and integrity, they do not directly address data bias issues typically encountered in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined if any specific techniques were utilized to tackle data bias during preprocessing.
