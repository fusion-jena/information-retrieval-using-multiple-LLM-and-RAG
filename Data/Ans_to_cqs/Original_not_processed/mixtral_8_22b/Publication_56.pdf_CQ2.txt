Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

RS classification approaches mainly exploit information derived from the spatial and spectral domains of a 
single image, and also the temporal information in the case of using image time series. DL classification algo-
rithms that use RS data can be roughly differentiated in two major groups: techniques that design convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) architectures for spatial learning, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential 
learning. For a comprehensive overview, we refer the reader to excellent reviews of DL techniques and applica-
tions in RS provided by Zhang et al.19, Zhu et al.20, and Ma et al.21. CNNs are composed of multiple layers that 
are the result of performing spatial convolutions typically followed by activation units and pooling. RNNs are 
able to deal with sequences of data (e.g., RS time series), in such a way that the output from the previous time

The use of deep learning (DL) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing (RS) data is rapidly 
increasing. DL techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter 
estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report 
precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This 
shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of DL approaches by a wider users community, as model’s 
decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or 
policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen 
the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel‑2 time 
series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This permits to address

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary focus is on the application of deep learning techniques to analyze remote sensing (RS) data. While specific details regarding the exact format of this data are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the data primarily consists of images due to the nature of remote sensing. Remote sensing involves capturing images of the earth's surface from various platforms like satellites, aircraft, etc. These images may include multispectral or hyperspectral data, which provide detailed information about the physical characteristics of the observed objects.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing this data. CNNs are particularly effective in handling image data, while RNNs are often used for sequential data, including time series data. Given these points, it can be concluded that the data used in this deep learning pipeline is predominantly in the form of images, potentially accompanied by other related metadata. However, without more explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated whether additional data formats like audio, video, or CSV files are included in the pipeline.
