2.2. CNN Classiﬁcation System

In order to carry out the design of the CNN classiﬁcation system, a set of stages
were followed. These stages are represented in Figure 9 and described in the following
subsections.

Figure 9. Stages in the classiﬁcation system.

Each of the stages was programmed with Python using the Keras library [30] for CNNs.

2.2.1. Data Augmentation

In order to generate a more robust training set, an augmentation process was carried
out using the sound database. When one deals with CNN and images, data augmenta-
tion consists of extending the set of images from their transformations (rotations, size
modiﬁcations, etc.). For the purpose of the present work on sounds, the transformations
must be made on the audios, and later these transformations will be reﬂected in the
mel-spectrogram images.

In this way, for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios

were generated:

ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).
Figure 11 shows the structure of the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify different types of anuran calls. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly employed for image recognition tasks. In this case, they are applied to mel-spectrogram images derived from audio signals. The goal is to create a robust training set by applying various transformations to the original audio samples, such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding noise. This process, known as data augmentation, helps improve the performance and generalizability of the model. The CNN architecture includes three convolution layers with increasing numbers of output filters (32, 64, and 128 respectively), all using a kernel size of 3x3. Following the convolution layers, there is a fully connected layer with 512 neurons and a softmax layer for multi-class classification. The model is trained using 80% of the available samples and tested on the remaining 20%, ensuring a balanced distribution of classes within both sets.
