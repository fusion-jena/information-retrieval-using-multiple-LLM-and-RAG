hyperparameters.  The  hyperparameters  with  the  current  results  are 
saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the 
proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. 
After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides 
us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN. 
The  overall  complexity  is  dominated  by  the  iterations,  “TC”,  and 
within  each  iteration,  the  operations  depend  on  the  population  size 
“NP”.  Therefore,  the  total  complexity  can  be  approximated  as 
O(TC*NP).

capability  of  the  algorithm.  As  shown  in  the  algorithm  mentioned  in 
section  2.2,  the  search  begins  independently  by  all  the  populations 
simultaneously. Local minima can be avoided by interacting the local 
best individual solutions with the global best solutions. This is done as 
the algorithm proceeds further.

help of mathematical functions. The search process is categorized into 
two phases. The first phase is known as global search or exploration, in 
which  the  algorithm  tries  to  explore  different  regions  within  a  given 
search range. This movement is random to ensure that the entire search 
space is covered thoroughly. The second phase is known as local search 
or exploitation, where the goal is to find promising solutions or a set of 
solutions from the area discovered during the first phase. Achieving a 
balance between these two phases is crucial in designing optimization

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model are optimized using a search space exploration method. However, the specific optimization technique used is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

From Table 4, we can see that there are several hyperparameters listed for the CNN model, including the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and the type of CNN model optimizer. Each of these hyperparameters has a specified range of values to be explored.

It is also mentioned that the proposed approach saves the hyperparameters with the current results until better accuracy is achieved. Additionally, the termination criterion of the proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. After completing the iterations, the proposed approach provides us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN.

While the exact optimization technique used is not clear from the provided context, based on the information available, it seems possible that either a grid search or random search could have been employed to optimize the hyperparameters. Grid search involves systematically exploring every combination of hyperparameter values within a predefined range, while random search randomly samples combinations of hyperparameter values within a defined range. Both techniques aim to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters that result in the highest performance of the model.

Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be definitively determined which optimization technique was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN model.
