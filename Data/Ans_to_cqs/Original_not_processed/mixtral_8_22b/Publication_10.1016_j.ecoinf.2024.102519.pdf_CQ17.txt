The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. Dropout effectively approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimizer tries to minimize not only the original loss but also the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by reducing their complexity and preventing them from memorizing the training data.
