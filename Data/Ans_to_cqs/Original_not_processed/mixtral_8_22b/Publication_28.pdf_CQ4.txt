A  detailed  comparative  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE 
manner  takes  place  with  other  techniques  on  the  AIM  dataset  in 
Table 4 and Fig. 9 (Li et al., 2020). From the outcomes, it can be obvious 
that  the  CNN-RBFNN,  CA-CNNâ€“BiLSTM,  and  CNN  manners have  out-
performed  least  performance  over  the  other  techniques.  In  line  with, 
MLRSSC-CGNN-SGAT,  MLRSSC-CGNN-MLGAT,  and  AL-RCNN  algo-
rithms have accomplished reasonably closer results. Besides, the DLEN- 
LSTM,  DLEN-DNN,  and  DLEN-VAE  approaches  have  resulted  in 
competitive  outcomes  with  respect  to  various  measures.  But,  the

During  the  classification  process,  the  VAE  model  gets  executed  to 
assign proper class labels to the applied satellite images. Autoencoder 
(AE) is a kind of NN which is trained to replace the input with the output. 
It includes a hidden layer h to define a code employed for input repre-
sentation. The network comprises of an encoder function z = f(x) and 
decoder function r = g(z), where x denotes the input data. The mean-
ingful features from the AE by the constraint that the z to have lower 
dimensions compared to x. The code of the AE which is lesser than the 
input  dimensions  are  known  as  under  complete.  The  learning  of  the 
undercomplete  depiction  enforces  the  AE  in  capturing  the  important 
characteristics of the training data. The VAE is a directed network which 
makes  use  of  learned  approximate  inferences  and  undergoes  training 
using gradient approaches. For generating a sample from the model, the

cientNet utilizes inverted bottleneck convolutional that is initial estab-
lished in the MobileNetV2 method that has a layer which initial expands 
the  networks  and  next  compresses  the  channel.  This  framework 
decreased calculation by the factor of 2 as related to normal convolu-
tional, in which f implies the filter size. The researchers in Hassan et al. 
(2021) outperformed that EfficientNetB0 is the easiest of every 8 tech-
niques  and  utilizes  less  parameters.  Therefore,  it  is  directly  utilized 
EfficientNetB0  for  evaluating  efficiency.  Fig.  3  illustrates  the  layered 
architecture of EfficientNet.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization ability of the model. It would require additional context or information to determine if any of these techniques were specifically used in this case.
