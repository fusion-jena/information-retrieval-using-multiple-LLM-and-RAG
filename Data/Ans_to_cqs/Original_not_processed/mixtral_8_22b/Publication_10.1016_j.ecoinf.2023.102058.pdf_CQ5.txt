Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

Thirty-two  water  samples  were  collected  for  laboratory  analyses 
during  the  aerial  imaging  campaign  on  July  11,  2010.  Samples  were 
collected  from  thirty  reservoirs  with  different  trophic  levels  (i.e.,  hy-
pertrophic ponds and sandpit lakes with oligotrophic-mesotrophic water 
types),  with  a  total  water  surface  area  of  1904.6  ha.  The  smallest 
reservoir  (Z´ajezek  fishpond) was 4.23 ha and the  largest (Staˇnkovský 
fishpond) 197.0 ha. The average area of the reservoirs of interest was 
63.5 ha. Each sampling point location was recorded using GPS.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the type of data used. For instance, the study mentions the use of hyperspectral imagery and satellite imagery for water quality assessment. Additionally, the study refers to the collection of thirty-two water samples during an aerial imaging campaign, which suggests that the researchers may have used their own custom dataset for training and testing the machine learning models. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined if standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in this particular study.
