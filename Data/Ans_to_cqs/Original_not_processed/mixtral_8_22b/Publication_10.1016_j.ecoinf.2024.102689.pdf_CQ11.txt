As deep learning continues to flourish, a myriad of researchers has 
pivoted  their  focus  towards  animal  individual  recognition,  aiming  to 
gain  deeper  insights  into  animal  behavior,  growth  status,  and  more. 
However,  the  pursuit  of  animal  individual  recognition  necessitates  a 
substantial  dataset  of  animal  images,  and  acquiring  such  datasets  is 
often challenging. To overcome the hurdle of dataset collection, Ferreira 
et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously gathers training 
data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for their study on small bird individual recognition. This 
approach  alleviates  the  need  for  manual  annotation  and  independent 
neural network training.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to any data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, some related research papers have been cited which might contain relevant details about the deep learning pipelines used for animal individual recognition. For instance, Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously collects training data, generates training datasets, and trains convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for small bird individual recognition. Unfortunately, without additional context or access to these publications, we cannot determine if they include links to the respective data repositories containing the deep learning pipelines.
