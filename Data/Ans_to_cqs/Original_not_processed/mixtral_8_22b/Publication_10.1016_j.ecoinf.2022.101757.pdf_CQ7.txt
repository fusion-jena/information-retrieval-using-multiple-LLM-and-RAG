Martinez-Sanchez et al.

To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or time series split depending on the nature of the data. It is also important to ensure that the distribution of samples across different classes remains consistent between the splits.

Based on the given context, it can only be assumed that the authors followed standard practices for splitting their dataset. Without further information, it cannot be determined if any specific criteria were used for splitting the data.
