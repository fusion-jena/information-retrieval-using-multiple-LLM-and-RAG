%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by Zhang et al. (2023). Therefore, it is not possible to determine which datasets were used in their study. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets consist of images and corresponding labels, which can be used to train and test various deep learning models.
