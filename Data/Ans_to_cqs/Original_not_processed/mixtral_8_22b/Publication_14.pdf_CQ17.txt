classes. Dropout is a form of regularisation that randomly removes 

a  proportion  of  nodes  to  reduce  overfitting  (Srivastava,  Hinton, 

Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Salakhutdinov, 2014). The fully connected 

layer reduces the vector of image features to the desired dimension-

ality of length two (foreground and background). The softmax layer 

normalises  this  vector  into  probabilities  that  sum  to  one  across  all 

classes.  DeepMeerkat  is  designed  to  be  conservative,  with  a  high 

threshold for retaining frames (acceptance value = 0.1). This means 

that the model must be more than 90% confident that a frame does 

not contain a foreground object to assign a background label. This 

prioritises minimising false negatives at the potential expense of in-

Helpful Answer:
Answer: One of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is dropout. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single input feature. In the paper by Srivastava et al. (2014), dropout is described as a method that randomly removes a proportion of nodes to reduce overfitting. Other common regularization techniques include L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. However, the use of L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
