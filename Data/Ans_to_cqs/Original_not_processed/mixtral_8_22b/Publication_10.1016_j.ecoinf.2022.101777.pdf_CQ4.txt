tion, the 20 m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10 m in order to 
harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was 
adjusted to this resolution.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

increase  the  water  holding  capacity  of  soils  and  the  reconnection  of 
floodplains or ponds to rivers (Collentine and Futter, 2018).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to existing data. However, without more information about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it cannot be determined which, if any, data augmentation techniques have been applied.
