The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

propagation. Then, the specific hierarchical features Fh,k(⋅) are obtained 
and  transmitted  to  the  classification  module.  This  module  consists  of 
parallel  K  fully-connected  layers  followed  by  a  softmax  activation 
̂
S = {̂s1, ̂s2, ⋯, ̂sK},  repre-
function,  which  generates  predicted  scores 
senting the probability of each class within the K classification levels. 
Finally, a path correction scheme is utilized to generate the predictive 
labels ̂y. Our primary objective is to learn the model parameters, namely 
θ = {θa, θb, θc}, through end-to-end training to enable the model for bird 
sound identification. More specific technical details are elaborated on in 
the subsequent sections.

We denote the mean of training the hierarchical framework proposed 
by Wang et al., 2021 using our attention-based Xception backbone as 
“LHT+”,  where  LHT  stands  for  label  hierarchy  transformation.  This 
framework  uses  specific  classification  headings  at  different  levels  to 
distinguish features of varying levels. Finer-level features contribute to 
predicting coarser-level labels through a label hierarchy transformation 
matrix. Our path correction strategy was also incorporated. To ensure a 
fair  comparison,  we  avoided  data  augmentation  in  all  models  and 
maintained consistent hyper-parameters and random seed settings.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that some form of preprocessing would have been performed due to its importance in preparing raw data for effective machine learning tasks. Common preprocessing techniques include normalization or standardization, scaling, noise removal, missing value imputation, encoding categorical variables, etc. These methods help improve the quality of input data, reduce computational complexity, and enhance the overall performance of the model.
