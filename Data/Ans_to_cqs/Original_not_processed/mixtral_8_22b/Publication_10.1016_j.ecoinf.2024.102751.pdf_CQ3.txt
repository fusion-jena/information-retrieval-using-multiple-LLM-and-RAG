Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

imagery collected on 2020-08-22 was used.

2.4. Satellite data

2.5. Developing predictive model

PlanetScope is a large constellation of nanosatellites capable of im-
aging the globe daily, offering more opportunities for cloud-free images.
The first groups of PlanetScope satellites were launched in 2015, and the
constellation currently consists of >180 satellites placed in helio-
synchronous orbits. The satellites have digital cameras that offer four
spectral bands: red, green, blue, and infrared, with a spatial resolution of
3.7 m at the nadir, where the nadir is defined as the point on the Earth’s
surface directly below the satellite. For end users, imagery is re-sampled

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided references and text snippets. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, line annotation, and keypoint annotation. These techniques help train models to recognize objects, classify pixels, identify instances, draw shapes around objects, label lines, and locate important points respectively.
