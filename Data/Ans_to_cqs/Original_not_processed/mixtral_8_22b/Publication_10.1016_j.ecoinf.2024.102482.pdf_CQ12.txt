2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

This paper proposes a water quality monitoring system based on a 
deep learning model, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), with the aim of improving 
the  performance  of  existing  monitoring  systems  using  the  swimming 
behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator. The LSTM model is 
a representative deep learning model used for learning and predicting 
time-series  data,  such  as  streamflow  forecasting  or  water  pollution 
detection in the field of ecological informatics (Dehghani et al., 2023; 
Guo et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). In contrast to previous studies that 
focused on only one specific pollutant, this research used formaldehyde 
and  benzene,  representative  environmental  pollutants,  each  at  a  con-
centration of 0.1 mg/L. The system's input utilized features representing 
the swimming behavior of nematodes recorded by a CCD camera and 
expressed as Branch Length Similarity (BLS) entropy.

challenging.  This  difficulty  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  bio-
monitoring systems, unlike water quality analysis studies, require sig-
nificant  time  and  effort  to  collect  data  for  training.  As  a  result,  the 
integration  of  deep  learning  into  biomonitoring  for  water  quality 
pollution detection is an area that has yet to see widespread exploration. 
Nevertheless, despite these challenges, recent developments in various 
fields  of  ecology  have  demonstrated  high  performance  in  time-series 
data  analysis  using  the  LSTM  model,  a  type  of  DRNN  model  (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Dehghani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; O'Donncha 
et  al.,  2022;  Zhang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  study,  we  showed  that  the 
performance of a biomonitoring system using time-series data, such as 
the swimming behavior of C. elegans, can be significantly improved by 
introducing  the  LSTM  model.  It  showed  a  high  detection  accuracy  of

Helpful Answer:
The proposed water quality monitoring system uses a deep learning model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The LSTM model is known for its ability to learn and predict time-series data, making it suitable for applications like streamflow forecasting or water pollution detection in ecological informatics. In this case, the LSTM model is used to improve the performance of existing monitoring systems using the swimming behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator for water quality pollution detection.
