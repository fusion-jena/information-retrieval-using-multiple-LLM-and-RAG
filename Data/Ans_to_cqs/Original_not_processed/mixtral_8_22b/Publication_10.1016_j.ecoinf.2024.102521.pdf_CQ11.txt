Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A major aspect of any data driven project is data availability. Data- 
science thrives on data, and ecoinformatics is no exception. STARdbi’s 
vision of large-scale surveys of species and biodiversity assessment re-
quires that its raw and processed data be available to the entomological 
community and the general public. Typically, however, the generators 
of  data wish  to exhaust  the  publication  potential of  their data before 
making it publicly available. Further, governments, the major sponsors 
of most research, may restrict data sharing to protect political interests.

Similar considerations slowed the development of other data-intensive 
fields.  The  solution  lies  in  regulation,  either  by  top  journals  that 
consider  data  sharing  as  a  publication  requirement,  or  by  funding 
agencies wishing to maximize the impact of their investment (Michener, 
2015). STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. 
We start by raising this issue here.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. It would require further investigation or additional context to provide a direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, some of the cited papers might contain links to relevant datasets within their respective articles. For instance, the paper titled "Bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation using deep learning for computer vision" could potentially include dataset links in its Methods section or supplementary materials. Similarly, the article "Getting the bugs out of AI: advancing ecological research on arthropods through computer vision" might also have relevant dataset links. Lastly, the study "A systematic review on automatic insect detection using deep learning" could offer insights into various datasets used across different research projects. Therefore, I recommend checking these sources for more detailed information regarding the deep learning pipelines and associated datasets.
