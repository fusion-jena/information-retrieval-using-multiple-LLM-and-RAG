testing the CNN models to optimize performance in our study domain. 
Our application is thus a robust test of a scalable citizen science-driven 
approach to collect soundscape recordings, label vocalization reference 
data,  and  apply  modern  deep  learning  technology  for  capturing  bio-
logically  meaningful  species  presence  data  for  basic  science  and  con-
servation efforts.

Many 2D CNNs use well-labeled training and validation data from 
the study domain intended to optimize weights in existing image-based 
architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGGish, MobileNet), i.e., transfer learning. 
These data are usually hard to acquire and thus have low sample sizes. 
This often leads to the use of larger labeled data from outside the study 
domain.  Recent  BirdCLEF  competitions  use  weakly-labeled  audio

For pre-training of our CNN classification models, described in Sec-
tion  2.6,  we  used  recordings  of  bird  vocalizations  in  the  XC  archive. 
These recordings were gathered with various devices and quality, but 
required 100% positive identification of bird species. We used a curated 
dataset of XC recordings from the 2020 Cornell Birdcall Identification 
competition (Howard et al., 2020), from which we selected recordings

to ResNet architectures (Table 2). We note that without selecting the 
best CNN-XC model per species, thus removing the influence of difficult 
species  on  statistics,  average  maximum  F0.5  was  the  same  for  all  ar-
chitectures (0.74). Thus, we conclude that MobileNetv2 could be useful 
for applications requiring smaller CNN architectures.
