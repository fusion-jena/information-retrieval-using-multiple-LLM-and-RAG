memory, we used the incremental training mode to train
and test the DCNN model. On another Dell PowerEdge
C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB
of memory, we used the zero‐start and the incremental
training modes to train and test models, respectively.

RESULTS
The incremental training mode performed consistently with
the zero‐start training mode when the training sample size

At present, few researchers focus on time costs of model
training and the required computing platform. Yousif et al.
(2019) stated that they optimized their model performance,
but model training still failed to complete on a common PC.
In terms of recognition rate, their rate on a 2.6 GHz CPU
computer was 100 frames/minute, which is lower than our
recognition rate (260 images/minute). One possible reason
is that their preprocessing was more complex.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Our method can greatly reduce time and personnel costs in
3 ways. First, using our method to automatically ﬁlter empty
images can greatly save labor and time, and the percentage
of the labor and time savings is the same as the proportion

The DCNN model of our study was the AlexNet model,
which included ﬁve convolutional
layers and three fully
connected layers (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Except for the last
fully connected layer, each layer performed Local Response
Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectiﬁed Linear Unit
(ReLU) activation function processing. Meanwhile, the
ﬁrst, second, and ﬁfth convolutional
layers performed a
downsampling operation (here using the mean pooling
method).

Model Evaluation
Model performance evaluation included both errors and
time costs evaluation. The iteration termination condition
of the model was the same in each round training (i.e., the
loss rate of the model was less than a preset threshold ɛ
−4]). We used the same test set (Test) to

evaluate the performance of models in diﬀerent training
phases. The model error evaluation used three metrics that
included overall error, commission error, and omission
error, which were deﬁned by equations (2), (3) and (4).

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the iteration termination condition of the model was the same in each round of training, where the loss rate of the model was less than a preset threshold. This suggests that some form of gradient descent optimization might have been employed, but without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated which one was used.
