Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, it discusses building a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSS) based on Absorbance Coefficient of Dissolved Organic Matter (aCDOM) and Fluorescence Intensity (Fn). The network has two inputs corresponding to aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), one intermediate layer, and one output layer representing the predictor (TSS). The maximum training time is set to 10,000 iterations, and the training error threshold is 0.001. Sixty-four water samples are used for model calibration, while the remaining samples are employed for validation. The validation accuracy is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R^2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSS values.
