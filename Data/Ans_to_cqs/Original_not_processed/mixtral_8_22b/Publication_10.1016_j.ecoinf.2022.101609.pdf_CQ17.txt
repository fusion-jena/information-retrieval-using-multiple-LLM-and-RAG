4.3.3. Model evaluation 

In this section, the results of the deep learning model developed are 
presented. The model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of the 
three pollutants, but first, an appropriate evaluation metric had to be 
selected.  The  top  metrics  for  regression  problems  are  mean  squared 
error/root  mean  squared  error  (MSE/RMSE),  mean  absolute  error 

Fig. 12. A plot showing the model's training and validation losses against the 
number of epochs. It is worth noting that there was a gradual decrease in both 
losses  as  the  training  epochs  increased  which  indicates  that  the  model  was 
learning. Further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in 
overfitting or no further drop in both losses.

outputs, as other articles will elaborate on developing more advanced 
deep  learning  models.  Future  research  will  integrate  other  relevant 
highway  attributes  such  as  traffic  flow,  highway  terrain,  background 
concentration, and pollutant characteristics such as washout coefficient, 
dispersion rate, and emission, critical to developing highway air quality 
estimation models.

Helpful Answer:

Regularization methods were not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that measures were taken to avoid overfitting during the development of the deep learning model. This is evident from Figure 12, which shows a gradual decrease in both training and validation losses as the number of epochs increases, indicating that the model was learning without overfitting. Furthermore, the text mentions that additional training beyond 20,000 epochs could result in overfitting or no further reduction in losses. Although specific regularization techniques are not discussed, common methods to prevent overfitting include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to prevent overfitting. L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function based on the weights of the neurons, encouraging smaller weights and simpler models. Early stopping terminates the training process once the performance on a validation set stops improving, while data augmentation expands the original dataset by applying random transformations to existing samples.
