Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

5.4. Limitations

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

biodiversity. The habitat maintenance bundle accounted for 32% of the 
total area, mainly constituting woodlands, and was characterized by the 
highest delivery of biodiversity, water conservation, and raw materials, 
whereas it had a moderate delivery of other services.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization methods used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce overfitting. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, whereas L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. Both L1 and L2 regularizations help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.
