To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

their ability to automatically learn and extract low- and high-level visual 
features  directly  from  the  data.  Traditional  methods  often  require 
manual  feature  engineering,  where  domain-specific  knowledge  and 
expertise are used to design handcrafted features. Deep learning algo-
rithms,  on  the  other  hand,  can  learn  feature  representations  directly 
from the raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engi-
neering.  Efficiently  handling  these  multiscale  features  is  crucial  for 
network performance, given their diverse resolutions. Feature pyramid 
networks  (FPNs)  have  made  significant  advancements  by  integrating 
multiscale  features  in  a  top-down  manner.  The  path  aggregation 
network  (PANet)  (Liu  et  al.,  2016)  further  extends  the  FPN  by  intro-
ducing a bottom-up path. Another notable network learning mechanism, 
the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) (Tan et al., 2020),

assigns different weights to each prefusion layer to facilitate adaptive 
feature  fusion.  In  Fig.  6,  we  present  a  novel  feature  fusion  network 
named  the  CRFPN,  which  combines  the  attention  mechanism  with 
feature  fusion.  After  extracting  features  using  the  backbone  network, 
three  output  layers  are  obtained  through  multiple  upsampling  and 
downsampling operations. However, due to the depth of the network, 
some information may be lost, leading to potential negative impacts. To 
address these issues, we propose incorporating a feature layer derived 
from the backbone network, processed by the attention module, as the 
output  layer  for  feature  fusion.  This  approach  not  only  enhances  se-
mantic  information  by  aggregating  additional  characteristics  but  also 
mitigates  the  loss  of  original  information  caused  by  the  increasing 
network depth.

specific steps are outlined: 

Step 1: Select appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for 
data collection. Pre-processing of the acquired data, such as denoising, 
image enhancement, and correction. In order to train and evaluate un-
derwater target detection models, the dataset needs to be labeled. Then 
separate underwater images collected from the underwater environment 
into training and test images. 

Step 2: Prepare hardware servers capable of training deep learning 
models to deploy the YWnet network. This allows learning weights to 
recognize  underwater  organisms.  Tune  the  hyperparameters  of  the 
model such as learning rate, batch size and network depth to achieve the 
best performance of the model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the possible types of models being employed. For instance, the use of convolutional kernels suggests that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) might be involved in the pipeline. Additionally, the reference to feature pyramids and networks like PANet and BiFPN indicates that object detection or segmentation tasks could be part of the pipeline, which typically involve CNN architectures. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
