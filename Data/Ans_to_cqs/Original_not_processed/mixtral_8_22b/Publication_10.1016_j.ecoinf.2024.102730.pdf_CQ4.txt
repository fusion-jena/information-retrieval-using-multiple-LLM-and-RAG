Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization performance of the model. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping an input image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation. Rotation involves rotating the input image by a certain degree, which can help the model learn to recognize objects from different angles. Scaling involves resizing the input image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales. Cropping involves randomly selecting a portion of the input image to use as input, which can help the model learn to focus on important features within the image. Color jittering involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the input image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects under varying lighting conditions.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied during the training phase of the deep learning pipeline, either before or after other preprocessing steps such as normalization or standardization. The specific choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset being used. For example, if the dataset consists of images with significant variations in scale, then scaling may be a useful data augmentation technique. Similarly, if the dataset contains images taken under different lighting conditions, then color jittering may be helpful. Ultimately, the goal of data augmentation is to create a more diverse and robust set of training examples, which can lead to improved model performance and better generalization to new data.
