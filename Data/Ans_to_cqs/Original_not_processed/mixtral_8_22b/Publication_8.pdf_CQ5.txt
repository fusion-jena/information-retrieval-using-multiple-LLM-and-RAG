This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

The most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting
image   features   is   the   Convolutional   Neural   Network   (CNN)   (LeCun   and   Bengio   1995).
A convolutional neural network extracts the features of an image by passing through a
series of convolutional, non-linear, pooling (image downsampling) layers and passes them
to a fully connected layer to obtain the desired output. Each convolutional layer extracts the
visual features of the image by applying convolution operations to the image with kernels,
using a local receptive field, to produce feature maps and passing it as input to the next
layer. The initial layers in the network compute primitive features on the image, such as
corners   and   edges,   the   deeper   layers   use   these   features   to   compute   more   complex
features consisting  of curves and  basic  shapes  and  the   deepest   layers  combine  these

Younis S et al

In order to reduce the training time and, more importantly, because of the small size of the
training dataset, transfer learning (Yosinski et al. 2014) was implemented to initialise the
model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009). Since the initial
layers of a CNN usually learn very generic features that can also be used in new contexts,
pre-trained   weights   can   initialise   the   weights   for   these   layers.   For   the   deeper   layers,
transfer learning is used to initialise the parameter weights pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset and then fine-tuned during training, using the annotated herbarium scan dataset
until convergence.

Helpful Answer:

The primary dataset mentioned in this context is the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009), which is a large-scale hierarchical image database containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. This dataset has been widely used for various tasks related to object recognition and image classification. In this case, the ImageNet dataset is employed for two main purposes: firstly, to initialize the model weights before training, taking advantage of the fact that the early layers of a CNN often learn general features applicable across different domains; secondly, to perform transfer learning, where the pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset are utilized to initialize the weights for the deeper layers of the network, followed by fine-tuning using the smaller annotated herbarium scan dataset until convergence.
