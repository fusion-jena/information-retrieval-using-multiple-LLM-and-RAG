Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

2.3.2. Machine learning

To better understand the inter-annual variability in our results, we
used ML techniques to create models predicting different vegetation
phenology characteristics. Specifically, we trained three separate MLPs:
one to predict the start of the season, another to predict the peak of the
season, and a third to predict the height of the peak season. An MLP is a
type of ANN designed to mimic the way the human brain processes in-
formation. It consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons): an input
layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer which is used to
provide the final predictions. Each node in a layer connects to every
node in the next layer, with each connection having a specific weight.
During training, the MLP adjusts these weights to minimize the differ-
ence between its predictions and the actual outcomes using an algorithm
called backpropagation, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data
(Werbos, 1990).

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to create models that predict different vegetation phenology characteristics. Specifically, three separate Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained: one to predict the start of the season, another to predict the peak of the season, and a third to predict the height of the peak season. MLP is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information. It consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons) and uses an algorithm called backpropagation during training to adjust the weights and learn complex patterns in the data.
