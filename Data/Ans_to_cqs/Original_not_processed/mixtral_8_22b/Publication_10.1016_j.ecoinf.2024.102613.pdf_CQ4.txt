2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

24.  Which features will you need for data preprocessing?  

• Data deduplication (Eliminating excessive copies of data)  
• Data  cleansing  (Removing  incorrect,  corrupted,  incomplete 

data)  

• Data transformation (Changing the structure or format of data)  
• Data compression (Modifying or converting the bits structure 

of data)  

• I do not know  
• Not applicable  
• Other  

25.  In data processing, which one do you choose?  

• Using well-labeled training data (Supervised)  
• Combining  labeled  with  unlabeled  training  data  (Semi- 

supervised)  

• Using unlabeled training data (Unsupervised)  
• I do not know  
• Not applicable  

26.  What kind of data analytics do you need?  

• To know what happen (Descriptive analytics)  
• To know how something happen (Diagnostic analytics)  
• To know what will happen (Predictive analytics) 
• To  know  what  should  be  done  if  something  happens  (Pre-

scriptive analytics)

3.2.2.5. Data processing. In data processing features (see Fig. 18), data 
preprocessing aims to prepare and facilitate data processing operations 
(Salma et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021). The data is cleaned, transformed, 
or  compressed  to  be  ready  for  the  analysis  stage.  Data  cleansing  is  a 
mandatory  feature  in  data  preprocessing,  while  other  features  are 
optional  and  depend  on  the  needs  or  purposes  of  data  analytics. 
Furthermore, in an agricultural system, it is common to see various types 
of  analyzing  the  data,  such  as  descriptive,  diagnostic,  predictive,  or 
prescriptive analytics. Hence, the system uses advanced analytics tech-
niques,  namely  geospatial  analysis,  mathematical  model,  statistical 
analysis, deep learning, and machine learning, depending on analytics 
types or purposes and users’ needs. The machine learning method has its 
own types to analyze the data and specific tasks to generate the analytics

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available for building models without actually collecting new data. They also improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained models.

Flipping involves reflecting images horizontally or vertically. Rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling involves resizing images either uniformly or non-uniformly. Cropping involves removing parts of images to focus on important regions. Zooming involves magnifying images to simulate closer views. Shearing involves distorting images along an axis. Translation involves shifting images along an axis.

These techniques can be applied individually or combined to create even more variations of the original dataset. It is essential to ensure that any transformations applied during data augmentation preserve the semantic meaning of the input data. Otherwise, they may introduce unwanted biases into the trained models.
