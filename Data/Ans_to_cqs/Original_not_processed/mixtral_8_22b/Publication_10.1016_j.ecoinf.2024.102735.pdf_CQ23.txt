included during the model training phase when introducing high-
frequency datasets. This is unsurprisingly as dataset size is often line-
arly related to number of regression trees required to build the models
(Biau and Scornet, 2016). This will enable the RF model to learn more
patterns
in the water quality datasets efficiently and improve
chlorophyll-a predictions. The most occurring max_depth when using
the manually sampled dataset was 28, which increased to 37 when more
datasets were used to train the model. Deeper trees in the continuous
high frequency data allows the model to learn intrinsic water quality
patterns. Less deep trees in the manually sampled datasets helps the
model to learn effectively with the few datasets without overfitting. The
inclusion of the chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable made
little impact on the parameter distribution for both RF_with_Sensor and
RF_w/o_Sensor (Fig. 5). This suggests that increasing predictor numbers

effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions.

While the overall methodology is shown in the flowchart in Fig. 2,
this section provides the general outline of the methodology adopted to
address objective 1.

I. Data Acquisition

i. High frequency (e.g., 15 min) continuous surface water
quality data (e.g., pH, turbidity) were acquired from water
quality sensors-YSI profiler deployed in Boyd Millpond by the
Land Development Division of Greenville County, SC.

The significant parameters tuned to improve model performance are
the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree.
The kernel function aids in finding the nonlinear relationships in the
data without explicitly transforming it into a higher-dimensional space,
epsilon determines the width of the margin, C describes the penalty for
margin violation, and degree controls the complexity of the nonlinear
decision boundary (Ghosh et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:

Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, diverse datasets were utilized, including high-frequency continuous surface water quality data such as pH and turbidity, obtained from water quality sensors deployed in Boyd Millpond. Secondly, the methodology involved developing multiple machine-learning models using randomized subsets of training data. This approach helped capture various patterns within the data, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios. Lastly, the study employed an optimization algorithm called Optuna, which uses complex optimization techniques to find the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the mean squared error. By doing so, the model could be fine-tuned to perform optimally across different datasets, further enhancing its generalizability.
