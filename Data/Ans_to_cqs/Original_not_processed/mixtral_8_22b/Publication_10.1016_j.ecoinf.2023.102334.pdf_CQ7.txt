10. Experiment 

This  experiment  was  conducted  to  develop  and  evaluate  a  deep 
learning  model  for  deer  facial  recognition.  The  model  utilizes  a  CNN 
structure combined with ViT to extract facial features for recognition. 
The training methodology involved initializing the weights randomly, 
setting hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, and using the 
Adam optimization algorithm. The model was trained to classify deer 
faces  into  different  categories.  Ablation  studies  were  conducted  by 
removing different components of the model to analyze their contribu-
tion. The model was evaluated on a test set using metrics like accuracy, 
loss, and a confusion matrix.

In this work, a model that successfully captures global interdepen-
dence was presented while expanding the intrinsic field of perception 
and reducing local redundancy. It is important to note that the devel-
oped network resembles the Transformer architecture used for the text 
classification task. Transformer classifies words at the sentence level by 
taking into consideration their placement and relationships in addition 
to simply adding meaning. Furthermore, the suggested model can more 
effectively solve these concerns since the produced sika deers dataset 
was  vulnerable  to  complicated  backdrops  and  low  levels  of  pattern, 
variety,  location,  and  distribution  of  the  features.  From  the  acquired 
experimental results, it was demonstrated that the introduced model can 
effectively identify sika deers with an accuracy of 97.68% from the deer 
face  dataset.  Relatively  high  accuracy,  better  robustness,  and  better

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about how the data was split for training, testing, or validation purposes. However, typically in machine learning and deep learning models, including those mentioned in the context such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT), the data is often divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, i.e., to learn the relationship between input features and output labels. The validation set is used during the model development phase to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used after the model has been fully developed to assess its performance on unseen data.

The proportion of each subset depends on various factors, such as the total amount of available data and the specific requirements of the project. Common practices include splitting the data into 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. Alternatively, techniques like k-fold cross-validation may be employed to ensure all samples are used for both training and validation.

In conclusion, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, we can infer that the data might have been split into training, validation, and testing sets. However, without further details, we cannot provide exact percentages or methods used for splitting the data in this particular case.
