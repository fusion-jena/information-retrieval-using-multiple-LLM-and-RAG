2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

Species-specific performance did not have a clear association with 
training sample size (Table 1, Fig. 5). Many classes with varying sample 
sizes  achieved  a  similar  strong  performance.  Melanerpes  portoricensis, 
Leptodactylus albilabris, Coereba flaveola each had fewer than 1000 po-
sitive  training  samples  and  AP  >  0.97.  Thus,  depending  on  the  call 

type and potentially confounding signals and noise in the environment, 
strong  performance  is  achievable  with  several  hundreds  of  call  ex-
amples.

For a selected prediction threshold of 0.99, the mean precision and 
recall across species were 0.90 and 0.71, respectively (Table 2). How-
ever,  the  total  precision  and  recall  were  0.98  and  0.83,  respectively, 
further  demonstrating  that  model  performance  is  correlated  with  fre-
quency of species presence. This may be due in part to the slight cor-
relation  between  species  frequency  and  training  sample  size,  though 
strong  performance  was  achieved  for  some  species  without  a  large 
sample size (eg. MEPO, LEAL, COFL). The association between perfor-
mance  and  frequency  of  presence  could  be  further  explained  by  the 
higher  balance  between  presences  and  absences.  Rarer  species  with 
relatively few presences require stronger robustness to noise to achieve 
a low FPR and high precision. Comparing the average-precision scores 
to the precision and recalls at the chosen threshold of 0.99, we find that

other  sites  and  older  years  were  searched  to  increase  the  training 
sample  size  for  certain  species.  78%  of  recordings  were  collected  in 
2019, 11% in 2018, and 11% collected between 2015 and 2018. Most 
recordings were collected in the months March and April, a period of 
high acoustic activity.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are indications of how the model's performance was evaluated after training.

From the context, we can infer that the model's performance was assessed using metrics such as Average Precision (AP), precision, and recall. These metrics were calculated based on the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives produced by the model when making predictions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance was compared across different species, and it was found that there wasn't a clear association between training sample size and species-specific performance. Some species with smaller training sample sizes still achieved strong performance.

Furthermore, the context suggests that the model's overall performance was influenced by the frequency of species presence, which might be related to the correlation between species frequency and training sample size. Rarer species required more robustness to noise to achieve low False Positive Rate (FPR) and high precision.

In summary, while the context does not provide direct information about the monitoring strategy during training, it indicates that the model's performance was evaluated post-training using various metrics and comparing results across different species.
