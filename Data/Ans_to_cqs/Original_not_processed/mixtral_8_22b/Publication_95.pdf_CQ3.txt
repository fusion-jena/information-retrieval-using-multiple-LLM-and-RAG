Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

the collected data. Finally, the deep learning algorithms are evaluated and the challenges
of monitoring IAPS are discussed.

highest recall for a given IAPS and input image size was generally achieved at annotation
sizes between 25% and 65%. Generally, the two image sizes 768 × 1024 and 1536 × 2048
performed similarly on the individual species and outperformed the other three image

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we do see that the study involves annotating images for identifying Individual Aquatic Passive Samplers (IAPS), which suggests some form of object detection or classification annotation technique.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This method involves drawing boxes around objects within an image to identify them. It's commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In this method, every pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to the object it represents. This technique is often employed for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but here, each distinct object gets its own unique identifier. This allows for more precise identification of multiple instances of the same type of object.

4. Polygon Annotation: Used primarily for irregularly shaped objects, polygons are drawn around the perimeter of the object to define its boundaries.

5. Line Annotation: This method is typically used for lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Lines are drawn along roads, lanes, etc.

6. Point Annotation: Points are placed at key locations on an object to denote its presence or position.

Without further details about the specific annotation process used in the study, it's not possible to definitively state which of these methods were applied. But based on the nature of the task - identifying IAPS in images - it seems likely that some form of object detection/classification annotation technique was utilized.
