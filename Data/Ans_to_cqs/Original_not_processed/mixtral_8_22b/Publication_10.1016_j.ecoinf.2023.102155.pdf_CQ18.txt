Sample size can also be critical for model performance. Many studies 
have shown that increasing the sample size is key to balancing out data 
biases  and  increasing  a  model’s  accuracy  (Barry  and  Elith,  2006). 
However, some species can be difficult to observe or live in inaccessible 
places that result in a reduction of the sample size. The studies reviewed 
ˇ
Símov´a (Moudry and ´Imov´a, 2012) that compared how 
in Moudrý and 
models deal with sample size found that most of them cannot accurately 
predict small sample size distributions. There is a trade-off between a 
too-small sample size that can fail to detect any differences and a larger 
sample  that  overestimates  small  differences  (Foody,  2009).  There  is 
evidence that shows that Maxent, which is equivalent to a Poisson point 
process (Renner and Warton, 2013), is a method resilient to a sample 
size as little as even 30 observations (Phillips et al., 2006; Wisz et al.,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that increasing the sample size is crucial for improving model accuracy and reducing biases. It also discusses the use of different methods such as Maxent, knn, kmeans, randomCF, LoopA, LoopT, and hidden observations, but there are no details about their implementation or monitoring strategies.
