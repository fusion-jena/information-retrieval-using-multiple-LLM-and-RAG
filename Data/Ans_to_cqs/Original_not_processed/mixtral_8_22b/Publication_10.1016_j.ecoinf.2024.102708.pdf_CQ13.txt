The  authors  recognize  several  other  limitations  that  could  be 
addressed in follow up projects. First, only two types of neural network 
architectures  were  used,  whereas  additional  benchmarking  could  be 
performed  with  other  types  of  ResNets,  DenseNets  and  transformer 
based models. Secondly, this study does not address the individual in-
sights from the trained models, and the pros and cons of architectures 
and hyperparameters in recognizing specific features of Pacific oysters 
across  mudflats  and  rocky  shore  imagery.  Thirdly,  ablations  studies 
should  be  performed,  showcasing  the  possibilities  for  reducing  the 
complexities of neural network layers and speeding up the computation 
times. And fourthly, if left unmanaged, Pacific oysters can create oyster 
reefs and very dense clusters where younger oysters grow on top of the 
older. In such cases, no gaps are found in the cluster and only the oysters

2.4. Deep learning models 

Two  widely  used  object  detection  models  were  selected  for  com-
parison, YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2021) and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN) (Ren 
et al., 2015). YOLO is a lightweight approach where objects are identi-
fied directly through as single pass, whereas the FR-CNN is a multi-stage 
network approach based on identifying potential regions and then cat-
egorising and discarding some inappropriate regions (Ren et al., 2015). 
For the YOLOv5 model, we also tested three variants, YOLOv5 small, 
YOLOv5  medium  and  TPH-YOLOv5  (Zhu  et  al.,  2021b),  which  is  a 
modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH) 
(Yang et al., 2019).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer. It focuses mainly on comparing different object detection models like YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, along with their variants. However, it doesn't delve into the specific details regarding the hyperparameters employed during training these models.
