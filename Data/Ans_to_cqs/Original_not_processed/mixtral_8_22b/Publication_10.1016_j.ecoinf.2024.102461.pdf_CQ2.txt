in satellite images (Al-hasn and Almuhammad, 2022; Atun et al., 2020; 
Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

Afira  and  Wijayanto  (2022)  conducted  a  study  to  identify  burned 
areas  using  pre-  and  post-fire  Sentinel  2  satellite  images  and  seven 
vegetation  indices  (dNDVI,  dCSI,  dBAIS2,  dNBR,  dNBR2,  dSAVI,  and 
dMIRBI) with two machine learning techniques (XGBoost and Random 
Forest).  The  XGBoost  machine  learning  technique  achieved  the  best 
performance with an AUC value of 0.97, and the dMIRBI, dNBR2, and 
dNBR indices were the most significant contributors to the model. The 
study  also  achieved  satisfactory  results  in  identifying  fire  areas  using 

pre- and post-fire data. Similarly, our research used post-fire data and 
found that NBR and NDWI indices effectively identified fire areas.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that the data used in the pipeline is related to satellite imagery, specifically from the Landsat 8 satellite. This suggests that the data format used could be raster or geospatial data, which is typically used for representing satellite images. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of various spectral bands (such as Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR 1, and SWIR 2) in the analysis, indicating that the data might include multi-band raster files. It is also mentioned that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are utilized, suggesting that the data format could also include drone or aerial photography data. Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is likely in the form of raster or geospatial data, potentially including multi-band raster files and aerial photography data.
