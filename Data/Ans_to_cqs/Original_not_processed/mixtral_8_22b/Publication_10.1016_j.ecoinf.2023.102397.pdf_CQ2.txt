total time (min)

To compare the performances of the software and the similarity of 
the results produced by them with a varying number of records in the 
training set, we followed the standard processes of optimization for each 
software  (see  below)  with  six  different  training  sets  named  after  the 
number  of  positively  manually  validated  recordings  they  contained 
(Table  1):  training  15  (T15),  training  25  (T25),  training  50  (T50), 
training  100  (T100),  training  150  (T150),  and  training  200  (T200). 
Therefore,  for  each  software,  we  created  12  recognizers,  six  for  each 
song (Tables S1 and S2). All presences and absences were always vali-
dated  both  visually  and  acoustically  by  the  same  researcher  (MGU) 
using Arbimon, due to its user-friendly interface. In total, we created 36 
different recognizers, 12 per software (2 songs with 6 different training 
sets each).

All the parameters used for all the recognizers are shown in Table S2. 

2.6. Data analysis: Target set 

The analyses of the target set aimed to detect possible differences 
among the software programs in evaluating the results with regard to 
two different aspects: (1) the possibility that different habitats produce 
more or fewer song detections per day and (2) the possibility that great 
tits in different habitats have different times of vocal activity, regardless 
of the total number of songs. Given that the days and sites used to obtain 
the  data  for  the  training  and  target  sets  were  the  same  for  all  three 
software programs, any differences among the software programs must 
be exclusively due to differences or biases in their detection patterns. On 
the other hand, for the general comparison of the software, we measured 
the  time  each  software  spent  on  analyzing  the  entire  target  dataset 
(32,640 recordings).

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study involves processing acoustic data related to bird songs. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the data format used in this case is likely audio files containing bird sounds.
