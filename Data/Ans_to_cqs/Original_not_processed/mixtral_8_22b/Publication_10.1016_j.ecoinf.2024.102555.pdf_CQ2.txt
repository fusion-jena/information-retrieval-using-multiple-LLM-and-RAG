Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the researchers might be using satellite imagery or remote sensing data based on the mention of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset generated from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS). Additionally, there is a reference to a paper about the verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural networks for flood susceptibility mapping, which suggests that they may also use geospatial data such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), land cover maps, soil type maps, etc. Therefore, it is likely that the researchers are using raster data formats such as GeoTIFF or NetCDF for their analysis.
