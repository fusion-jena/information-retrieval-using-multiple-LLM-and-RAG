landscapes  unit  provision  based  on  expert  data  from  the  literature 
against  those  from  a  field  survey.  Both  models  used  the  Nova  Scotia 
Forest  Ecosystem  Classification  at  10  m  resolution.  The  main  result 
highlighted that the output map informed with field data was 8% more

accurate  than  the  map  inform  by  literature  knowledge  information. 
Other studies have noted that reducing the pixel size from 25 m to 5 m in 
urban areas increases the value of the pollination model (Grafius et al., 
2016). Furthermore, Rayner et al. (2021) found that reducing the pixel 
size from 100 to 10 m yield the prediction of abundance of wild bees by 
43%. As a result, they recommend using the 10 m resolution pixel in an 
agricultural context to make more accurate decisions when interpreting 
the output of the crop pollination model.

3. Result and discussion 

The  proposed  Apis-FIS  for  mapping  the  suitability  of  beekeeping 
involved different data and expert knowledge. Due to the complex na-
ture of the activity, characterized by many relationships that need to be 
translated  into  rules,  we  proposed  to  characterize  from  one  to  many 
subsystems depending on their contribution to beekeeping activity.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that there are two subsystems mentioned: LCW-FIS and LCWT-FIS. However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model or its specific purpose (classification, segmentation, detection) within these subsystems. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the purpose of any deep learning model in this context.

However, considering the overall topic of predicting future opportunities and threats of land-use changes on beekeeping activities in Turkey, it can be speculated that if a deep learning model were employed, it might be used for tasks such as image classification (to classify land use types), object detection (to identify beehives or other relevant features), or semantic segmentation (to delineate specific regions of interest like forests, agricultural lands, etc.). But without further details about the methodology or techniques used in the study, this remains purely speculative.
