their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

Fig. 3. Architecture of the baseline model: the data first passes through the entry flow, then through the middle flow, which is repeated eight times, and finally 
through the exit flow. The adapted first deep separable convolutional (DSC) block in the Exit flow is shown in (a). In this block, the Position Attention module (b) 
receives the local feature A, which is fed into convolutional layers to generate three new feature maps: B, C, and D, respectively. The output feature E is then obtained 
through matrix multiplication and element-wise summation operations.

The model’s activation positions tended to be more dispersed and in 
the long-range in the order and family branches. Conversely, the acti-
vation positions in the genus and species branches exhibited a higher 
degree of concentration and more similarities. However, the model oc-
casionally  detected  some  background  noise.  Overall,  this  shows  the 
model’s proficiency in accurately identifying bird vocalizations despite 
the  need  for  further  research  to  effectively  mitigate  background 
interference. 

5. Discussion 

Previous research has scarcely explored the integration of biological 
information into deep learning classifiers for bird acoustics. This study 
investigated the capability of deep learning algorithms to improve bird 
acoustic  identification  by  leveraging  hierarchical  structures,  with  a 
particular focus on discerning subtle differences in birdcalls within the 
same branch based on the phylogenetic “tree”.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Typically, after training a deep learning model, it can be saved or serialized so that its architecture and learned parameters are stored in a file. Later, this file can be loaded back into memory when needed. As for platform selection, depending on the application, the model could be deployed on various platforms like cloud services, edge devices, mobile applications, etc. However, without specific details regarding the deployment process used in this case, I cannot provide a precise answer.
