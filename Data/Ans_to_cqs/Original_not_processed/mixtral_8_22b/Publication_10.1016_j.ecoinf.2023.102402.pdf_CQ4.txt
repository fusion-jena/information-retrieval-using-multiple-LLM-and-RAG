et  al., 2014). Further details on how to  get our  presence data can be 
found in the Data Availability section. The questionnaire included also 
details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

ORACLE values are averaged over 14 years (2000 to 2014). The data 
are  available  for  global-scale  applications  at  a  spatial  resolution  of  5 
arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator). As seahorses are benthic 
animals (Correia et al., 2018), we chose our predictors from the avail-
able  benthic  layers.  The  benthic  layers  were  produced  with  an  inter-
polation  process  that  considers  the  geographic  position  and  depth  of 
cells, as inferred from a bathymetric layer. The downscaling process for 
benthic layers considered the geo-graphical position and depth of cells 
as inferred from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans (GEBCO). 
Given that focal cells included a range of depth values, the benthic layers 
were  produced  for  the  minimum,  average,  and  maximum  depths  of 
GEBCO.  The  current  gridded  bathymetric  data  set,  the  GEBCO_2023 
Grid, is a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation

in seahorses. To this aim, citizen science surveys, social media, diving 
centers, fishing events, and questionnaires, together with joint research 
efforts and improved scientific data sharing, can help to cost- and time- 
effectively obtain and analyse a large amount of solid information on 
species occurrences (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various methods used to collect and analyze data related to seahorse species occurrences. These methods include using citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. Additionally, the text mentions the use of ORACLE values averaged over 14 years and available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin. It also describes the production of benthic layers through an interpolation process considering the geographical position and depth of cells. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline or machine learning models employed, I cannot provide detailed information on the data augmentation techniques used.
