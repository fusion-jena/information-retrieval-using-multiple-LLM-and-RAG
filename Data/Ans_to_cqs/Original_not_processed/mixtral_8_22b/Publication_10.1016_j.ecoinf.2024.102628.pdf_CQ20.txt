both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

one-group-out  (LOGO)  cross-validation  approach,  where  each  multi-
temporal  transect  was  used  once  as  a  test  set  while  the  remaining 
transects were used for training. The models are retrained for each fold, 
ensuring  that  there  is  no  information  transfer  or  contamination  from 
previous folds. We trained the autoencoder with 15 epochs and used 15 
components in the PLSR to make predictions every iteration.

To expand our dataset, we tripled the image pool for each transect by 
incorporating multi-temporal data. By drawing data from a three-month 
span (March, September and October 2015) across three environments, 
we could more effectively train and test deep learning models, which 
inherently  demand  many  images  to  learn  effectively,  however,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of GPU acceleration might have been used due to the nature of deep learning tasks, especially when working with large datasets and complex architectures such as ResNet-34. Additionally, the use of the fast.ai library suggests that the training process may have leveraged GPU capabilities since fast.ai supports both CPU and GPU training. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the hardware resources used, one cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators were employed during the training process.
