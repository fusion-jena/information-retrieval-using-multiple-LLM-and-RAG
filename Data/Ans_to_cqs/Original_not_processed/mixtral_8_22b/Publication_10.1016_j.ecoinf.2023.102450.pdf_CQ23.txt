train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

using a convolution operation. The refinement module effectively inte-
grated  the  relation  detector  into  the  Siamese  framework  to  suppress 
false-positive detections and filter background interference.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a few-shot learning approach for training their Siamese network due to having an insufficient number of samples in their dataset. This approach involves defining the classification task as an N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contains N different categories, each comprising K labeled samples. In this case, two categories were defined during the training of the tracking tasks: target and non-target. Experiments were then performed using two-way one-shot learning. While these methods do not directly address generalizability concerns such as diverse datasets or cross-validation techniques, they may help improve the model's ability to learn from limited data and potentially enhance its performance across various scenarios.
