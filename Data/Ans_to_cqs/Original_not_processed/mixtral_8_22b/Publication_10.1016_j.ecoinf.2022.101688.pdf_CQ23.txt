Since CNNs require a fixed input size, we studied the vocalisations 
within the presence class for each dataset to determine the character-
istics of the calls which would allow us to create fixed input, which we 
refer to as segments. For example, the Hainan gibbon calls vary from 2 to 
9 s (Dufourq et al., 2021), and thus a suitable input size was 4 s to ensure 
that the smallest call would fit within the segment. A longer input (>4 
seconds) would result in CNNs with more network parameters, an un-
desirable consequence as this would increase the chances to overfit. A 
shorter input (<4 s) would not contain enough information, especially 
in cases where the individual pulses that make up a call are long. A short 
input could omit parts of the call. Preliminary experiments were con-
ducted on the different datasets to minimise the input length as much as 
possible,  thus  minimising  network  parameters.  The  characteristics  of

to match the network's input of 224 by 224. Their models were applied 
to bird and amphibian vocalisations. ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet 
was also used by LeBien et al. (2020) whereby the pre-trained feature 
extractor was used and then two fully connected layers were added to 
the CNN. Zhong et al. (2021) applied ResNet50 to a birdsong dataset

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects related to ensuring robustness can be observed.

Firstly, the study considered multiple datasets, including those containing vocalizations of Hainan gibbons, which varied in duration from 2 to 9 seconds. This suggests that the researchers aimed to include diverse data sources to improve the applicability of their findings.

Secondly, the use of pre-trained networks like ResNet50, which had been trained on large image databases like ImageNet, indicates that transfer learning was employed. Transfer learning allows leveraging knowledge gained from solving one problem to another related problem, thereby improving the performance and generalization capabilities of the new model.

Thirdly, the table comparing the average F1 scores across different network architectures and dataset configurations shows that the results were averaged across 13 unique executions. While this does not directly indicate cross-validation or stratified splitting, it implies that multiple runs were conducted to assess the consistency and reliability of the model's performance.

Lastly, the authors acknowledge the challenges associated with creating and utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bioacoustic research questions, including finding the most optimal model through hyperparameter tuning. Although no direct evidence of cross-validation or stratified splitting is mentioned, addressing these issues contributes to building a more robust and reliable model.
