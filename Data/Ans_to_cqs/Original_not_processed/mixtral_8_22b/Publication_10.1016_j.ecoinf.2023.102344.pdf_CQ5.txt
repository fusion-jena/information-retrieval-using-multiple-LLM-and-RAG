the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase 
factor in accuracy as compared to its equivalent model to Approach 1 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

considerable  model  for  real-time  classification  problems.  As  said,  the 
goal of this study is to develop the BivalveNet which is the best deep 
network  that  could  sensitively  and  specifically  identify  the  sampling 
location of the provided bivalve shell image. Here, six combinations of 
LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM were configured followed by a fully connected 
layer and classification layer (Figs. 4(d) and 4(e)). For all these three 
neural network-based sequence layers, the first, second, and third layers 
consist  of  1000,  500,  and  100  hidden  artificial  neurons,  respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that raw bivalve images were used as inputs to optimize pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. These networks have been previously trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, but the specific dataset used for optimization in this case is not mentioned. Additionally, the table lists various studies that use different datasets, including micro-CT scanning image analysis of fossil and shelly invertebrates, common cockle harvest origin, and cephalopod species identification. However, without more context or explicit mention of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to determine the exact datasets employed.
