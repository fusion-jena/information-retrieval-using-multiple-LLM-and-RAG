classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common knowledge that various optimization algorithms can be employed during the training process of deep learning models. Two popular optimization methods often used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

SGD is an iterative method for optimizing differentiable objective functions, which works well with large-scale datasets due to its computational efficiency. It updates model parameters by computing gradients for each example in the dataset or mini-batch, making small adjustments to weights based on these gradients.

On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques: Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and momentum. Adam maintains individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter, allowing for faster convergence compared to traditional gradient descent methods like SGD.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, commonly used methods include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques help improve model performance and speed up the training process when working with large-scale datasets.
