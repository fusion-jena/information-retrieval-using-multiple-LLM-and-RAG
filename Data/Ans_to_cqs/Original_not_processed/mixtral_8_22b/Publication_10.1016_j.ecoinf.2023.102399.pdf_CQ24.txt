Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This can help mitigate the effects of randomness introduced by various components in the pipeline, including data shuffling, weight initialization, and stochastic optimization algorithms. Additionally, cross-validation, bootstrapping, and other resampling techniques can be employed to estimate model performance more robustly when dealing with randomness.
