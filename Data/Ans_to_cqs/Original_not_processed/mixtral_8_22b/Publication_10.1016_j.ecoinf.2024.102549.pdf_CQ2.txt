CNN has different architectures, such as Le-Net, Alex-Net, Res-Net, 
CapsuleNet, High-Resolution Networks, etc. (Kattenborn et al., 2021). 
This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep 
CNNs  proposed  by  Krizhevsky  et  al.  (2012),  applied  successfully  in 
image scene classification tasks (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021d). 
AlexNet's  triumph  is  attributed  to  practical  strategies  like  ReLU 
nonlinear  layers  and  dropout  regularization  techniques,  making  it 
effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent 
for handling complex problems (Han et al., 2017). Compared to other 
CNN models (e.g., VGG and ResNet), the AlexNet model has a simpler 
structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train 
and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex 
problems (Pu et al., 2019).

CNN represent a cornerstone in the realm of deep learning (Zhou, 
2020),  setting  themselves  apart  from  traditional  machine  learning 
techniques  such  as  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM),  Random  Forest 
(RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Unlike these methods, CNN excel 
in  processing  high-dimensional  imagery,  capturing  intricate  patterns 
and  abstract  features  crucial  for  sophisticated  interpretation  and  pre-
diction tasks (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020). This capability renders 
CNNs particularly valuable in environmental studies, enabling precise 
estimations of cyanobacteria levels and the identification and classifi-
cation of various algal species (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020; Yadav 
et al., 2020).

features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed, which are specifically designed for processing high-dimensional imagery. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of CNNs in environmental studies for estimating cyanobacteria levels and identifying various algal species based on image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily image data. However, without explicit mention of other data formats, we cannot confirm if additional formats such as audio, video, or CSV files were also utilized in the pipeline.
