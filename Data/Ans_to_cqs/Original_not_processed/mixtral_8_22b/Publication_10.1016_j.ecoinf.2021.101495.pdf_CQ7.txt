how the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if 
data augmentation is used.

appropriate images are selected, a second module about the segmenta-
tion and species classification models training and statistical validation 
using 5-fold cross-validation, a third module for the prediction of the 
models, and a last module where results are contrasted with indepen-
dent “ground truth” based on port sampling of landings.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation, which suggests that the dataset was divided into five equal parts or 'folds'. Four of these folds were used for training purposes, while one fold was held back for testing or validation. This process was likely repeated five times, with each fold serving as the test or validation set once. Additionally, the table indicates that different train/test splits were considered during the hyperparameter search, but the exact values used for this split are not specified.
