The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020). 

2.10. Statistical analysis

(Phillips et al., 2006). To ensure the processing of both continuous and 
categorical  discrete  values  in  the  metadata,  selected  algorithms  with 
regression and classification prediction tasks were used. Mapping fore-
casts of different algorithms in the ensemble approach were evaluated 
by assessing the accuracy and performance of the final models.

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to manage randomness and improve reproducibility. In some cases, researchers may also employ methods like cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability due to random initialization or data sampling. Unfortunately, without more information on the specific deep learning pipeline being discussed, it is difficult to provide a detailed response regarding the strategies used to handle randomness.
