include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

At present, bat species identification is still done manually through 
the inspection of spectrograms, but the use of automatic identification 
programs  is  increasing  rapidly,  because  it  speeds  up  the  analysis  and 
allows bat species identification on a large scale to be done by almost 
anyone (Lewandowski and Specht, 2015). Automated analysis first ex-
tracts features from echolocation calls and subsequently use these fea-
tures in machine learning algorithms to identify species or genera. Tests 
of  the  performance  of  commercially  available  and  frequently  used 
automatic  identification  programs  have  revealed  variable  error  rates, 
depending on species or species group (Russo and Voigt, 2016; Rydell 
et al., 2017). The error rate was high in some cases, and the overall result 
raised serious doubts about the reliability of acoustic identification of all 
except the most easy-to-recognize recordings, and this applies to both

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing datasets alone. Instead, the performance must also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples. Additionally, implementing Bayesian algorithms allows users to interact with the software, potentially improving its performance. Therefore, while there isn't a clear description of the monitoring strategy, we can infer that evaluating the model's performance involves assessing its ability to correctly classify real-world examples and possibly utilizing user feedback when employing Bayesian algorithms.
