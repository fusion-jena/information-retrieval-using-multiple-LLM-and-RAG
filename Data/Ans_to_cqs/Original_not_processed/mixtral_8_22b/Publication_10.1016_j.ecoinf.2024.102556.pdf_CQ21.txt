Our subsequent work will focus on further optimizing the detection 
model and implementing migration learning during model training to 
further improve detection accuracy. The FEN will be further modified to 
be  as  lightweight  as  possible  while  guaranteeing  accuracy,  making  it 
more adaptable to UAV platforms with limited computational resources.

where Fk  is the transition matrix from discrete-time k (cid:0) 1 to k, and the 
observation matrix is denoted  as Hk. The random variables  nk  and  vk 
represent process noise and measurement noise, respectively, which are 
assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i. i.d.). 

nk ∼ N(0, Qk), vk ∼ N(0, R)

The process noise covariance Qk  and measurement noise covariance 
Rk  can vary with each time step. Considering the prediction and update 
steps, the KF can be summarized by the following recursive equation: 

̂xk|k(cid:0) 1 = Fk̂xk(cid:0) 1|k(cid:0) 1
Pk|k(cid:0) 1 = FkPk(cid:0) 1|k(cid:0) 1FT

The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (Doll´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for this particular case. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses. In this case, since the authors plan to optimize their detection model and implement migration learning during training, they might use these techniques to assess the impact of their modifications on the model's performance.
