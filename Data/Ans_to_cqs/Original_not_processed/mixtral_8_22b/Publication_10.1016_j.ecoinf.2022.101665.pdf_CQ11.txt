Fig. 5. Examples of estimated sampling intensities (multiplied by 109) for five samples shown in Fig. 2: (a) simple random (cf. Fig. 2(a)); (b) systematic random (cf. 
Fig. 2(c)); (c) moderately clustered (cf. Fig. 2(e)); (d) strongly clustered (cf. Fig. 2(g)); (e) strongly clustered, gapped sample (cf. Fig. 2(i)).

Fig. 2. Examples of studied spatial samples. (a-b) simple random samples; (c) systematic random sample; (d-e) moderately clustered samples; (f-g) strongly clustered 
samples; (h-i) strongly clustered, gapped samples. Except for the systematic sample (c), the sample size always amounted to 5000. The systematic sample had an 
expected size of 5000 but realized samples varied in size between 4998 and 5056.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several links related to climate data, land cover data, elevation data, and other relevant datasets. These are:

* Climate data: <https://chelsa-climate.org/downloads/>
* Land cover data: <https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc>
* Elevation data: <https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem>

These links may be useful resources for building or training a deep learning pipeline, depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, without more context about the nature of the deep learning pipeline being referred to, it is impossible to provide a direct answer to the query.
