2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
I apologize, but based on the given context, there is no information about the use of any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query. However, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing various types of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from different sources like MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset, CDR AVHRR NDVI dataset, and GIMMS NDVI dataset. These datasets are processed using the Google Earth Engine platform. Additionally, SPOT/VEGETATION products, administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are sourced from the Resource and Environmental Data Center. It seems that the main focus of the research is on methodology, visualization, conceptualization, software development, formal analysis, and writing related to these datasets rather than employing specific data annotation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
