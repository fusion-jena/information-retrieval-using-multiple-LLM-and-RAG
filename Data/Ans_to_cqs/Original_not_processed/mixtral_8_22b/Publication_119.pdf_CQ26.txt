a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 increased the testing accuracy of the model. These additional layers—dropout and batch normalization—reduce the over-fitting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data. The hyperparameters in this network—the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size—were further tuned such that the testing accuracy and the kappa were the best among all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.  Figure 4.

The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited.
A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with
segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions. Implementing a U-Net
model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python [39] removed the
requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented
through argis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classiﬁcation accuracies.
This reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection. Hyperparameter
tuning was done to select the best U-Net model [31,34,40]. Based on hyperparameter
optimization, it was found that the best model uses an input patch size of 64 × 64 pixels
and a ResNet-50 backbone [31,34,40].

2.6. Deep Neural Network

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) consists of multiple hidden layers, made up of ‘n’
number of neurons. These neurons are interconnected with neurons of the preceding and
next layer, through some weight (m) and bias (c), such that,

y = mx + c

(1)

The network attempts to learn the values for the various weights and biases, the
parameters of the model, by minimizing the cost function. The choice of the cost function
is important, as this function guides the model in the direction of the correct weights and
biases for accurate predictions. The cross-entropy loss function is used for the DNN model.
The number of neurons and the number of hidden layers all affect the predicting
power of the network. Thus, these parameters were adjusted, resulting in the architecture
seen in Figure 4. The presence of a dropout layer, with a value of 0.23, after hidden

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the authors have taken steps to mitigate potential issues related to data imbalance or bias. For instance, they have mentioned using a limited amount of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018. This suggests that they may have been aware of the need to avoid overrepresentation of certain classes or features in their dataset. Furthermore, they discuss implementing a U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which removes the requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. This could potentially help reduce any inherent biases present in larger datasets. Lastly, they also mention performing hyperparameter optimization to find the best U-Net model, which might include adjustments to account for any data imbalances or biases. While not explicitly stated, these practices suggest that the authors have considered addressing data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline.

However, without more information about the specific methods employed, it cannot be definitively determined whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, or other techniques were utilized to address data bias.
