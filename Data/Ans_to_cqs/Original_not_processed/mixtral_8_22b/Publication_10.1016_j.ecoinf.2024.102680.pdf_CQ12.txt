Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

5. Conclusion

enriching  the  semantic  representation  of  underwater  objects.  DP- 
FishNet  (Liu  et  al.,  2024b)  combines  the  strengths  of  pyramid  vision 
transformers  and  CNNs  in a  dual-path  approach to  effectively extract 
both global and local features from underwater images, which signifi-
cantly  improves  the  network  performance.  However,  these  methods 
generally  require  a  significant  amount  of  underwater  image  data  for 
training and have high computational costs, thus demanding substantial 
computational resources.

Helpful Answer:
The proposed methodology in the given context primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of object detection in underwater environments using a modified version of the YOLOv8 network. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model employed in this pipeline is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). More specifically, the authors use the C2f module for feature extraction within the YOLOv8 network. However, they identify limitations in the original implementation due to the split operation performed on features after convolution, which makes it challenging to capture comprehensive and rich feature information through half of the channel's features. To address this issue, the authors propose modifications involving dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations while maintaining the ability to extract meaningful features.
