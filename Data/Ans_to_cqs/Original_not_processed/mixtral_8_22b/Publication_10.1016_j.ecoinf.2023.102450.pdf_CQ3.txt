train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

branch. Finally, a refined classification confidence score was generated 
using a convolution operation. The refinement module effectively inte-
grated  the  relation  detector  into  the  Siamese  framework  to  suppress 
false-positive detections and filter background interference.

The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines for object detection and image classification tasks, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation would have been employed.

For example, in the paper by Clune et al. (2018), which discusses automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning, it is likely that some form of data annotation technique was used to label the images for training the deep learning models. Similarly, in the paper by Okafor et al. (2016), which compares deep learning and bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition, it is also probable that data annotation techniques were utilized to prepare the datasets for model training.

Bounding box annotation is a commonly used data annotation technique for object detection tasks, where objects within an image are enclosed within rectangular boxes along with corresponding labels. Instance segmentation is another popular data annotation technique used for more precise object identification, where individual pixels belonging to an object are labeled instead of enclosing them within a rectangle.

Without further information regarding the specific papers mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated which data annotation techniques were used. Nonetheless, it can be assumed that some form of data annotation was necessary to prepare the datasets for training the deep learning models discussed in these papers.
