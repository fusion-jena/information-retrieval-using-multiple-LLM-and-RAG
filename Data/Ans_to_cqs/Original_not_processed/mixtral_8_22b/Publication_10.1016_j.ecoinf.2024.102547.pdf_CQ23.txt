consideration spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

stochastic process mainly valued in a Hilbert space. Statistical methods 
for functional data have received a lot of attention from the scientific 
community  (Ramsay  and  Silverman,  2005;  Silverman  and  Ramsay, 
2002) over the last decade. Li et al. (2022) and Koner and Staicu (2023) 
reviewed recently some of the fundamental concepts of the FDA, their 
recent advances, and their impact on practical cases. FDA is an alter-
native to the use of diverse and heterogeneous datasets (Pauthenet et al., 
2017, 2019) of functional, shape or more complex structure. Here we 
studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the 
pelagic environment to take advantage of all the information available 
in the data. Previous work by Diogoul et al. (2020), among others, has 
been  done  on  aggregated  features  from  the  original  data.  Classical

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about any deep learning models used or developed, nor does it mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study involves analyzing large datasets characterized by functional attributes distributed across a spatial domain using various statistical methods, including dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods. These methods consider spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

Functional data analysis (FDA) is mentioned as an alternative approach to handling diverse and heterogeneous datasets of functional, shape, or more complex structures. It appears that the researchers studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the pelagic environment to leverage all the available information in the data. They also referenced previous works that focused on aggregated features from the original data.

While the context does not explicitly discuss the use of deep learning models or measures taken to ensure their generalizability, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, and performing stratified splitting to maintain class balance during training and validation processes. Without further context regarding the development or application of deep learning models, these assumptions cannot be confirmed.
