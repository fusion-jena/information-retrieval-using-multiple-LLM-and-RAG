+is paper aims to predict the SST and the SWH for the
Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this
work should provide scientiﬁc evidence on which model ﬁts
better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random

5. Experimental Results

5.1. Experimental Setup. +e experiments were performed
on a computer running 64-bit Linux OS with two 2.3 GHz
Intel 8-core processors. All of the utilized predictive
models were implemented in the Python programming
language version 3.8.5. Moreover, deep learning model
(i.e., GRU-DNN) implementation is performed using

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors only state that the deep learning model was implemented in Python programming language version 3.8.5 but do not specify any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the information presented in the article.
