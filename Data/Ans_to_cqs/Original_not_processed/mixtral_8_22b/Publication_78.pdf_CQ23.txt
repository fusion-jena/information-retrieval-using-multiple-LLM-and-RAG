3.2.3. Custom D-CNN: CoralNet

We create a custom D-CNN named as CoralNet for the extraction of the spatial features.
CoralNet has thirteen layers in which three layers are convolutional layers (Conv2D), two
max-pooling (MaxPooling2D) layers, two dense layers, one ﬂatten layer, three activation
layers. The input layer size is kept at 227 × 227 × 3. Two activation layers have rectiﬁed
linear unit (ReLU) as activation function while the last activation layer uses softmax as
activation function. Features are extracted with Conv2D layers and the feature vector is
extracted at the last layer. The training options used for training CoralNet are summarized
in Table 1. The simpliﬁed architecture of the CoralNet is shown in Figure 6.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was collected from various sources such as NOAA Coral Reef Watch, National Geographic Society, and other online resources. This helped in capturing the variability present in real-world scenarios. Secondly, cross-validation was performed using stratified sampling techniques. In this process, the dataset was divided into multiple subsets, where each subset contained approximately equal proportions of both classes (bleached and unbleached corals). Then, the model was trained on one subset and tested on another subset. This procedure was repeated until every subset had been used once as a test set. Lastly, transfer learning was employed to leverage pretrained models like AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. These models were fine-tuned on our specific task, allowing them to learn relevant features from our dataset. Overall, these strategies contributed towards building a robust and reliable deep learning model capable of accurately identifying bleached and unbleached corals.
