targeted management of invasive alien species and mitigation of their 
impacts.

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study aims to understand the factors influencing the diversity and abundance of invasive plant species in a specific region. The researchers employed the Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. In this case, the RF model was utilized to examine the relative importance of various environmental and anthropogenic variables on the invasive plant species richness and abundance separately. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study can be understood as a combination of classification (to categorize the impact of each variable) and prediction (to forecast the influence of these variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance). However, without explicit information about the architecture or implementation details of the deep learning model, it cannot be definitively stated whether it serves solely as a classifier, detector, or segmenter.
