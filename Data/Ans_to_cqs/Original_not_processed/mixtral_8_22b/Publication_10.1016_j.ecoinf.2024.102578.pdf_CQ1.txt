Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article discusses a study that utilizes time-lapse cameras and the MegaDetector model for Arctic wildlife monitoring. Time-lapse cameras are used to collect raw data in the form of images, which are then processed using the MegaDetector model. This model is based on ResNet-50 architecture and has been shown to significantly reduce the processing time of image classification loads. Additionally, the article mentions a study comparing camera traps to other sampling tools, indicating that camera traps can be an effective method for collecting raw data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include time-lapse cameras and camera traps.
