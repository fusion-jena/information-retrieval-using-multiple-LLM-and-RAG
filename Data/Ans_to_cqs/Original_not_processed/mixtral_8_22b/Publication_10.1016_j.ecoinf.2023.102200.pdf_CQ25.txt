3.3. Effect of LiDAR point density on the CHM quality

Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context varies depending on their specific applications. However, most of them are primarily focused on object detection, segmentation, or both. For instance, the work by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) uses a deep convolutional neural network for wetlands classification, which involves classifying different types of wetlands. On the other hand, Martins et al. (2021) use machine learning and SLIC for tree canopy segmentation in urban areas, focusing on identifying and delineating individual tree crowns. Similarly, Chen et al. (2021) employ the PointNet of deep learning for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data. Lastly, Do et al. (2022) utilize the bird’s eye view (BEV) Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) algorithm for segmentation purposes, as shown in Figure 9 and Table 6. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary purpose of these deep learning models is either classification or segmentation, depending on the specific application and dataset being analyzed.
