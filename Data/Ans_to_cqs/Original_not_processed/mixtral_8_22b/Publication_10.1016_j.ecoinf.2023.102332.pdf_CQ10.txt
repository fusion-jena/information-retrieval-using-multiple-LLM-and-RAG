Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.1. Data collection 

Wikiloc  offers  over  14  million  hiking  trails  and  has  increasing 
popularity with the number of users increasing from 3.5 million in 2019 
to over 11.3 million in 2023 (https://www.wikiloc.com). The Wikiloc 
platform  allows  users  to  record  and  share  outdoor  trails,  providing 
associated textual descriptions, photographs, and their spatial location 
(latitude and longitude) on the trail. The type of outdoor activity is also 
recorded (hiking, cycling, or running), as well as the date the trail was 
made. Wikiloc has a broad user base and potential as a data source for 
diverse CES (Callau et al., 2019; Chai-allah et al., 2023; Norman and 
Pickering, 2019). While the trails and photographs from this platform 
have  been  used  in  CES  studies  (Callau  et  al.,  2019;  Chai-allah  et  al., 
2023;  Norman  and  Pickering,  2019),  the  textual  data  remained 
unexplored.

Word2vec  is  a  widely  known  word  embedding  technique  (e.g., 
Mikolov et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), and has been a successful tool for 
investigating CES from social media data (e.g., Gugulica and Burghardt, 
2023).  Word2vec  can  be  carried  out  in  two  ways:  by  creating  and 
training your own word2vec space based on two different architectures, 
namely, Skip-gram, which predicts the target word based on a nearby 
word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which learns to predict a 
target word according to its context (Mikolov et al., 2013), or by using 
pre-trained  models (e.g.,  Baroni et al., 2014). Training a new  custom 
word2vec model requires a very large dataset, increases the computa-
tional effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data. 
Therefore,  we  performed  the  semantic  analysis  using  the  pre-trained 
baroni  word2vec  model  provided  at  http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebin

A total of 978 hiking trails were associated with textual data, cor-
responding  to  86.7%  of  the  collected  data,  with  an  average  text 
description  length  of  14  words  (SD  = 28.6).  Half  of  the  trails  were 
recorded in the summer months from June to August (481 trails), and 
34% of the trails fell on weekends (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S3). 
The maximum number of trails uploaded by a single user was 30, while 
207  users  uploaded  only  one  trail  over  the  four-year  study  period. 
Moreover, 183 unique words occurred at least three times in total and in 
a  positive  context,  with  a  cumulative  frequency  of  3553.  The  words 
“view”,  “trail”  and  “walk”  were  the  most  frequent  unigrams  and  no 
negative words such as “sad” or “boring” were found in the final dataset 
(Supplementary Materials, Fig. S4). There was a significant difference in 
the  contents  between  the  two  corpora  Wikiloc  and  ukWaC  (x2  =
