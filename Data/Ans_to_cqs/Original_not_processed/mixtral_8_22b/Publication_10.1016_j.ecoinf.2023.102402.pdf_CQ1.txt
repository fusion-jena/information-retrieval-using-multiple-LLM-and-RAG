in seahorses. To this aim, citizen science surveys, social media, diving 
centers, fishing events, and questionnaires, together with joint research 
efforts and improved scientific data sharing, can help to cost- and time- 
effectively obtain and analyse a large amount of solid information on 
species occurrences (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

Citizen  science  consists  in  the  active  and  direct  involvement  of 
members of the general public in scientific research, particularly data 
collection,  analysis,  and  monitoring,  to  increase  scientific  knowledge 
(Fraisl et al., 2022). In the last decade, increasing partnerships between 
citizens  and  scientists  have  improved  public  engagement  and  conser-
vation efforts worldwide (Kelly et al., 2020). Scuba divers are the marine 
users that contribute the most to some marine citizen science initiatives, 
both in terms of quantity and duration (Lucrezi et al., 2018; Martin et al., 
2016). They can help speed up the scientific process by allowing more 
information to be obtained with reduced costs, time, and resources for 
tasks that would otherwise require more substantial efforts to be per-
formed  at the required temporal  or spatial scales  (e.g., Lucrezi  et  al., 
2018). In addition to data gathering, scuba divers can contribute to data

Helpful Answer:
The text provides several methods used for collecting raw data in the field of marine species occurrences, which could potentially be applied in a deep learning pipeline. These methods include citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. Citizen science involves the participation of members of the general public in scientific research, often contributing to data collection, analysis, and monitoring. Scuba divers, in particular, play a significant role in marine citizen science initiatives due to their ability to gather extensive data over long periods.

In addition to these sources, the text mentions the use of joint research efforts and improved scientific data sharing to collect and analyze a large amount of solid information on species occurrences. This suggests that collaboration among researchers and institutions is another valuable method for obtaining relevant data.

Moreover, the references to specific studies indicate that there may be publicly available datasets related to marine species occurrences. For instance, Ballard et al. (2017) discuss contributions to conservation outcomes by natural history museum-led citizen science, while Broennimann et al. (2012) describe measuring ecological niche overlap from occurrence and spatial environmental data. However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly mention the use of sensors or other types of hardware for data collection.

In summary, the primary methods mentioned for collecting raw data in this context are citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, questionnaires, joint research efforts, and scientific data sharing. Publicly available datasets and potential collaborations with researchers and institutions may also provide valuable data sources.
