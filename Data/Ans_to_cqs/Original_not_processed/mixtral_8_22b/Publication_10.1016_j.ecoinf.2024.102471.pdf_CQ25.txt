As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

4.3. Baseline models 

Hybrid  CNN-LSTM  is  an  architecture  that  combines  the  temporal 
modelling ability of the LSTM with the CNN ability to learn invariant 
features  (Ayadi  and  Lachiri,  2022)  (Yadav  and  Vishwakarma,  2020) 
(Ashraf  et  al.,  2023).  The  combination  of  Convolutional  Neural  Net-
works  (CNN)  and  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  has  the  major 
benefit of learning spatial and temporal data. CNN excels in extracting 
spatial elements like edges, textures, and forms from an input. Mean-
while,  an  LSTM  excels  in  extracting  temporal  data,  like  the  order  of 
words in a phrase or frames in a movie. By combining the two, a model

4.4. Wav2Vec model description 

After pre-processing, the whole dataset is splitted into training and 
testing  of  various  ratio  including  70:30,  80:20  and  90:10  for  strong 
performance  analysis.  As  a  part  of  training  proposed  model,  the  raw 
audio signals of various bird species are given as input to extract 768- 
dimensional  vector  as  features.  In  wav2vec,  after  the  transformer 
block, there are three dense layers with ReLU activation function con-
tains 1024, 512, and 256 hidden neurons, respectively. Followed by, one 
classification layer with sigmoid activation function is kept to decide on 

bird categories as output. For this technique, Adam is used as optimizer 
with initial learning rate of order 10e-5 is appropriate for small weight 
updates throughout the network while fine-tuning. Based on the manual 
fine-tuning process, other hyper parameters such as epochs of 30 with 
batch size 1 is chosen as optimal value. 

4.5. Multi labelling framework

The  motivation  comes  from  success  of  transformer  in  natural  lan-
guage processing (NLP) is the reason for evolution of advanced archi-
tecture called vision transformer. In (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) proposed 
work, the attention mechanism is focused as network's core component 
for capturing long-range relationship among complex structure of image 
data.  The  vision  transformer  processes  each  input  image  as  patches 
where they are treated as tokens by NLP model. Then the model pro-
cessed the tokens to learn more about the visual representation of the 
input. Hence, in comparison to CNN techniques, transformer-based re-
sults  demonstrated  state-of-the-art  performance  by  processing  more 
deep features in limited computational resources. Subsequently, vision 
transformer is applied along with hyper-head attention mechanism for 
bird  sound  recognition  (Tang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  work,  author  has

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is for the classification of bird species based on their calls. This is achieved through the use of hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures, which combine the temporal modeling abilities of LSTM networks with the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, the Wav2Vec model is employed to extract features from raw audio signals of various bird species, resulting in a 768-dimensional vector. These vectors serve as inputs to a series of dense layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by a classification layer with a sigmoid activation function. Ultimately, the goal of this deep learning model is to accurately categorize different bird species based on their unique vocalizations.
