on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

accurately  reflect  the  efficacy  of  bias  correction  (Amaro  et  al.,  2023; 
Redding et al., 2017).

Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 illustrated the bias correction effect ΔD value and 
the average ranking of 100 virtual SDMs across various presence sample 
sizes and bias types for different bias correction methods. Regarding OS 
bias, the aggregation background method outperformed other methods 
when  the  presence  sample  size  n  is  ≤70  and  ranks  second  only  to 
geographic filtering when n > 70. Regarding RD bias, the aggregation 
background  method  outperformed  other  methods  when  n  ≤ 50  and 
ranks second only to geographic filtering or the similarity background 
method when n > 70.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses several methods for addressing sampling biases in ecological datasets, which can also apply to general machine learning pipelines. These include the aggregation background method, geographic filtering, the similarity background method, and others mentioned in Section 4.3. The aggregation background method appears to perform well for both OS and RD biases with smaller sample sizes, while geographic filtering and the similarity background method show good performance for larger sample sizes. It should be noted that these methods focus on correcting biases related to environmental variables rather than class imbalance or diversity issues typically addressed using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
