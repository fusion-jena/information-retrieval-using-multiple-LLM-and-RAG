2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

Still there are issues that should be considered before a specific
detailed framework can be designed. In order to decide on a feature
extraction and recognition detailed steps framework,12 initial experi-
ments were performed on the individuals labeled database. Since we
study a task that has not been studied before, we explore different as-
pects and several directions to tackle them, which naturally, most of
them are abandoned after evaluating the results. Nevertheless, these
initial experiments are important as a base case to study the conditions
that improve the performance, which is the focus of this paper. Based on
the literature survey our initial experiments referred to the following
issues to be decided for the chosen framework: architecture, data
augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement and handling
different poses. The evaluation of the initial experiments results then
guided our design of the follow-up experiments. The initial experiments,
