For  the  configuration  of  LSTM,  after  evaluating  6,  12,  24,  and  48 
previous observations in Casarotti (2021), we decided to fix the tem-
poral window to 12 previous observations (i.e., 2 h of observations) for 
our use case. Given the selected dimension of the temporal window (x) 
and the number of features (y), the dataset is reshaped such that each 
observation consists of x rows and y columns. LSTM was also compared 
with different RNN architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron (Marius 
et al. (2009)) and Gate Recurrent Unit (Cho et al. (2014)). LSTM proved 
to  have  better  results  than  Multilayer  Perceptron,  reducing  RMSE  by 
5.70% for NO and by 15.23% for NO2, as shown in Casarotti (2021).

Several  configurations  of  the  LSTM  architecture  were  tested  and 
compared  in  Casarotti  (2021)  showing  that  a  three  hidden  layer 
configuration of LSTM does not radically improve the performances, and 
with a small training dataset might be affected by overfitting. 

Since the co-location period needs to be as short as possible and deep 
learning models usually need many input data, the implemented solu-
tion  of  LSTM  is  a  trade-off  between  reaching  good  performances  and 
minimizing the dimension of the training data. 

For this reason, the LSTM model implemented has only one hidden 
layer  of  y  neurons,  where  y  is  determined  based  on  the  number  of 
training observations: 

y =

Ns
α*(Ni + No)

where Ns is the number of samples in the training set, Ni is the number of 
input neurons, No  is the number of output neurons, and α is usually a 
value between 5 and 10.
