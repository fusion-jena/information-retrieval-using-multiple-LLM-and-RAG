penalized  regression  techniques  such  as  lasso  regression  (Tibshirani, 
1996) and its extensions including ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 
1970) and elastic net regression (Friedman et al., 2010). These regula-
rization  methods  are  computationally  more  demanding  than  non- 
regularized  methods  but  they  allow  a  more  flexible  optimization  and 
provide other advantages. These methods impose a penalty on param-
eter  coefficients  so  that  they  can  not  grow  too  large.  The  penalty’s 
strength is a key component of regularization techniques that impacts 
model performance and various criteria may be used to tune this penalty 
(Hui et al., 2015). In addition to their use as tools to prevent overfitting, 
regularization techniques, such as lasso and elastic net, can help reduce 
coefficient  instability  in  particular  for  small  sample  size  and  select 
relevant variables while ridge regression and elastic net help to reduce

3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

Fig. 2 shows predictive performance as measured by sumNIMSE for 
Test 1 for the best-performing methods across the combinations of lasso 
penalty  and  bias  correction  use.  The  LoopT  method  performs  consis-
tently  better  than  all  other  methods,  while  the  knn  method  shows  a 
comparable  level  of  performance  with  the  use  of  the  lasso  penalty. 
Meanwhile,  LoopA  performs  poorly  without  lasso  regularization  but 
moderately  well  with  it.  LoopE  also  shows  improvements  with  lasso 
regularization, competing with the best performing methods at all per-
centages of hidden observations. Among the Mixture methods, only knn 
performed well, reaching LoopT’s performance even at 80% of hidden 
observations with lasso  regularization. Adding lasso  differentiates the 
best  performers  (knn,  LoopT,  LoopE,  indiv)  and  worse  performing 
methods.  In  particular,  the  CoinF,  random  and  kmeans  methods  dis-

3.1.1. Relabelling performance measure 

Fig.  1  shows  the  performance  in  classification  as  measured  by 
meanRSS for Test 1 for the best-performing methods across the combi-
nations  of  lasso  penalty  and  bias  correction  use.  The  relative  perfor-
mances of the methods in relabelling are similar regardless of the use of 
a  lasso  penalty or  bias  correction  for  a  low  percentage  of  hidden  ob-
servations.  Indeed,  we  note  that  methods  like  LoopT  and  knn  are 
competitive with the individual method. However, we can emphasize 
that adding the lasso regularization results in better performances—i.e. 
lower meanRSS—especially at 80% of hidden observations for the badly 
performing  methods  (kmeans,  random,  CoinF,  LoopA  and  LoopE) 
(Fig. 1). Adding bias correction does not change the performance of the

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, specifically in the context of regression techniques rather than deep learning pipelines. These include lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net regression.

Lasso regression, introduced by Tibshirani in 1996, imposes a penalty on parameter coefficients to prevent them from growing too large. This technique helps in reducing coefficient instability, especially when dealing with small sample sizes, and assists in selecting relevant variables.

Ridge regression, proposed by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970, is another form of regularization that adds a penalty term to the loss function during model training. This penalty discourages large weights, which can lead to overfitting. Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity among features.

Elastic net regression, developed by Friedman et al. in 2010, is a combination of both lasso and ridge regressions. It uses a mix of L1 and L2 penalties, providing a balance between variable selection and shrinkage properties. Elastic net regression is beneficial when working with high-dimensional data where the number of features exceeds the number of samples.

While these regularization methods are discussed within the context of regression techniques, they share some similarities with regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, dropout is a popular regularization technique in deep learning that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Similarly, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the square of the magnitude of the weights, much like ridge regression.
