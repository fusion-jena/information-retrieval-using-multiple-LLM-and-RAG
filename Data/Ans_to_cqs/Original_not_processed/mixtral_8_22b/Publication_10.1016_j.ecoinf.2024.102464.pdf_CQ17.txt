In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. This can be thought of as training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

Other regularization techniques include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. These methods help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and reduce overfitting.
