regularization parameter used to control model complexity and prevent 
overfitting  by  constraining  the  loss  function  during  training.  The 
parameter ε  controls the model's fault tolerance, that is, the degree of 
tolerance for differences between predicted and actual values of training 
samples. The term σ represents a parameter of a Gaussian kernel or the 
width parameter of a radial basis function kernel. This parameter con-
trols the relationship between support vectors and hyperplanes and af-
fects model complexity and generalization ability. SVR is formulated as 
follows:

3.4. Deep learning 

3.4.1. SLSTM method

Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization to new data. Regularization helps to reduce this problem by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, there are several regularization methods commonly used to prevent overfitting. One such method is Dropout, which randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent co-dependencies among them. By doing so, Dropout encourages the network to distribute its weights more evenly across all input features, making it less likely to rely heavily on any single feature. Another popular regularization technique is L2 regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay. It adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and thus preventing overfitting.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, also known as Lasso Regression, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights. This encourages sparsity in the learned weights, meaning that some weights will become zero, effectively removing those features from the model. Elastic Net regularization combines both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a balance between the two approaches. Early stopping is another common regularization technique, where training is stopped early if validation error starts increasing while training error continues decreasing.

In summary, regularization methods are essential tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Commonly used regularization techniques include Dropout, L2 regularization, L1 regularization, Elastic Net regularization, and early stopping. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired tradeoff between bias and variance.
