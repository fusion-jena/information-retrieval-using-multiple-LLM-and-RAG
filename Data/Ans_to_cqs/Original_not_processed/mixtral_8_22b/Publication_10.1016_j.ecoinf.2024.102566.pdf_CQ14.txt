5.4. Uncertainties in the biomass density estimates

Combined  with  the  distribution  of  different  forest  types  (Fig.  6), 
significant  variations  are  observed  in  both  forest  area  and  biomass 
density. As depicted in Fig. 3, the Qinba Mountains exhibit a larger area 
of broadleaf forest compared to needleleaf forest and mixed forest. The 
southwestern and southeastern parts of the Qinba Mountains are pre-
dominantly covered by a substantial amount of mixed forest, while the 
northern  part  is  dominated  by  broadleaf  forest.  Needleleaf  forest, 
conversely,  is  primarily  found  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  Qinba 

Mountains.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on this context. It would be necessary to have more specific details or additional resources related to the optimization process used in order to give a precise answer.
