They employ supervised classification systems using training datasets to 
minimize  classification  errors  that  could  otherwise  be  caused  by  the 
internal structure of the algorithms (Bousquet et al., 2004; Hastie et al., 
2009). As a result, ML algorithms can be used to improve classification 
performance without needing to articulate the underlying mechanisms 
and assumptions of traditional statistical models (Clarke, 2013; Hastie 
et al., 2009). They can therefore, be trained using both balanced datasets 
(with the same amount or number of pixels sampled for each LULC) and 
imbalanced datasets (with different amount or number of pixels sampled 
for each LULC class) without major classification uncertainties. Here, we 
focus on four ML algorithms, kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF, which have been 
shown to be well suited to LULC classification and to outperform other 
algorithms such as MLC and DT (Khatami and Mountrakis, 2016; Noi

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, including flipping, rotation, and scaling. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of images in the dataset through random transformations like flipping, rotating, zooming, cropping, shifting, and scaling. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model. In this case, since no specific data augmentation techniques were mentioned in the context, one cannot definitively state which techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
