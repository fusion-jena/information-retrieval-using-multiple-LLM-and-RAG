2.3. Modeling framework

4.5. Sample thinning 

Sample  thinning  had  very  little  effect  on  accuracy  or  variable 
importance,  or  mapped  models,  indicating  no  clear  benefits  for 
tampering  with  samples  that  may  provide  information  about  species 
characteristics and responses to the environment. It is not necessary to 
add another modeling step that involves many choices, although thin-
ning  may  be  beneficial  if  thousands  of  samples  were  taken  from  one 
study site. An outcome of reducing samples is that minimum sample size 
thresholds need to be lowered to maintain the same species pool. Sample 
thinning does provide a confirmation that sample size is not as critical as 
capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution. 

5. Conclusions

1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

input variables may be desirable to represent an alternative prediction. 
True physiological tolerances of species are unspecified along with an 
unknown ability of species to compete against other species under future 
climate and land use and disturbance change, which is information not 
captured by current species samples. Although modeling is available to 
answer questions about modeling decisions, species predictions may be 
useful as an indicator of change over time but not likely to be correct.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the purpose of any deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects of modeling, including selecting classifiers such as MaxEnt and Random Forests, which can be used for tasks like classification and regression. In this context, the purpose of these models could be to predict species distributions based on environmental factors. Additionally, the text mentions using resampling techniques and parameter tuning to improve model performance, further suggesting that the goal might be to create accurate predictive models.
