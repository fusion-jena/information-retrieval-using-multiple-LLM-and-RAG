over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is clear from the context that manual validation was performed on various sets of songs (S2 and S3). This suggests that one of the data annotation techniques employed could have been audio labeling or tagging, where experts manually validate and categorize different sounds or songs. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks mentioned in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) implies that some form of supervised learning might have been applied, requiring labeled datasets. Therefore, while the exact technique remains unknown, we can infer that manual validation and possibly audio labeling were part of the data annotation process.
