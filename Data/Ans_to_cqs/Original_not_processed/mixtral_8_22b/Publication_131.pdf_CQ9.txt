ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).
Figure 11 shows the structure of the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

system was made using the TCP/IP protocol. A Python application was designed to train the CNN based on a selected dataset. This cyber system is responsible for interacting with a final user (biologist) who is responsible for ordering the new trainings of the CNNs and new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or on their digital twins to carry out simulations or cooperative classifications. The CPS is being tested at the Doñana Biological Reserve ICTS (DBR) and the Higher Technical School of Computer Engineering (ETSII), both located in the south of Spain and separated by 60 km. Figure 8 depicts the actual location of every part of the system. The physical system is composed of nine IoT nodes spread out over Ojillo Lake, a natural en-vironment in DBR. These nodes create a spanning tree with a base station as a root. The Sensors 2021, 21, 3655

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that a Python application was designed to train the CNN based on a selected dataset. However, it does not provide any details about the source or location of this dataset. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
