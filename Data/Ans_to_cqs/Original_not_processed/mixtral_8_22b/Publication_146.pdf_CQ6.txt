Model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory,
with a training time of 4.9 min per epoch. With the adaptive learning rate algorithms usually yielding
higher model accuracies than static ones [16], the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the
static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Both the basic SGD and its further adaptive developments are
popular in neural network applications [17], but given the ﬁndings of [18,19], which proved Adam’s
usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images), the Adam optimizer is chosen for
the model of this study. Hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully
implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based “Yolt” model [14] suggests
implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. The default parameters of YoloV3 are
0.001, 0.9 and 0.0005 for the learning rate momentum and weight decay, respectively, and we decided

for deep learning. arXiv 2019, arXiv:1910.05446.

to keep these values. There is some variance in proposed learning rate settings, but studies applying
Yolo to aerial imagery have succeeded with a learning rate of 0.001 [12] and have proven that this value
produces higher precision [20]. The model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, resulting in a total
training time of 27 h. Due to limitations in computer memory, the batch size was set at 4.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that common preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, or data augmentation might have been applied, considering the nature of the task being object detection from aerial images.

Image resizing could have been used to ensure all input images were of uniform dimensions, making them compatible with the input layer of the deep learning model. Normalization may have been performed to scale pixel intensities to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1, allowing the model to converge more quickly during training. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping could also have been employed to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

While the context does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps, these assumptions are based on typical practices when working with image datasets for deep learning tasks.
