Unfortunately, MLPs are black-box models. This means that, while
they can approximate any function, it is nearly impossible to determine
the structure of the approximated function. This led to a whole new field
within ML, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), which tries to create
methods that allow human users to understand the predictions made by
an ML model (Vilone and Longo, 2021). Some popular examples include
sensitivity analysis (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014), Local Interpretable Model-
Agnostic Explanations (LIME) (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and SHapley Ad-
ditive exPlanations (SHAP) values (Lundberg et al., 2017). This study
uses the last method, as it is gaining in popularity and is now often used
in ecology. For example, Masago and Lian (2022) use SHAP values to
investigate how inter-annual variation in the daily average temperature
affected the first flowering date or the full blossom date of the Yoshino

Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

After training the MLP models, we computed SHAP values using the
model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are
most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the
greening season. We used the implementation in the Python SHAP
package for this analysis Lundberg et al. (2017).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on all the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the strength of the L2 regularization term as one of the hyperparameters used in the Optuna grid search. Therefore, it can be inferred that L2 regularization was employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, the context does not mention other regularization techniques such as dropout.

In general, regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Regularization methods introduce a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, discouraging complex models and promoting simpler ones. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.

L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the weights as a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging sparse solutions where many weights become zero. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of the weights as a penalty term, favoring smaller weights overall. Dropout is another technique that randomly drops out some neurons during training, preventing the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons and improving its ability to generalize.
