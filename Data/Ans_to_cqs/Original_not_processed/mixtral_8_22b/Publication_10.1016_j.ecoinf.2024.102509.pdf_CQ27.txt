predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The given text discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for improving prediction accuracy by combining multiple data sources. It also mentions the dependency of ANN performance on factors like the quality and quantity of the sample dataset, the number of hidden layers, and the potential issue of overfitting. However, it does not provide details regarding the specific steps taken to deploy a trained deep learning model.
