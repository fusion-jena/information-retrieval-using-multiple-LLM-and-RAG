sample  the  feature  maps  to  reduce  dimensionality.  By  leveraging  the 
hierarchical  representations  learned  through  these  layers,  CNNs  can 
automatically  detect  and  recognize  complex  patterns  and  objects  in 
images. The training process of a CNN involves optimizing the network 
parameters using large-scale labeled training data through techniques 
such as backpropagation and gradient descent (Chouhan et al., 2020). 
Understanding the significant parameters related to CNNs is essential 
because they can drastically affect model performance. The convolution 
operation is meant to apply filters to the input image. It allows CNNs to 
extract local features and capture spatial relationships between pixels. 
The convolution operation is calculated with the help of eq. (3):

hyperparameters.  The  hyperparameters  with  the  current  results  are 
saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the 
proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. 
After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides 
us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN. 
The  overall  complexity  is  dominated  by  the  iterations,  “TC”,  and 
within  each  iteration,  the  operations  depend  on  the  population  size 
“NP”.  Therefore,  the  total  complexity  can  be  approximated  as 
O(TC*NP).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily used for classification tasks. For instance, the table shows various hyperparameters being explored for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are commonly employed for image recognition and classification tasks. Furthermore, the context mentions specific applications such as pine tree classification, plant leaf disease classification, and plant disease classification, all of which fall under the category of classification problems. However, without additional information, I cannot definitively state whether other purposes like segmentation or detection are also part of the intended use cases for these models.
