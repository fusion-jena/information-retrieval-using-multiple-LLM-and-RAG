We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

Fig. 3. The camera trap developed by Soininen et al. (2015) consists of a Reconyx camera that is mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small 
mammals. The camera traps are protected with stones when placed in the field.

GPU,  4  CPUs  and  16  GB  RAM  provided  by  Sigma2  -  the  National 
Infrastructure  for  High  Performance  Computing  and  Data  Storage  in 
Norway. 

We evaluated the model performance on the validation data set and 
the  out-of-sample  test  data  set  by  calculating  model  accuracy  as  the 
number of correct predictions divided by the number of all images as 
well as precision, recall and F1 score for each class (Appendix B):

To overcome the challenge of manually processing huge amounts of 
data, artificial intelligence is increasingly used in ecology, for example 
to  automate  the  classification  of  camera  trap  images  (Christin  et  al., 
2019). Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning models that 
have proven to be especially useful for image recognition (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012) and have been applied for animal detection and classifi-
cation with great success (e.g. Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 
2019; Willi et al., 2019; Zualkernan et al., 2022). These models can for 
example separate empty images from images containing an animal (e.g. 
Beery et al., 2019), identify species, count individuals, and categorize 
animal behaviour with an accuracy that matches or even outperforms 
humans (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). However, developing and training 
neural  networks require  programming  skills  and  have  therefore  often

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model was trained on a dataset consisting of 306, 195, 533, 424, 449, 416, 425, and 528 images, totaling 3276 images. It also states that the model was trained from scratch, which suggests that this dataset might have been created specifically for this project rather than being a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
