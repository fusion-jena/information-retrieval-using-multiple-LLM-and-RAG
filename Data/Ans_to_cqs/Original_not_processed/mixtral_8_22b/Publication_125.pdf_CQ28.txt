Abstract: Satellite images have drawn increasing interest from a wide variety of users, including
business and government, ever since their increased usage in important ﬁelds ranging from weather,
forestry and agriculture to surface changes and biodiversity monitoring. Recent updates in the ﬁeld
have also introduced various deep learning (DL) architectures to satellite imagery as a means of
extracting useful information. However, this new approach comes with its own issues, including
the fact that many users utilize ready-made cloud services (both public and private) in order to
take advantage of built-in DL algorithms and thus avoid the complexity of developing their own
DL architectures. However, this presents new challenges to protecting data against unauthorized
access, mining and usage of sensitive information extracted from that data. Therefore, new privacy
concerns regarding sensitive data in satellite images have arisen. This research proposes an efﬁcient

4.2.1. Data Augmentation

DL is commonly used to build predictive models for image processing and both speech
and text recognition applications. These models are more precise, especially when trained
on large data sets. Prediction is a method of studying available data and then using that
expertise to produce new information that was not available before then. In many cases,
though, these data also contain sensitive information that likewise requires preservation.
Therefore, an important challenge here is to preserve the privacy of such data when they
are sent to the public cloud for processing and analysis. In most cases, personnel computers
lack the performance capabilities needed to process massive satellite images. Therefore, in
order to extract useful knowledge and insights from such RS data, there is a greater need to
perform big data analysis using public cloud servers. With this growing reliance on cloud
services, the privacy of data collected and processed by cloud service providers during DL

The motivation driving this speciﬁc research project is to link two cutting-edge re-
search topics, which are DL and privacy. Indeed, the progress of machine learning (ML)
and its subﬁeld of deep learning (DL) need not come at the expense of privacy or data
security. Therefore, this research work proposes a powerful approach based on PPDL
utilized on big satellite images in order to maintain anonymity and safeguard privacy
related to data. Our main contribution is to apply PPDL for satellite images’ data, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is an approach that has not been proposed or attempted
anywhere in the literature. In particular, the contributions of this study are:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given abstract and table do not provide any explicit information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that users often use ready-made cloud services for taking advantage of built-in deep learning algorithms but does not specify which platforms were utilized. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
