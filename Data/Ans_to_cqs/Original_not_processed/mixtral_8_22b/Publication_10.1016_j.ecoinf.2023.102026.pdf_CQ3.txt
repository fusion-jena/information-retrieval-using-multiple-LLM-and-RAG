1000 m, 2000 m, 4000 m, 6000 m, 8000 m and 10,000 m (Chiaverini 
et al., 2022; Macdonald et al., 2020).

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  (RF;  Breiman 
(2001)) is the most commonly used algorithm (Stupariu et al., 2021). RF 
are  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART)  based  ensemble  ap-
proaches,  which  overcome  limitations  of  CARTs  such  as  model  over- 
fitting.  Additionally,  RF  can  handle  large  numbers  of  predictor  vari-
ables  without  being  affected  by  multicollinearity,  and  can  readily 
accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response 
variables  (Breiman,  2001;  Evans  and  Cushman,  2009;  Kumar  et  al., 
2021). Furthermore, by permutation of variables, RF provides accessible 
measures of variable importance (Cutler et al., 2007; Evans and Cush-
man, 2009).

Independently for each felid, we investigated the most representative 
scale for each covariate by performing univariate Random Forest (RF), 
using  the  full  camera  traps  dataset  and  the  presence-absence  data  as 
response  variable.  For  each  covariate,  we  selected  the  scale  whose 

univariate RF showed the lowest Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error. 

2.4.1. Random forest – model training 

Similar to the GLM approaches, for RF we used two different training 
data selection frameworks. For the first one (hereafter non-bootstrapped 
RF), we trained the RF by using the same training dataset used for the 
non-bootstrapped GLM, composed of randomly selected 80% of camera 
trap locations, and produced species distribution probability surfaces for 
each felid.

For the second approach (hereafter bootstrapped RF), we subsampled 
the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the pres-
ence  and  of  the  absence  locations.  We  then  trained  RF  with  the  sub-
sampled  dataset  and  produced  the  species  distribution  probability 
surface. We reiterated this framework 100 times, replacing each time the 
data used to train the models, and produced 100 different probability 
surfaces.  We  then  obtained  the  final  species  distribution  probability 
surfaces  by averaging the  100 probability surfaces, independently for 
each  felid.  Each  individual  RF  was  produced  by  bagging  the  training 
data, a procedure automatically implemented in the algorithm to reduce 
the variance that might otherwise characterise decision trees. Therefore, 
by bootstrapping also the training data of each RF, we implemented a 
two-stage bagging procedure.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithms, which are a type of machine learning technique often used for classification or regression tasks. The context also discusses the use of these algorithms for investigating the most representative scales for each covariate, and the application of two different training data selection frameworks for RF. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
