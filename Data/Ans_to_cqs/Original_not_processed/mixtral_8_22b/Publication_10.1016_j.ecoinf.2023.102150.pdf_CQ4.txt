Helpful Answer:
The paper by Norouzzadeh et al. (2021) describes a deep learning pipeline used for classifying animal species in camera trap images. In this pipeline, several data augmentation techniques were applied to expand the dataset and improve the performance of the neural network. These techniques included shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears. Shifting refers to moving the image slightly in any direction, while horizontal flip involves flipping the image horizontally. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, zooming involves enlarging or shrinking the image, and shearing involves distorting the image along one axis. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting, which can lead to better generalization on new data.
