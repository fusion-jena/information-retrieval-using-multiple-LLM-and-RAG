The second approach we used to extract embeddings was from the 
pre-trained  BirdNET  model.  The  original  version  of  the  model  was

of length 2048. Model and code was run in Python version 3.10 based on 
the code and methods presented in: https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET 
-Analyzer.

embeddings  from  the  BirdNET  algorithm  performed  comparably  to  MFCCs  for  calls  recorded  at  closer  distances,  whereas  embeddings  from  the  VGGish  model, 
Wav2Vec2 model, and the acoustic indices performed worse. The lack of visible confidence intervals for some points indicates a very narrow confidence interval. 

Fig. 5. Mean and 95% confidence intervals of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for the five feature types as a function of distance for affinity propagation 
clustering (A) and HDBSCAN (B). The lack of visible confidence intervals for some points indicates a very narrow confidence interval. 

Successful clustering was obtained through the use of MFCCs as a feature 
extraction technique, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised classification at 
distances â‰¤150 m (Fig. 6).

We expected higher performance of the embeddings, but a possible 
limitation to our study may be the use of pre-trained CNNs. This may 
have limited the potential performance of using embedding from neural 
networks.  Interestingly,  higher  classification  accuracy was  seen  when 
using  BirdNET,  a  CNN  trained  on  audio  data  of  bird  vocalizations  in 
comparison  with  VGGish  and  Wav2Vec  2.0,  two  models  trained 
respectively on a vast Youtube audio dataset and a human speech audio 
dataset. This suggests that training a model with data input of gibbon 
vocalizations might result in an even better performance of neural net-
works for individual gibbon discrimination. However, such data training 
requires a large dataset and is very computationally costly, hence why 
we chose to test pre-trained CNNs.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there are no explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used in this study. However, it can be inferred that the researchers employed various techniques to improve the robustness and applicability of their models.

Firstly, they utilized multiple pre-trained models like BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec2. These models have been previously trained on diverse datasets, including YouTube audio data and human speech audio data. By employing these pre-trained models, the researchers could leverage the knowledge gained from extensive training on varied datasets, which contributes to the generalizability of the results.

Secondly, the researchers tested different feature extraction techniques, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), BirdNET embeddings, and others. Using various feature extraction methods allowed them to explore how well each method performs under different conditions, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and validity of their findings.

Lastly, the researchers conducted experiments across varying distances (up to 150 meters) between the recording device and the source of the sound. They also evaluated the performance of their models by calculating mean and 95% confidence intervals of classification accuracy and normalized mutual information (NMI) for each feature type. Performing analyses at different distances and assessing the statistical significance of their results helped establish the generalizability of their models.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly mention specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, the researchers did take several steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. These include utilizing pre-trained models, testing various feature extraction techniques, and conducting experiments across different distances.
