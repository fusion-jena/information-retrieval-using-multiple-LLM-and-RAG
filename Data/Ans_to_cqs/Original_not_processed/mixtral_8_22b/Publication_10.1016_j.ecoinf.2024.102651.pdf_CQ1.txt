tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

Given the dataset contains a large number of small objects, utilizing 
CNN for local feature extraction and integrating CAM within CNN allows 
for more effective  detail capture. Simultaneously, ViT  can handle the 
global  context  information  of  images,  making  the  use  of  a  hybrid 
network  for  processing  extracted  features  more  effective  and  thereby 
enhancing  the  performance  of  the  classification  network.  This  hybrid 
network,  combining  the  strengths  of  CNN  and  ViT,  facilitates  more 
efficient image classification and detection. Hybrid networks composed 
of CNN and transformer have classified insect pests with accuracies of 
99.472% and 97.935% across two datasets (Peng and Wang, 2022). The 
Cascade CNN-ViT utilizes Inception-V3 and ResNet-50 for local feature 
extraction of retinal images and employs ViT for global context infor-
mation (Mannanuddin et al., 2023). GhostFormer, combining convolu-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of datasets containing images of microorganisms and Cervidae, suggesting that these datasets could be sourced from various means such as surveys, sensors, or publicly available datasets. For instance, images of microorganisms might come from scientific research using microscopy techniques, while images of Cervidae could originate from wildlife monitoring projects or open databases like iNaturalist. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, one cannot definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data in this case.
