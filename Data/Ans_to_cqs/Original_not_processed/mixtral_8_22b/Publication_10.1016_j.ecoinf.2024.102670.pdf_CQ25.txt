An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

As  mentioned  in  Section  4.1,  performances  may  be  improved  by 
exploiting machine learning. Specifically, (Guo et al., 2021) extracted 
spherical patches around points of interest in the 3D volumetric images 
and used a deep learning-based model to classify the point of interest: if 
the point of interest was a cross-over point/overlap, the incoming fila-
ments were separated. With respect to the approach proposed in (Guo 
et  al.,  2021),  our  approach  is  similar  for  hierarchically  starting  by 
creating an overview and then locally analyzing the points of interest. 
Meanwhile, (Guo et al., 2021) analyzes all potential points of interest by 
considering a patch with a fixed radius, which may be advantageous in 
3D thanks to the volumetric information. We locally analyze the points 
of  interest  considering  their  respective  filament  angles  in  order  to  be 
able to identify overlaps with geometrical branch points far from each

ingful outputs. In Fig. 15a, we apply a window with a size corresponding 
to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-
tations (Fig. 15c &  15d). In Fig. 15c, the separated hyphae have been

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given information, there are two possible purposes. Firstly, in the work of Sharma et al. (2017), the deep learning method could be used for image analysis tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation, specifically for identifying chromosome features in karyotyping images. Secondly, Guo et al. (2021) employed a deep learning-based model for classifying points of interest in 3D volumetric images, where the points of interest could represent cross-over points or overlapping structures. Therefore, the deep learning models serve either as a tool for image analysis or as a classifier for identifying specific features within the input data.
