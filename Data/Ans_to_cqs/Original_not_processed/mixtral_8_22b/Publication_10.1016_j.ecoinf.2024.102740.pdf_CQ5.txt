System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad,

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions using ground data points for machine learning training and employing Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May for classification utilizing the random forest technique. Additionally, the text discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite images for grassland ecosystems monitoring. Therefore, it appears that the study primarily relied on custom datasets rather than commonly used ones like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
