Since 2000, the effect of human activities on NDVI has intensified 
nationwide. In several areas, the average impact is >30%, and human 
activities in most areas act as a positive role to increase local vegetation 
coverage.  The  area  that  mostly  affected  by  human  activities  is  the 
middle reaches of the Yellow River, and human activities have promoted 
the growth of vegetation in this region. The primary reason is due to the 
grain-for-green  program  effectively  implemented  in  this  region  since 
1999, consequently, annual sediment yields that Yellow River delivered 
to marine sink reduced from 1.6 billion tons to the present 140 million 
tons.  The  Green-for-Grain  Project  significantly  increased  vegetation 
cover and restored the ecological function across the Loess Plateau (Liu 
et  al.,  2018).  Vegetation  coverage  in  hilly  and  gully  areas  has  been 
significantly improved, and a huge number of soil and water conserva-
