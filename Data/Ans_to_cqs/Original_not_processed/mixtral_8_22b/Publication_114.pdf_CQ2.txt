In the past few years, CNNs have been a hot topic in the ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation. Since the
publication of AlexNet [38], a number of classical CNN architectures have been proposed, including
VGG [39], GoogLeNet [40], and ResNet [41]. VGG can be considered as a deepened version of AlexNet,
which employed small convolutional kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is
easy to use for network modiﬁcation. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number
of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classiﬁers to accelerate network convergence. As a
consequence of the auxiliary classiﬁers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the
depth of networks is a crucial factor that inﬂuences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of diﬀerent
levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In
many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep

the number of bands of the feature maps, while the numbers on the bottom are the size (height and width) of the feature map. To avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network, we performed data augmentation on the tree samples. The tree samples in the form of patches were rotated, mirrored, and flipped randomly. Finally, a total of 5664 tree samples were used for CNN training. Scattered samples (627) and tree samples (304) in12 plots surveyed in the field measurements were used for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment (931 test tree samples in total). The 12 plots were alsoused for diversity mapping assessment.3.4. Forest Species Diversity Mapping Based on the detected individual trees and the classified tree species, the diversity of three parts of the Haizhu Wetland could be mapped.

Deep learning approaches have become powerful tools for feature extraction and image processing
in computer vision [25] and even in remote sensing [26,27]. Deep learning approaches have proved
to be superior to traditional machine learning methods in a number of remote sensing applications.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images or image patches. This is because the context discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are primarily used for image analysis tasks such as image classification. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques like rotation, mirroring, and flipping, which are commonly applied to image datasets. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images or image patches.
