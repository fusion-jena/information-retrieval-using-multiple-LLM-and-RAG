Second,  DTW  searches  for  the  path  which  has  the  minimum  total 
cumulative cost or distance traversing staring at d(1,1) and ending at d 
(n, m) using dynamic programming. At each time step, DTW finds the 
least cost path forward using the following equation (Berndt and Clif-
ford, 1994; Giorgino, 2009): 

Fig. 3. Dynamic programming for determining the least total cumulative distance from the begin and end of time series (left panel). The blue line is the shortest path. 
The Sakoe-Chiba band (purple color) constrains the search for the shortest total cumulative distance within the band during the dynamic programming of dynamic 
time warping (right panel). The band is created with a wind size of 2 along the main diagonal. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the 
reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

The second term of Eq. (3) indicates that DTW searches for the least 
cost  path  horizontally,  vertically,  and  diagonally  from  the  current 
element or cell (i (cid:0) 1, j (cid:0) 1) in a forward way. At each time step, DTW 
finds the closest points at t = (i, j) of two time series for comparisons. 
DTW generates an accumulative cost matrix with D(i, j) as the element at 
the ith row and jth column. Last, DTW determines the least cost shortest 
path  (or  the warp path)  searching  through the  accumulative distance 
matrix D from the location (1,1) to (n, m) (Berndt and Clifford, 1994; 
Giorgino, 2009). The green line is the warping or aligned path, which 
goes through the cells or elements of which the total accumulative dis-
tance is the lowest, that is, going through the lowest valley (green color) 
of the “landscape” (left panel, Fig. 3).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, I can provide some general insights into common postprocessing steps often used in machine learning models. These may include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: In the context of deep learning models, saliency maps are often used to highlight important features in the input data that contribute most to the output prediction.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, it might be necessary to adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, batch size, etc., to improve the model's performance further.

5. Model Interpretation: This involves understanding how the model makes its predictions, which can help build trust in the model and identify potential biases.
