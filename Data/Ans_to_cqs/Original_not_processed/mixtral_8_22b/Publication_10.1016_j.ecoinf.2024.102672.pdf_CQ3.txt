Opposite to other families of ML models that have a narrow range of 
hyperparameters  to  adjust,  ANN  are  defined  by  different  types  of 
hyperparameters,  which  together  with  the  computational  cost  of 
training deep ANN, restricts the options to optimize. On the one hand, 
we have the hyperparameters that define the architecture of the ANN 
(number of layers and number of neurons), while on the other hand we 
have the hyperparameters that control de training process (mainly the 
learning rate, the optimizer, the batch size and the number of epochs 
that the training lasts). In order to avoid an exhaustive search that could 
consume a lot of time, a small dimensional space was initially defined 
and  explored  with  the  original variables.  The initial  hyperparameters 
that composed this space are shown in Table 1. The number of epochs 
was maintained in 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the

Data-driven models are an alternative type of models, among which 
machine learning and deep learning (ML and DL) models stand out in 
recent years. According to Lee et al. (2023) data-driven models applied 
to freshwater ecosystems have been mainly focused on phytoplankton, 
while there is a lack of research in modelling future changes, such as 
climate change and subsequent changes in habitat conditions. A good 
example of a data-driven model focused on algal blooms prediction is 
that  presented  by  Miura  et  al.  (2023).  Nonetheless,  there  are  several 
examples in the scientific literature about ML or DL models designed to 
predict the temperature profile in water masses. Liu and Chen (2012) 
developed ML models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using 
as inputs meteorological conditions to predict the temperature in the 3

An ANN is composed of layers of neurons connected among them. 
The  ANN  architecture  implemented  in  this  work  includes  sequential 
dense  layers  and  dropout  layers.  Dense  layers  are  those  in  which  each 
neuron of a layer is connected to all the neurons of the previous layer. 
Each neuron receives a stimulus (an input) which is processed to pro-
duce  a  response  (an  output).  This  processing  consists  of  assigning  a 
weight to each input. Once these weights are calculated, the product of 
each input and its associated weight (plus a bias) is added, and then an 
activation function must be applied to obtain the output. Dropout layers 
are used to prevent overfitting and they work by randomly setting the 
inputs  to  0  with  a  given  frequency  rate,  which  is  another  hyper-
parameter to tune, at each step during the training. Each dense layer has 
an  associated  activation  function.  As  activation  function,  the  widely

used, which is a stochastic gradient descent method. Then, one of the

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights into common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within images to identify their location. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling every pixel in an image according to the class of the object to which it belongs. It is often used for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of grouping pixels belonging to the same class, it groups pixels belonging to specific instances of classes. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would distinguish between individual cars rather than treating all cars as a single entity.

4. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves identifying key points on objects within images. It is often used for facial recognition tasks.

5. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects within images. It is useful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.
