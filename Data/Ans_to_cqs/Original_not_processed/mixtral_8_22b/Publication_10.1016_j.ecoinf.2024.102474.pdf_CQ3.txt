Recurrent architectures are not the only means for capturing time 
dependencies effectively. In recent years, Transformer-based architec-
tures  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017)  have  led  to  remarkable  successes  in 
numerous applications - besides natural language processing (Jaderberg 
et al., 2015; Meinhardt et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021), including vision 
tasks (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Since transformers are not conceived in 
a  sequential manner, they exhibit multiple advantages over  recurrent 
architectures, including a more direct gradient flow, a higher level of 
parallelizability  (Zeyer  et  al.,  2019)  and  allowing  for  effective  self- 
supervised pre-training schemes (Devlin et al., 2018). In our efforts to 
use  a  Transformer  version  for  video  prediction,  similar  to  Liu  et  al. 
(2020),  we  encountered  significant  memory  limitations  even  after 
decreasing the hidden channel dimension and resorting only to single

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for various tasks such as object detection, classification, and tracking.
