2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

With the proposed deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, soil 
salinity and vegetation can be detected and segmented without the need 
for ongoing field EC measurements, and salinity can be monitored and 
managed automatically. The U-NET method has been used in numerous 
remote sensing image classification-related tasks, such as olive canopy 
extraction (Abo-Ragab, 2014) and the extraction of saline soil (Gu et al., 
2022). Furthermore, this approach has a wide range of applications in 
medical  picture  recognition  and  segmentation  (Ouyang  et  al.,  2023). 
This method has been shown to produce satisfactory outcomes in a range 
of situations. In this study, we added five salinity indices to the original 
5-band multispectral image, increasing the total number of bands. We 
applied  a  deep  learning  modified  U-NET  (MU-NET)  algorithm  to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to deploy their deep learning models. However, there isn't any explicit mention of other cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used for deployment. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GEE platform was primarily used for deploying the deep learning models in this research.
