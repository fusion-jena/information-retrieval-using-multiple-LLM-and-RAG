tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

For a large amount of wildlife images captured by UAV, traditional 
manual  analysis  usually  has  high  labor  costs  and  is  very  time- 
consuming.  Therefore,  automating  UAV  image  analysis  can  greatly 
improve  the  efficiency  of  wildlife  monitoring.  Deep  learning  makes 
classification  (Çalıs¸kan,  2022;  Çalıs¸kan,  2023;  Chouhan  et  al.,  2020) 
more efficient. Deep learning also has achieved great success in auto-
mated  wildlife  monitoring  (Christin  et  al.,  2019;  Kellenberger  et  al., 
2017;  Liu  and  Qu,  2023;  Song  et  al.,  2024;  Wang  et  al.,  2022).  For 
instance, RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN networks are used to detect elk, 
roe  deer,  red  deer  and  wild  boar  (Vecvanags  et  al.,  2022).  YOLOv5 
network  is  used  to  detect  mugger  crocodiles  (Desai  et  al.,  2022)  and 
desert animals (Chen et al., 2023), which have yielded significant re-
sults. Those object detection methods can directly locate and identify

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models mentioned. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it needs to be serialized into a format that can be loaded for use in applications or services. This often involves saving the model architecture and weights to disk using popular formats such as HDF5, ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, etc. Once the model is saved, it can then be deployed onto various platforms depending on the application requirements. These could include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, edge devices, mobile devices, web browsers, etc. Each platform may require different deployment strategies and tools, but common ones include Flask, Django, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, MLflow, etc. Again, this is a general overview and the exact steps would depend on the specific details of the project.
