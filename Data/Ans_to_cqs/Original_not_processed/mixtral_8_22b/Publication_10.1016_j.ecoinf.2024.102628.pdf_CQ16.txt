We  have  also  adopted  a  broader  and  more  conservative  testing 
strategy as in the classification problem (Q1) involving excluding three 
transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically 
one  from  each  target  class  -  "Plateau"  (p),  "White-sand"  (w),  and  "Ri-
parian" (r), cross-validation is the same as before with the classification 
problem  (see  2.5.1).  In  order  to  measure  the  model’s  performance 
across all transects, a cumulative evaluation was also performed. Instead 
of analyzing each iteration separately, we assess the model using coef-
ficient  of  determination  (R2)  between  true  vs  predicted  for  all  648 
multitemporal transects predictions.

We  have  also  adopted  a  broader  and  more  conservative  cross- 
validation strategy to add robustness to the results we present here, as 
we only use ~5% of the data for every iteration in the previous method. 
This strategy involves excluding three multitemporal transects (~17% 
of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically one from each target 
class - "Plateau" (p), "White-sand" (w), and "Riparian" (r). This is done to 
avoid strong imbalances in the training data. As we train less data in 
each  iteration, we  expect  some  decrease  in  model  performance when 
compared to the previous approach. We use the same training parame-
ters from before, also ensuring that each fold was not contaminated from 
previous folds as before. In total, this cross-validation approach involves 
216  unique  iterations,  each  excluding  a  different  combination  of  one 
multitemporal transect from each class. Through these 216 iterations,

rows  and  predicted  classes  are  in  columns.  Correctly  classified  segments  fall

accuracy of 83% when the majority voting strategy is applied, and the objects 
being classified are the eighteen multitemporal (3*150 m) 450 m transects. For 
each multitemporal transect of 450 m, the topographical class predicted most 
frequently (or simply the mode) among all of its 5-m segments is considered the 
final prediction for that multitemporal transect. Weighted F1 Score was 0.83.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that they adopt a broader and more conservative cross-validation strategy, which involves excluding three multitemporal transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration. They also mention that they use the same training parameters from before, ensuring that each fold was not contaminated from previous folds. Additionally, they perform a cumulative evaluation by measuring the model’s performance across all transects using coefficient of determination (R^2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the completion of training might depend on the number of iterations or the stability of the model's performance over time. However, without further details, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
