Understanding  the  computational  cost  and  parameters  of  a  single 
layer allows for precise estimation and control of the total requirements 
of our model. Computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, calcu-
lated considering the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input 
Cin  and output Cout  channels, and the feature map’s height (hout) and 
width  (wout).  FPS  measure  the  model’s  speed,  encompassing  pre-
processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing 
an overall assessment of the model’s efficiency in real-time applications.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used regularization techniques include Dropout, L1 Regularization, and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

L1 Regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. This tends to produce sparse models with few coefficients.

L2 Regularization adds the squared magnitude of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. It helps in reducing the model complexity by shrinking the weights and prevents overfitting.

These techniques can be applied in various stages of the deep learning pipeline such as before or after activation functions, or even within layers themselves. The choice of regularization method depends on the specific problem and dataset being considered.
