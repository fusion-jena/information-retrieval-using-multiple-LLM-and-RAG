Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The data augmentation technique was used in this study, which 
help  to  extend  the  amount  of  information  by  adding  adjusted 
copies of already existing data, and it acts as a  regularizer and 
makes  a  difference  to  reduce  the  overfitting.  While  training, 
before input into the model, each image was randomly sampled 
by  one  of  the  following  options;  the  entire  original  image, 
horizontal  flip,  grayscale,  blur,  noise  and  cropping.  So,  each 
image  was  horizontally  flipped,  grayscale  was  applied  to  25% 
of images, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, 
and for the cropping operation, a patch with the same size as the 
original  image  was  randomly  cropped  from  image.  Some 
examples of the data augmentation step are illustrated in Figure 
3.

3.  METHODOLOGY

In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
image’s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does discuss the use of data augmentation techniques to extend the amount of data available for training the model. Data augmentation can help mitigate issues related to limited or imbalanced datasets, thus potentially addressing some forms of data bias. The described data augmentation process includes applying transformations like horizontal flipping, grayscaling, blurring, adding noise, and cropping to generate new variations of the existing images. These techniques can contribute to creating a more balanced and diverse dataset, indirectly helping to tackle data biases. Nevertheless, without further details about the dataset and its potential biases, it cannot be confirmed if these methods were explicitly employed to counteract data bias.
