network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

The feature extraction stage of the Res_AUNet network, as depicted 
in the left portion of Fig. 3(a), comprises five levels. Each level primarily 
incorporates  two  consecutive  convolutional  feature  extraction  opera-
tions. With the exception of level 5, each level employs max-pooling for 
downsample,  reducing  the  size  of  the  image  feature  map  to  half  its

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the information available that the study focuses on detecting water sun glint in UAV water images. Therefore, it is likely that the raw data was collected using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with cameras or sensors capable of capturing high-quality images of water bodies. Additionally, the context mentions that the WSGD dataset was used for training and evaluating the Res_AUNet network, which suggests that this dataset may have been used as a source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether any additional sources of raw data were utilized in the study.
