Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

1. Introduction

2.2. YoloV3 Model Architecture

The YoloV3 algorithm implemented in this study is based on Darknet-53, a 53-layer deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual connections. The traditional CNN object detectors
function as two stage detectors that ﬁrst have to identify individual regions of interest in the image
and then carry out bounding box detection within these regions. The two-stage detection performs
at competitive levels but at slow speeds, and while the improvements to speed have been made in
further developments such as the Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, they cannot achieve equal training
time to the single stage detection. Yolo is a single stage detector that does not need to divide the image
into separate regions, but instead handles the full image at once and hence the name: You Only Look
Once. This is achieved by creating feature maps consisting of grid cells through a 3 level pyramid-like

for deep learning. arXiv 2019, arXiv:1910.05446.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is object detection. Specifically, it aims to detect ocean objects using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The model employed is called YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), which is a real-time object detection system. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation, unlike other systems that require multiple stages or passes over the same image. This makes YOLOv3 much faster than its counterparts, achieving high accuracy even when dealing with complex backgrounds and difficult circumstances.
