directory by the proposed technique in this study, which is proposed as a 
future work in Section 6. Bespoke semi-supervised ML approaches (e.g., 
SelfMatch in (Xing et al., 2022a)) can be a good candidate for addressing 
this type of research question by extracting features from labelled data 
and comparing them with the features that are obtained from detected 
ISMMMOs based on the semantic information (e.g., (Xiao et al., 2022) 
and  a  feature/distance-based  matching  scheme  (e.g.,  (Xing  et  al., 
2022b)) considering various pose compositions (e.g., (Çalıs¸kan, 2023)). 
The methodology not only distinguishes ISMMMOs from the blank 
background (sea canvas with waves in many different shapes), but also

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or reference to a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined without additional information.
