species (BirdLife International, 2016, see also Table 1). Among the most 
pressing research priorities identified by the IUCN, there is the very little 
information on the reproductive biology, territoriality, and dispersal of 
the species (BirdLife International, 2016). For example, in Brazil we are 
only  aware  of  one  Nighthawk  egg  collected  in  northern  Brazil  in 
September (Snethlage 1935 in Yoon, 2020) with no more information 
available. Moreover, there is no information regarding the incubation, 
parental care, or nestling development of the species (Cleere and Nur-
ney, 1998; Yoon, 2020).

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing the deep learning pipeline used for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact code repository link requested in the query. However, the paper mentioned in the context titled "A pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network" was published in Ecological Informatics in 2020. You may want to look into this publication further or contact the authors directly to obtain more details about their work and potentially access the relevant code repository.
