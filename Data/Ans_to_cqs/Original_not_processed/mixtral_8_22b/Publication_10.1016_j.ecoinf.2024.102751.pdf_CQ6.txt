Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

The values of predictors were finally extracted for the whole study
area in a regular 10 × 10 m square grid and used for wall-to-wall pre-
diction of VWC using the developed GAM model. Figures showing the
spatial distribution of predicted VWC, and its standard error were
created.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve the performance and efficiency of the model. These steps may vary depending on the specific application and dataset, but some common techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data from the dataset. This step ensures that only high-quality data is used for training the model.

2. Normalization: Scaling input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This technique helps to prevent any single feature from dominating the others during training due to differences in scales. Common normalization techniques include Min-Max scaling, z-score normalization, and log transformation.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that contribute significantly to the target variable. This step reduces dimensionality and improves computational efficiency. Techniques such as correlation matrix, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination can be employed for feature selection.

4. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to existing data. This technique increases the size of the dataset and enhances the robustness of the model.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations. One-hot encoding and label encoding are commonly used techniques for encoding categorical variables.

6. Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values with appropriate strategies like mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, or regression imputation.

These preprocessing steps help ensure that the deep learning model receives well-structured and meaningful inputs, leading to better performance and generalization capabilities.
