Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating various metrics such as Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, correlation coefficient, root mean squared error, and standard deviation. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the models, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), bidirectional RNNs (BiRNN), random vector functional link (RVFL), kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and variational mode decomposition (VMD). The best and worst performances of these models are also considered when monitoring their progress during training. Additionally, uncertainty coefficients like U95% and unidirectional RNN (UniRNN) may be employed for further evaluation.
