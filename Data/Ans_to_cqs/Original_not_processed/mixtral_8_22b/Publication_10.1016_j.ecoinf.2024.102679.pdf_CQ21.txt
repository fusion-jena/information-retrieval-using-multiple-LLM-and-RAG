with a 50% probability of occurrence. To avoid any risk of overfitting at 
each  training  stage,  we  selected  the  model  relative  to  the  epoch  that 
gave the best performance on the validation set. During inference, the 
patch  size  was  set  to  1024  × 1,024  pixels  to  accelerate  the  process. 
Further information on the fine-tuning process is described in section 
2.5.2.

The  pre-trained  model  underwent  inference  and  fine-tuning  for  4 
iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL. This iterative 
process served to enhance the model's performance and gather samples 
pertaining to each key species present in the region. The training pro-
cedure for the two first fine-tuning iterations was the one proposed in 
the  original  paper  (Delplanque  et  al.,  2023a)  which  consisted  of  two 
main steps: 1) training the architecture using positive patches for 200 
epochs, and 2) collecting and including hard negative patches, which are 
patches  containing  false  positives,  to  further  train  the  model  for  50 
epochs in order to reduce the number of false positives. During the two 
last fine-tuning iterations, only the second step of the training procedure 
was used. Hard negative patches were created using false positives that 
emerged from the thumbnail classification (step 1 of the SAL). To avoid a

2.5.1. Semi-automatic loop 

The core component of the pipeline was the Semi-Automatic Loop 
(SAL), which integrates both the DL model and a human-expert inter-
preter. The SAL operated by taking aerial images as input and passing 
them through the DL model to harvest point detections. Subsequently, it 
conducted a 256 × 256 pixel crop, centered on each detection, gener-
ating  thumbnails  that received a  rapid examination  during the  initial 
human verification step. This verification step entails manually classi-
fying each thumbnail as either False Positive (FP), True Positive (TP), or 
uncertain object (Fig. 2).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, the postprocessing steps involve several stages. Firstly, the trained model undergoes inference and fine-tuning for four iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL. This iterative process enhances the model's performance and gathers samples pertaining to each key species present in the region. The training procedure consists of two main steps: 1) training the architecture using positive patches for 200 epochs, and 2) collecting and including hard negative patches, which are patches containing false positives, to further train the model for 50 epochs in order to reduce the number of false positives. However, the text does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be inferred that these methods might not have been employed in this particular study.
