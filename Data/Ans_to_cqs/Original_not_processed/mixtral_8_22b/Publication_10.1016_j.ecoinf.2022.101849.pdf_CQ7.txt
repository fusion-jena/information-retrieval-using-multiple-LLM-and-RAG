Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover. 

1.1. The vegetation modelling task

A related research question in ecology and biogeography is how to 
predict the potential natural vegetation (PNV). PNV is the expected state 
of mature vegetation, given a particular set of environmental constraints 
in the absence of human intervention (Chiarucci et al., 2010). At first, 
PNV models were constructed based only on expert knowledge, whereas 
nowadays, various statistical techniques and machine learning methods 
are more widely employed (Hemsing and Bryn, 2012). In Hengl et al. 
(2018), authors evaluate different machine learning methods, such as 
neural  networks,  random  forests,  gradient  boosting,  and  k-nearest 
neighbours,  for  PNV  mapping  in  a  classification  setting.  The  latter 
example  describes  global  PNV  mapping.  However,  most  PNV  studies 
focus on specific areas or regions (Raja et al., 2019; Vaca et al., 2011; 
Hemsing and Bryn, 2012).

Helpful Answer:
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically involve dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets. This division allows for evaluating the performance of the model during training and fine-tuning its parameters.

The training set is used to fit the model by adjusting its weights and biases through backpropagation. It consists of input features and their corresponding output labels.

The testing set is utilized to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. By applying the trained model to the testing set, one can measure its accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other relevant metric.

Lastly, the validation set serves as a means to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. During the training phase, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch or batch. Based on these results, decisions can be made regarding when to stop training, which architecture to use, or what learning rate to apply.

The proportion of data allocated to each subset depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem. A common practice is to allocate around 60-80% of the data for training, 10-20% for testing, and another 10-20% for validation. However, these percentages might vary depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the project.
