assessment  of  the  overall  utility  of  the  ML  bounding  box  model  for 
accelerating the data labelling process.

2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

Fig.  3. Confusion  matrix  showing  the  percentage  of  true  positive  (upper-left 
quadrant),  false  positive  (upper-right  quadrant),  false  negative  (lower-left 
quadrant),  and  true  negative  (lower-right  quadrant)  classification  outcomes 
observed during the experiment. 

3.3. Objective 3: evaluate the effects of ML model performance on tagging 
efficiency

Overall,  the  ML  bounding  box  model  was  92.2%  accurate  on  the 
given data, with 45.2% true positive classifications, 47.0% true nega-
tive, 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative. These outcomes are 
shown in the confusion matrix (Fig. 3). Several additional performance 
metrics  can  be  derived  from  the  observed  classification  outcomes, 
including  precision (the  number of  true positives  relative to true  and 
false positives) and recall (the number of true positives relative to true 
positives and false negatives). The performance was well-balanced be-
tween  precision  and  recall,  with  92.6%  and  91.5%,  respectively.  The 
classes  in  the  dataset  were  also  well-balanced,  with  49.6%  of  images 
containing at least one animal and 51.4% with no animals (empty).

Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. In this study, the ML bounding box model achieved an overall accuracy of 92.2%. The true positive rate or sensitivity, which measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model, was 45.2%. The true negative rate, which indicates the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified by the model, was 47.0%. False positive and false negative rates were 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Precision, calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives, was 92.6%. Recall, computed as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, was 91.5%.
