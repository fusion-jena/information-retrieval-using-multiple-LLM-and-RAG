Commonly used correlation analysis methods, such as the Pearson correlation, cannot accurately 

capture  these  complex  relationships.  To  address  this  deficiency,  MIC  analysis  is  often 

recommended  to  detect  both  linear  and  nonlinear  associations  between  two  variables  in  large 

datasets  (Reshef  et  al.,  2011).  MIC  has  been  extensively  used  to  select  candidate  predictors  for 

machine learning models (Su et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023;

commonly used proxy for algal biomass and a direct indicator to evaluate the ecological state of 

inland  waters.  Among  the  ML  methods,  Random  Forest  (RF)  modeling  emerges  as  a  popular 

ensemble learning method to examine complex relationships, known for its resilience to data noise,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in all folds of the dataset; oversampling, where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from majority classes are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources to ensure representation of different scenarios. These techniques help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve the performance of deep learning models.

Based on the context, it appears that Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) analysis is being used to identify correlations between environmental factors and Chl a levels in Poyang Lake. Machine Learning (ML) techniques like Random Forest (RF) modeling are also employed to predict Chl a levels, which serve as indicators of algal biomass and ecological states of inland waters. While the context does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias, it highlights the use of advanced analytical tools and ML methods to understand complex relationships within large datasets.
