ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

Fourth, at the level of resources, the application that runs the CNN takes 16.4% of the
CPU capacity and 8.7% of RAM. These results let us conclude that the available computing
resources are adequate for running this sort of application.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention some architectural parameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):

- Number of filters per convolution layer: 32 for the first layer, 64 for the second layer, and 128 for the third/final layer.
- Kernel size (height and width of the convolution window): 3x3 for all convolution layers.
- Fully Connected Layer (FC): Consists of 512 neurons.
- Softmax layer: Has the number of units equal to the types of sounds being classified.

These details describe the architecture of the CNN but do not include any information regarding the optimization algorithm, learning rate, batch size, epochs, or other hyperparameters typically associated with training a deep learning model.
