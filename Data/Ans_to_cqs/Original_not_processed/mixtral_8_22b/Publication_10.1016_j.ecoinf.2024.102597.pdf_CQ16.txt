4.3. Model performance 

All algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset, and five EL 
models were established for both the Chla concentration and turbidity: 
RF,  GBDT,  LightGBM,  XGBoost,  and  CatBoost.  Before  tuning  each 
model, we established a benchmark model with default parameters to 
evaluate  whether  parameter  adjustments  had  a  beneficial  impact  on 
model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using 

both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which 
were  implemented  using  GridSearchCV  from  Scikit-learn  and  the 
Hyperopt  library (version 0.2.7).  We selected the best  parameters  for 
each model and compared the results.

Reference

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various 
fields  due  to  its  powerful  ability  to  handle  non-linear  relationships 
(Mohammadi et al., 2023), according to previous surveys, an increasing 
number of studies are attempting to use ML methods to estimate WQP. Li 
et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate 
Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data 
from 2017 to 2019; the results indicated that this model is suitable for 
lakes  with  medium  to  low  Chla  concentrations  (Li  et  al.,  2021). 
Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean 
Color  Network  (OGN)  to  estimate  Chla  concentrations  in  the  Barents 
Sea,  in  comparison  to  Gaussian  Process  Regression,  this  network 
demonstrated  a  5.2%  reduction  in  mean  absolute  error  (Asim  et  al., 
2021). Ensemble learning (EL) is one of the key technologies in the field

RF is the first algorithm selected as a representative of the bagging 
algorithm family, Random Forest (RF) is the first algorithm we selected 
(Breiman,  2001).  Taking regression  as  an example,  its  core idea  is  to 
construct multiple weak learners in parallel and ultimately output the 
result as the average of the weak learners to enhance model accuracy. In 
addition,  we  chose  several  Boosting  algorithms.  The  GBDT,  improves 
upon the initial boosting algorithm by introducing the concepts of fitting 
residuals and sampling (Friendman, 2001). XGBoost, built upon GBDT, 
it  incorporated  a  structural  risk  term  into  the  loss  function  L(y,y ˆ), 
forming the objective functionO(y,y ˆ), XGBoost also introduced a novel 
impurity measure metric, which considers complexity in splitting rules 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Additionally, it employs new tree-building 
processes, such as estimation greedy algorithms, parallel learning, and

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. This can be done manually or automatically through early stopping mechanisms. Other possible criteria could involve reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a target performance level, or exceeding a maximum allowed time limit for training. Without more details, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria were employed in this particular case.
