2.3.2.4. RF: random forest classification. With the RF approach, we used 
the “randomForest” package. We allowed the model to set the number of 
trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) by default so as 
to ensure satisfactory model performance (Duro et al., 2012; Matlhodi 
et al., 2019; Zhang and Roy, 2017). i.e. about 500 decision trees were 
created  by  the  model  under  default  settings,  with  over  3000  training 
samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings.

and  Kappas,  2017).  The  kNN  model  is  a  non-parametric  model  that 
performs  LULC  classification  based  on  the  distance  between  k  closest 
samples drawn from training datasets. The approach depends on thor-
ough image (predictor) pre-processing so as to reduce sampling bias and 
ensure equal treatment of predictors when computing distance (Kuhn 
and Johnson, 2016). The SVM model uses support vectors (i.e. based on 
a subset of training data points closest to decision boundaries) to locate 
optimal decision boundaries that separate two LULC classes (Cortes and 
Vapnik, 1995; Kuhn and Johnson, 2016). The ANN model is a mathe-
matical model developed as an analogy of the human brain. Using an 
interconnected  group  of  responsive  and  conducting  nodes,  the  ANN 
model  mimics,  in  a  very  simplified  fashion,  the  functionality  of  the 
human brain for knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis and problem

Control() function helped to evaluate these tuning parameters for model 
performance. Table S3 shows the parameterization settings (i.e. model 
type,  number  of  tuning  parameters/iterations,  tuning  methods  and 
description) for each of the four ML algorithms.

Helpful Answer:
The study does not provide explicit information regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some steps might have been taken implicitly. For instance, the use of diverse datasets could contribute to better generalizability. In this case, the authors mention using over 3000 training samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings. This suggests that they employed a diverse dataset to train their models. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques may have been applied during the model development process. These are common practices in machine learning to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, which ultimately contributes to better generalizability. Nevertheless, without clear evidence from the given text, one cannot definitively state whether such techniques were utilized.
