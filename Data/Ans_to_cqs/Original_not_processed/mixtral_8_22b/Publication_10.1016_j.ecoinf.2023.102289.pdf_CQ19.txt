Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

An  AI  platform  operates  on  a  Central  Processing  Unit  (CPU)  or 
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It uses MXNet to provide the essential 
modules and functions required for the program operation. 

The  programming  platform  encompasses  four  primary  computa-

tional functions:  

(1)  Analysis  Module:  Responsible  for  conducting  core  analytical 

tasks.  

(2)  Data Filtering Module: Filters irrelevant data.  

(1)  The computer initially read the images and forwarded them to the 

SS model.  

(2)  The SS model produced a pixel count for 150 objects.  
(3)  Any data that fell below a certain threshold were assigned a value 

of zero.  

(4)  Finally,  the  percentages  of  each  element  and  category  were 
calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework. 
The  results  were  then  exported  in  Comma-Separated  Values 
(CSV) format.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

2.3. MXNet and GluonCV 

MXNet  is  an  open-source  AI  platform  that  offers  a  comprehensive 
suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development 
(Chen et al., 2015). MXNet serves as the central computational module; 
when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, it constitutes a 
robust development system. In this study, we used GluonCV to develop 
LaDeco. 

GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which have 
been trained on the ADE20K dataset and are therefore well-suited for 
landscape applications (Ho and Ho, 2022). The ADE20K dataset devel-
oped by the MIT Torralba team contributes significantly to the SS field. 
This dataset focused on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor ob-
jects  (Zhou  et  al.,  2018a,  2018b).  In  this  study,  55  outdoor  visual 
landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used. 

3. Methodology and materials

A.1.1. MXNet platform installation 

LaDeco runs on MXNet's framework, chosen for its wide variety of SS models that meet diverse research requirements. For operation, MXNet 
requires the GluonCV library, which provides pretrained models and computational functions. Both can be installed on their respective websites (see 
https://mxnet.apache.org/ for MXNet installation and https://cv.gluon.ai/ for GluonCV installation). These sites guide the user through automatic 
package installations, thus simplifying the environmental setup. (Note: Users can opt for either CPU or GPU processing. If a GPU is chosen, Cuda and 
Cudnn must be installed in advance to enhance the computation speed.)

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model is built using the MXNet framework. MXNet is an open-source AI platform that offers a comprehensive suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development. It serves as the central computational module when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, forming a robust development system. In this study, GluonCV was specifically used to develop LaDeco. GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, some of which have been trained on the ADE20K dataset, making them suitable for landscape applications.
