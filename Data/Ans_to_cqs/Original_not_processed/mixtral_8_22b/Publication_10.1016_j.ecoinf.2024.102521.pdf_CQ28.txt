Similar considerations slowed the development of other data-intensive 
fields.  The  solution  lies  in  regulation,  either  by  top  journals  that 
consider  data  sharing  as  a  publication  requirement,  or  by  funding 
agencies wishing to maximize the impact of their investment (Michener, 
2015). STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. 
We start by raising this issue here.

A major aspect of any data driven project is data availability. Data- 
science thrives on data, and ecoinformatics is no exception. STARdbi’s 
vision of large-scale surveys of species and biodiversity assessment re-
quires that its raw and processed data be available to the entomological 
community and the general public. Typically, however, the generators 
of  data wish  to exhaust  the  publication  potential of  their data before 
making it publicly available. Further, governments, the major sponsors 
of most research, may restrict data sharing to protect political interests.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. However, some common platforms used for deploying deep learning models include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
