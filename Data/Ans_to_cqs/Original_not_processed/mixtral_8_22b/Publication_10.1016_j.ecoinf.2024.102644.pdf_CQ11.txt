in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

The GBIF repository is a taxonomic and observation data provider 
involved in several data FAIRness initiatives (Lane and Edwards, 2007). 
Unlike other data providers, GBIF has a broad scope across taxonomic 
orders and kingdoms. It currently hosts ~2.5 billion observation data 
records at the global scale. An R package is available to automatise the 
retrieval  of  occurrence  records  containing  taxonomic,  coordinate, 
sighting authorship, and primary source information.

Several large-scale repositories of FAIR biodiversity data are publicly 
available (Candela et al., 2015). Among these, the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility (GBIF) (Lane and Edwards, 2007) and the Ocean 
Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) (Grassle, 2000) are often used 
in ecological and ecosystem models. Data FAIRness is guaranteed by the 
adoption  of  domain-specific  standards  (e.g.,  Darwin  Core  (Wieczorek 
et  al.,  2012))  and  large-scale  e-Infrastructures  providing  high- 
availability access services (Assante et al., 2019; Assante et al., 2022; 
Candela  et  al.,  2015).  These  repositories  include  millions  of  records 
regarding species’ observations across multiple decades, allowing spe-
cies presence and commonness tracking over time. However, these data 
should be used cautiously because they could include sampling biases - 
due to varying sampling efforts and paths over time and space - driving

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository for their study. The GBIF repository is mentioned as a taxonomic and observation data provider involved in several data FAIRness initiatives. Unlike other data providers, GBIF has a broad scope across taxonomic orders and kingdoms, hosting approximately 2.5 billion observation data records globally. Additionally, there is mention of an R package available to automate retrieval of occurrence records containing taxonomic, coordinate, sighting authorship, and primary source information. However, the specific link to the dataset or the deep learning pipeline within the GBIF repository is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I am unable to provide the exact link to the deep learning pipeline or the dataset within the GBIF repository. To find this information, one would need to search for the relevant datasets or pipelines within the GBIF repository itself.
