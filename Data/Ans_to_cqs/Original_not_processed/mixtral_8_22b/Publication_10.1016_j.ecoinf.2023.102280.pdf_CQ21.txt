training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

5.2. Ablation studies 

Data  requirements  are  a  key  consideration  for  many  monitoring 
applications  given  the  lack  of  existing  datasets.  Audio  enhancement 
models  require  training  data  for  fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning  does  not 
necessarily require large datasets. Section 4.1.2 demonstrate that similar 
performance could be achieved using a subset of 100 training examples. 
Data  augmentation  techniques  such  as  superimposing  noise  samples 
should  also  be  considered  as  bioacoustics  applications  typically  have 
abundant  noise  features.  Both  WPD  and  spectral  subtraction  do  not 
require training data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the methodology and ablation studies.

The methodology section mentions the use of deep noise reduction techniques and the generation of training data for fine-tuning by collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles. It also highlights the challenges faced when collecting clean recordings, which might be infeasible or unrepresentative of the wider population.

The ablation studies section emphasizes the importance of considering data requirements for various monitoring applications due to the lack of existing datasets. It suggests that audio enhancement models need training data for fine-tuning, although large datasets are not necessarily required. Data augmentation techniques like superimposing noise samples should also be taken into account, especially for bioacoustic applications with abundant noise features. Additionally, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and spectral subtraction methods do not require training data.

However, none of these sections directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot accurately determine what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
