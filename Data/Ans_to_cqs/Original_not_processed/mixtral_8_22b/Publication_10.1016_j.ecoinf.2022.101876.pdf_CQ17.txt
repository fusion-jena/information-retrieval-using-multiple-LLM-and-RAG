images  that  need  to  be  reviewed  and  analyzed  (Norouzzadeh  et  al., 
2018; Swanson et al., 2015). These data processing tasks often represent 
a significant bottleneck in the research process from the collection of 
images  to  having  useful  information  to  answer  research  questions.  In 
response  to this challenge, many have  turned  to the field  of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to build computer vision models that leverage machine 
learning to help automate these data processing tasks (Christin et al., 
2019; Miao et al., 2019; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; S. Schneider et al., 
2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Thomson et al., 2018; Tuia et al., 2022; VÂ´elez 
et  al.,  2022).  With  rapid  adoption  and  advancement  of  automated 
methods,  the  time-consuming  burden  of  manually  reviewing  and  la-
beling images has been significantly reduced, ultimately reducing the 
lag between data collection and application and alleviating some of the

Network (Faster R-CNN) which first seeks to identify all regions in an 
image  that  contain  an  object  and  then  examines  attributes  of  those 
specific regions to assign objects to a particular class (Ren et al., 2015). 
In other words, the model first searches the image to determine areas 
that  contain  an  object  not  part  of  the  background  scene  and  draws 
bounding boxes around those objects. Then, each object is reviewed and 
assigned  an  object  classification  and  confidence  value  indicating  the 
model's confidence in the selected object class. MegaDetector has been 
trained  using  hundreds  of  thousands  of  images  labeled  by  manual 
human review from a wide variety of ecosystems and classifies objects as 
either an animal (any non-human animal), human (any person), or truck 
(any vehicle) (Beery et al., 2019; Microsoft and for Earth., 2020). This 
two-step  process  of  Faster  R-CNNs  leads  to  slower  processing  speeds

formance which is likely to continue to improve as more training data 
are  made  available  and  new  model  advancements  are  evaluated  and 
modified. We encourage prospective AI users to carry out similar eval-
uations as performed in this study to gain more relevant information on 
model performance specific to their study systems. However, we antic-
ipate the minimum detection size limits we identified are more gener-
alizable to different study systems provided the model is well trained on 
a particular object class (i.e., under ideal conditions, MegaDetector is 
likely to detect animals when they occupy at least 60px in an image) 
(Fig. 3). Other image characteristics such as complex vegetation, poor 
lighting, low image resolution, and unique camera angles are likely to 
decrease  MegaDetector's  overall  performance  (Beery  et  al.,  2018; 
Greenberg, 2020a).

AI tools provide an appealing solution for Big Data challenges asso-
ciated  with  many  camera  trap  studies  and  we  anticipate  they  will 
continue to improve as more training data are incorporated in model 
development.  To  facilitate  this  progress,  however,  inevitably  more 
painstaking manual human review of images will need to occur. While 
no one approach for collecting and processing wildlife camera trap data 
is  likely  to  be  optimal  for  all  study  systems,  our  study  provides  an 

example of how choices of camera trigger settings and image processing 
methods can dramatically influence data available to draw insights from 
and the importance of making well-informed and intentional decisions 
about which methods to use based on study specific conditions.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) in the MegaDetector model, which is a type of deep learning algorithm used for object detection. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting. Although the text does not specifically state whether these techniques were employed in the development of the MegaDetector model, they could potentially be utilized to enhance its performance and generalizability.
