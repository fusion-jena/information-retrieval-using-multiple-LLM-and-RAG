Here, we showcase a full why-what-how workflow in R using a case study on the structure of an
ecological community (a set of co-occurring species) composed of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)
and its two main preys. First, we introduce the case study and motivate the need for deep learning.
Second we illustrate deep learning for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images,
including model training and validation with a dataset of labelled images, and prediction with a
new dataset of unlabelled images. Last, we proceed with the quantification of spatial co-occurrence
using statistical models.

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence in which a machine is taught how to extract and
interpret the content of an image (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012). Computer vision relies
on deep learning that allows computational models to learn from training data – a set of manually
labelled images – and make predictions on new data – a set of unlabelled images (Baraniuk, Donoho,
and Gavish 2020; LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015). With the growing availability of massive data,
computer vision with deep learning is being increasingly used to perform tasks such as object
detection, face recognition, action and activity recognition or human pose estimation in fields as
diverse as medicine, robotics, transportation, genomics, sports and agriculture (Voulodimos et al.
2018).

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that computer vision with deep learning involves teaching machines to interpret the content of images through training data - a set of manually labeled images. This implies that some form of labeling or annotating was performed on the images. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within an image, while semantic segmentation entails assigning each pixel in an image to a class label. Instance segmentation combines both bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and outlined within an image. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined which of these techniques were employed in this particular case study.
