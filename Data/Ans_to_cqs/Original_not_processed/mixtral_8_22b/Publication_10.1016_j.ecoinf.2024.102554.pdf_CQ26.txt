Helpful Answer:
The given context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various methods might have been employed due to the nature of the research involving satellite imagery and remote sensing data. Some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, ensuring that each subset has roughly the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps maintain class balance when training machine learning models.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating examples, while undersampling reduces the majority class size by removing instances. Both techniques aim to achieve better class balance and improve model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from multiple sources or under different conditions to ensure that the dataset represents a wide range of scenarios. In the case of satellite imagery and remote sensing data, this could involve collecting images from various sensors, locations, seasons, or weather conditions.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they may still be relevant considering the nature of the research and the challenges associated with processing large volumes of satellite imagery and remote sensing data.
