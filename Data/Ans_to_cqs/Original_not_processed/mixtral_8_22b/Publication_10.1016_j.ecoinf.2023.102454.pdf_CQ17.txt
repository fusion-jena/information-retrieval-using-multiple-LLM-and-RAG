sumption and economic development. Additionally, due to the low ur-
banization  rate,  sparse  population,  and  lack  of  industries  in  the 
surrounding areas, future development processes should incubate and 
catalyse new industries and business forms with green, low-carbon, and 
eco-cycling as the growth points to enhance carbon sequestration. At the 
same time, we must strictly control the use of coal and use technological 
progress  to  promote  urbanization  development  and  realise  the  con-
struction of a picturesque countryside.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss using a deep learning approach to estimate CO2 emissions from various sectors such as industry, transportation, residential life, agriculture, and services. They also describe how they trained the model using historical data and validated it using cross-validation techniques. While these details suggest that some form of regularization may have been employed, there is no explicit mention of which specific methods were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the regularization methods used in this particular study.

Based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies between them, while L1 and L2 regularizations add penalty terms to the loss function to discourage large weights and encourage simpler models. These methods could potentially have been applied in this study, but without further information, it remains speculative.
