feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

cross-validation. The threshold was derived from the average output of 
the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness 
(Fig. A.1).

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the references cited, it appears that the deep learning model may be used for species distribution modeling or ecological niche modeling. These types of models are often used to predict the potential geographic distribution of a species based on environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and elevation. They can also be used to identify areas where a species is likely to occur based on its known habitat preferences. Some common applications of these models include conservation planning, invasive species management, and disease risk assessment. Without more specific details about the model being discussed, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its exact purpose.
