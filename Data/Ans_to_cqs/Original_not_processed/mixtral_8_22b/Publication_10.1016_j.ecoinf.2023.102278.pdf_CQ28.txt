%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. None of the given sources mention any specific cloud service provider or deployment platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the deep learning model was deployed based on the provided context.
