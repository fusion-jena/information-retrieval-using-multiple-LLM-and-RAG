EffcientDet (Tan et al., 2020) was proposed by the Google Brain team 
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark Microsoft 
Common  Objects  in  Context  (MS  COCO)  dataset.  It  employs  the  Effi-
cientNet as its backbone which is a widely used feature extractor that 
integrates a compound scaling technique that uniformly scales the res-
olution,  depth  and  width  of  the  network.  Thus,  it  ensures  maximum 
accuracy and efficiency under limited computing resources (Kim et al., 
2021).  Based  on  the  model-scaling  technique,  different  models  of 
various dimensions are proposed with different accuracy and efficiency. 
The  EfficientDet  family  consists  of  a  series  of  networks  from 
EfficientDet-D0  to  EfficientDet-D7.  The  network  architecture  of  Effi-
cientDet is shown in Fig. 3. To allow easy and fast multi-scale feature 
fusion,  an  improved  PANet  named  bidirectional  feature  pyramid

where wi  is a learnable weight that can be a scalar (per feature), a 
vector (per channel) or a multi-dimensional tensor (per pixel) and Ii  is 
the  number  of  layers.  However,  the  unbounded  scalar  weight  could 
cause  training  instability,  Therefore,  weight  normalisation  is  used  to 
bound the value range of each weight.

On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some clues can be found regarding the use of various techniques for improving the model's performance and stability.

For instance, the text mentions that EfficientDet uses EfficientNet as its backbone, which integrates a compound scaling technique that uniformly scales resolution, depth, and width of the network. This helps achieve maximum accuracy and efficiency under limited computing resources. Additionally, the EfficientDet family includes several networks of varying dimensions, allowing for different levels of accuracy and efficiency. These aspects suggest that the model has been designed to handle diverse scenarios and resource constraints effectively.

Moreover, the context discusses different methods for feature fusion, including unbounded fusion, softmax-based fusion, and fast normalized fusion. Each method aims to improve the overall performance of the model by combining features from multiple sources efficiently. Weight normalization is employed to bound the value range of each weight and prevent training instability. Similarly, the softmax activation function is utilized to normalize all weights to be a probability within a range of 0 to 1. Although not directly related to ensuring generalizability, these techniques contribute to enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly detail specific measures for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, it provides insights into various strategies adopted to enhance the model's performance, stability, and adaptability across diverse conditions.
