Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Modern  machine-learning  (ML)  methods  can  perform  a  variety  of 
tasks to help meet these challenges. Determining whether an animal is 
present in an image is a binary classification task that can be performed 
via machine learning to filter out false detections from a dataset. Several 
methods have been used to predict whether an image is empty, including 

measurement  of  differences  between  consecutive  images  (Price  Tack 
et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2020), convolutional neural 
networks (Tabak et al., 2019; Tabak et al., 2020), and ensemble learning 
(Yang et al., 2021). Alternatively, object detection models that localize 
target  objects  (animals)  within  an  image  can  be  used  to  filter  empty 
images  (Beery  et  al.,  2019).  In  contrast  to  other  techniques,  this 
approach not only identifies empty images through the absence of target 
objects, but also indicates the location of each target object within an 
image (Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of modern machine learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, including determining whether an animal is present in an image, which is a binary classification task. This task can be accomplished via machine learning to filter out false detections from a dataset.

Some of the mentioned techniques used to predict whether an image is empty include measurement of differences between consecutive images, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble learning. Additionally, object detection models that localize target objects within an image can be used to filter empty images. While these techniques do not specifically address data bias, they contribute to improving the accuracy and efficiency of the data processing pipeline by reducing the number of false positives and negatives.

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, one could consider implementing techniques like stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to balance the dataset. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the trained model performs well across various scenarios and reduces potential biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets.
