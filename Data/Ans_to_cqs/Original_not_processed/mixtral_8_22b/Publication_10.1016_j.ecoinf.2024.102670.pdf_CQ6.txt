An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

As  mentioned  in  Section  4.1,  performances  may  be  improved  by 
exploiting machine learning. Specifically, (Guo et al., 2021) extracted 
spherical patches around points of interest in the 3D volumetric images 
and used a deep learning-based model to classify the point of interest: if 
the point of interest was a cross-over point/overlap, the incoming fila-
ments were separated. With respect to the approach proposed in (Guo 
et  al.,  2021),  our  approach  is  similar  for  hierarchically  starting  by 
creating an overview and then locally analyzing the points of interest. 
Meanwhile, (Guo et al., 2021) analyzes all potential points of interest by 
considering a patch with a fixed radius, which may be advantageous in 
3D thanks to the volumetric information. We locally analyze the points 
of  interest  considering  their  respective  filament  angles  in  order  to  be 
able to identify overlaps with geometrical branch points far from each

to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-
tations (Fig. 15c &  15d). In Fig. 15c, the separated hyphae have been

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps are often required to ensure optimal performance. These steps typically involve preparing the input data so that it can be effectively processed by the neural network. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale. It also improves the convergence speed during training.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the values of input features to fit within a certain range. However, instead of using a standard range, scaling uses a custom range based on the dataset's characteristics. For example, one could use Min-Max scaling to rescale the data between a defined minimum and maximum value.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing noise, missing values, and outliers from the dataset. Noise refers to irrelevant or incorrect data, while missing values occur when some entries in the dataset are empty. Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. Removing these elements ensures that the model learns from accurate and relevant information.

4. Feature extraction: This step involves selecting or creating new features that best represent the underlying patterns in the data. Feature extraction can help reduce dimensionality, improve computational efficiency, and enhance the model's ability to generalize.

5. Augmentation: Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations to existing ones. Common transformations include rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping. Augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training data and reduces overfitting.
