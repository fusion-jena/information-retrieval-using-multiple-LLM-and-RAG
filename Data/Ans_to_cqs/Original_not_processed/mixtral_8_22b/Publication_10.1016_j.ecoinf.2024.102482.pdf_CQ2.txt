Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

Recently,  there  have  been  remarkable  advancements  in  applying 
deep learning technology to predict water quality parameters, such as 
BOD, COD, pH, and temperature, using data collected over an extended 
period (Khullar and Singh, 2022; Prasad et al., 2021; Wai et al., 2022; 
Zheng et al., 2023). However, when it comes to applying biomonitoring 
data for water quality pollution detection, finding relevant cases is still

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited provide examples of different types of data used in deep learning pipelines for ecological applications. For instance, Fernandes et al. (2016) use time series data from sensors to monitor the locomotor behavior of zebrafish. Similarly, Cho et al. (2014) employ textual data for statistical machine translation tasks. On the other hand, Concepcion et al. (2023) utilize images of bivalve shells for species identification and traceability purposes. Furthermore, Dun et al. (2022) apply spatial-temporal data for air quality predictions. Lastly, Mortezavi et al. (2023) use historical hydrologic data for streamflow forecasting. Therefore, the data formats used in these studies include time series, text, images, spatial-temporal data, and structured datasets like CSV files.
