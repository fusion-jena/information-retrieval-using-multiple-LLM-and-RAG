network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

The feature extraction stage of the Res_AUNet network, as depicted 
in the left portion of Fig. 3(a), comprises five levels. Each level primarily 
incorporates  two  consecutive  convolutional  feature  extraction  opera-
tions. With the exception of level 5, each level employs max-pooling for 
downsample,  reducing  the  size  of  the  image  feature  map  to  half  its

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data annotation techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they developed a method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, it can be inferred that some form of pixel-level or semantic segmentation annotation technique might have been employed. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every single pixel in an image with a corresponding class, which could help train a model like Res_AUNet to accurately detect and segment water sun glint areas from the rest of the image. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data annotation techniques used, this remains speculative.
