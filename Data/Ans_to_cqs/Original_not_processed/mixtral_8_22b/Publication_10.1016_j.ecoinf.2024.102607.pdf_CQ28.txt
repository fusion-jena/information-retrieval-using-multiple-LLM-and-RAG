Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The SSA-TPRF model was deployed on the GEE platform, indicating 
that  it  has  good  migration  performance  and  can  be  utilised for  LULC 
mapping,  wetland mapping,  crop mapping,  grassland mapping,  forest 
monitoring,  and  aboveground  biomass  estimation.  The  advent  of  the 
GEE has significantly advanced large-scale scientific research. The GEE, 
a nonprofit cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis, offers an 
extensive  repository  of  Earth  observation  data,  various  classification 
algorithms, and robust cloud-computing capabilities, thereby providing 
an effective solution for processing RS data (Gorelick et al., 2017). The 
GEE's  user-friendly  programming  interface  empowers  users  to  define, 
create,  and  execute  custom  algorithms  tailored  to  their  analytical  re-
quirements  (Pizarro  et  al.,  2022).  This  feature  enables  researchers  to 
conduct  a  wide  range  of  large-scale  scientific  studies,  such  as  LULC

2.2.1. Satellite data 

Landsat-8 satellite data were obtained from the GEE platform (htt 
ps://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_ 
LC08_C02_T1_L2).  Detailed  statistical  information  of  these  images  is 
presented in Table 1. For LULC classification, we selected only six bands: 
blue, green, red, near-infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands. The 
quality assurance (QA) band was pivotal for identifying and removing 
clouds and shadows.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model, referred to as the SSA-TPRF model, was deployed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE is a nonprofit cloud-computing platform designed specifically for geospatial analysis. It provides extensive Earth observation data, various classification algorithms, and robust cloud-computing capabilities, making it an ideal choice for processing remote sensing data. In this case, the GEE platform was utilized for tasks like LULC mapping, wetland mapping, crop mapping, grassland mapping, forest monitoring, and aboveground biomass estimation.
