Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
I do not have enough information to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, based on the available information, it appears that the research paper titled "Improving cloud detection with machine learning" published in Ecological Informatics journal might contain relevant details about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The paper can be accessed using its DOI or by searching for it on the publisher's website. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in the provided context. Therefore, I recommend checking the full text of the paper or contacting the authors directly for more detailed information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
