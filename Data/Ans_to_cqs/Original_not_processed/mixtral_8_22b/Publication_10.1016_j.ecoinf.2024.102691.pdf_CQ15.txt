was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w 
(n), n) represents the process of treating the input feature n. 

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

2.4.1. Depth attention fusion mechanism 

The attention mechanism was used to provide different weights to 
things depending on how significant they are in a certain visual region. 
To  implement  this  mechanism,  many  techniques  like  SE,  CBAM,  Effi-
cient Channel Attention (ECA), Channel Attention (CA), Non-Local, and 
Global Context Networks (GCNet) are used. The attention mechanism in 
the YOLOv5 network is often included in the C3 module or the last layer 
of the backbone. The process of managing the input feature 'n' based on 
its associated weighting, w(n), is represented by Eq. (1) (Jie et al., 2021).

The input part of YOLOv5 uses self-adaptive anchor box computa-
tion, mosaic data augmentation, and image scaling. Input images were 
scaled down to a fixed size (512 × 512) with normalization using self- 
adaptive  image  scaling.  A  high-performance  classifier  is  used  by  the 
backbone benchmark network in YOLOv5 to extract features. The focus 
structure was used as the backbone of architecture to resize the input 
image by using slice operation and fuse it in the channel. This results in 
lowering  the  number of  FLOPs and  parameters. 6 × 6 sized  convolu-
tional layers are more effective on GPUs to use as focus structures in 
YOLOv5.  In  YOLOv5  architecture,  the  neck  part  oversees  boosting 
feature variety and creating useful feature outputs. The head serves as 
both  a  classifier  and  a  regressor,  predicting  of  class  and  position  of 
targets. Three feature layers are created in the head by applying 1 × 1

Helpful Answer:

The text mentions that the models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties. It can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the actual gradient by an estimate thereof. This estimate is computed from a randomly selected subset of the training data.

However, the text does not mention any other specific optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, etc. Therefore, based solely on the given information, we cannot definitively state whether these additional optimization techniques were also employed in the deep learning pipeline.
