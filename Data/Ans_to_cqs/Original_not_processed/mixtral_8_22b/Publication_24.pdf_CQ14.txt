%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The authors mention using a pretrained Resnet50 network but do not discuss any specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined based solely on the given context how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.

Based on the references cited in the Supporting Information section, it can be assumed that standard practices for deep learning models were followed, which may include methods like cross-validation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling. However, without further details, it remains uncertain what specific hyperparameter tuning strategies were employed.
