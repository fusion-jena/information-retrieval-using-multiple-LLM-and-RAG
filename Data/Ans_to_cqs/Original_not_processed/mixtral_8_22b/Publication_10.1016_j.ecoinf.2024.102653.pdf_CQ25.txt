2. Methods 

Fig. 2 summarizes a series of processes in designing a deep-learning 
architecture that acts as a toxicovigilance tool. Subsequent sections will 
provide a comprehensive description of each section. 

2.1. Data collection

2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

●  Confusion Matrix

The model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset in 
order to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory 
classification  metrics.  These  subsets  corresponded  to  different  time 
steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. 
Subsequent  experiments  included  training  the  model  with  various 
combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These 
raw  and curated versions of the datasets are  readily accessible in the 
Code and Data Availability section. 

2.3. Deep neural network architecture

Machine learning coupled with big data technology has permeated 
agriculture  to  inform  crop,  livestock,  and  water  management  (Liakos 
et  al.,  2018).  For  example,  previous  studies  have  successfully  used 
artificial  intelligence  to  analyze  and  classify  animal  behavior  (Klean-
thous et al., 2022), and evaluate animal well-being (McLennan et al., 
2015).  Furthermore,  the  use  of  neural  networks  or  deep  learning  ar-
chitectures has significantly increased for solving entomological prob-
lems  (Marinho  et  al.,  2023;Peng  and  Wang,  2022;  Tuda  and  Luna- 
Maldonado,  2020).  For  example,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN)  have  been  applied  to  the  classification  of  fruit  fly  pupae  as 
parasitized or healthy (Marinho et al., 2023) and the recognition of in-
sect  pest  species  (Peng  and  Wang,  2022;  Tuda  and  Luna-Maldonado, 
2020).  Regarding  honey  bees,  recent  studies  have  proposed  deep

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided about the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for a binary classification task. This is because the listed performance metrics, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve, are commonly used for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. Additionally, the mention of the Binary Cross Entropy loss function further supports this inference. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is most likely intended for binary classification purposes.
