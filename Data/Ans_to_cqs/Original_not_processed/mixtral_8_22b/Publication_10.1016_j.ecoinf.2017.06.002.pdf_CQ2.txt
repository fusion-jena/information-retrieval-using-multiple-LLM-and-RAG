Several standards and formats currently exist to describe data col-
lection, processing, and reporting for environmental data and promote
interoperability between data repositories. Examples include the Open
Geospatial Consortium “Observation and Measurements” standard for
observations and sampling features (OGC, 2013; ISO 19156:2011,
2011), International Standards Organization/Federal Geographic Data
Committee standards for geospatial (FGDC, 1998, ISO 19115-1:2014)
and temporal metadata (ISO 8601), netCDF formats for climate and
forecast metadata (Unidata, 2016), and the Ecological Metadata

start, middle, or end of the sampling period), 3) data processing level
with related processing approaches (e.g. raw, translated/processed,
data originator QA/QC, project-level QA/QC), 4) references to the
measurement setting description (e.g., E-ﬁeld Log ﬁle)—this informa-
tion is essential because it links the data to additional metadata re-
ported in the separate templates described in Section 3.3 (see
Fig. 2)—, and 5) references to data ﬁle descriptions (Data Column
Description).

data types, the ﬁrst version of FRAMES described here is focused on

approaches because common and transparent processing approaches
facilitate comparability. An additional advantage of this ﬂexible ap-
proach is that data originators and consumers can assimilate data into
variety of databases. A key component of this ﬂexibility is achieved by
separating the data column description from the data ﬁle description so
that the data column description can be customized to the speciﬁc data
ﬁle.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or the data formats used within such a pipeline. However, it discusses several standards and formats for describing data collection, processing, and reporting for environmental data, which could potentially be used in various pipelines, including deep learning ones. These standards and formats include the Open Geospatial Consortium "Observation and Measurements" standard, International Standards Organization/Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for geospatial and temporal metadata, netCDF formats for climate and forecast metadata, and the Ecological Metadata Language. While these do not directly mention specific data formats like images, audio, video, or CSV, they suggest that the data being handled might involve spatial, temporal, and ecological aspects. Therefore, depending on the application, any suitable format representing such data could be employed in a deep learning pipeline.
