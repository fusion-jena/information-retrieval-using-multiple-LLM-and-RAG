positive  correlation  between  radiation  and  GSN,  with  correlation  co-
efficients  of  0.633  and  0.605,  respectively  (Fig.  12d,  and  Fig.  12h). 
Conversely, in the PE and SE basin, the relationship between radiation 
and GSN is negative, with correlation coefficients of (cid:0) 0.144 and (cid:0) 0.157 
respectively  (Fig.  12f  and  Fig.  12g).  Radiation,  the  primary  energy 
source  for  photosynthesis,  directly  influences  vegetation  productivity 
and distribution. Under conditions of ample hydration, augmented solar 
radiation  typically  enhances  photosynthesis  and  growth  in  plants 
(Pierce et al., 2005). However, when irradiance levels are excessively 
high and coincident with inadequate  moisture availability, plants un-
dergo significant hydric stress, which detrimentally affects their growth 
rate and biomass accumulation (Walton et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2017). 
Research by Sun et al. (2018) reveals that in cool temperate moist zones,

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository. It is stated that the data will be made available upon request, but there is no direct link provided.
