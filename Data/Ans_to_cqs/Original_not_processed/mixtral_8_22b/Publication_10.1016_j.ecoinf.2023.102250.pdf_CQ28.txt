number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

Note: The full name of the abbreviation “BN” is Batch Normalization. The three parameters of “Conv2d(3,1,1)” represent the size of the convolution kernel, the stride 
size, and the padding, respectively.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed using AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
