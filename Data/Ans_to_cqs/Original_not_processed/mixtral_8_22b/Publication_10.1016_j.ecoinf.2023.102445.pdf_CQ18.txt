4. Discussion 

Real-time  detection  and  counting  of  pests  in  a  specific  area  are 
important  for  timely  pest  spotting  and  control.  This  work  helps  to 
quickly determine the distribution and quantity of pests in the current 
environment, not only by providing critical data for agricultural man-
agement but also by helping to optimize the use of pesticides, thereby 
preventing  unnecessary  pesticide  waste  and  environmental  pollution 
(Dhankhar and Kumar, 2023; Liu et al., 2021).

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves conducting a series of ablation experiments using different network models. Specifically, ten ablation experiments were carried out, each utilizing a unique network model. The first experiment used the original YOLOv8 model, while the subsequent nine experiments employed models with varying structures based on YOLOv8.

To ensure consistency in evaluating these models, several parameters were standardized across all experiments. For instance, a batch size of 16 was chosen, and the input image resolution was fixed at 640 x 640 pixels. Furthermore, the total number of epochs was set to 150, and the learning rate was maintained at 0.01 throughout the training process. The optimization algorithm used was Adam, and two additional parameters - depth_scale and width_scale - were assigned values of 0.33 and 0.25 respectively.

However, the exact methodology used to track and compare the performance of these models during training remains unclear without further details. Typically, such strategies might involve monitoring metrics like loss or accuracy over time, visualizing model predictions, or analyzing confusion matrices. Given the available information, we can infer that the researchers likely utilized similar techniques to assess their models' progress during training. However, the precise approach adopted here cannot be definitively determined based solely on the provided context.
