hyperparameters.  The  hyperparameters  with  the  current  results  are 
saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the 
proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. 
After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides 
us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN. 
The  overall  complexity  is  dominated  by  the  iterations,  “TC”,  and 
within  each  iteration,  the  operations  depend  on  the  population  size

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen or validation data. Regularization helps improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This method forces the network to distribute the learned information across all neurons rather than relying heavily on specific ones. By doing so, it reduces the gap between training and validation results and improves the model's generalizability.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit. In other words, L2 regularization discourages large weights, promoting a more balanced distribution of weights among the features.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the provided context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, like L2, adds a penalty term but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of their square. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing images, helping the model become more robust and less prone to overfitting.
