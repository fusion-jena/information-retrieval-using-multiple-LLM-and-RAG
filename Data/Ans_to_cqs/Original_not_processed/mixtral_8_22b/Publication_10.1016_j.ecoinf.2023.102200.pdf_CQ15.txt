3.3. Effect of LiDAR point density on the CHM quality

Individual  mangrove  trees,  low  shrubs,  and  other  classes  were 
labelled  manually  on  the  BEV  images,  and  the  BEV  images  with 
bounding  box  labels  were  used  to  train  the  Faster  R-CNN  detector. 
During the detector operation, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet- 
101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (with momentum), with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 
0.9,  and  a  batch  size  of  1.  The  network  was  initialised  with  weights 
developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do state that they use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification tasks. CNNs typically involve backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms for optimizing the model parameters during training.

In the work by Marasigan et al. (2019), no explicit information is given about the optimization techniques employed in their machine learning approach. They focus on developing a methodology for measuring mangrove crown diameters using airborne LiDAR data and the marker-controlled watershed algorithm.

On the other hand, Martins et al. (2021) provide more details regarding the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. They employ the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm for segmentation tasks. During the training process, they utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum for optimizing the model parameters. Specifically, they set the learning rate to 0.003, the momentum to 0.9, and a batch size of 1. Additionally, they initialize the network with pretrained weights developed from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset.

Therefore, based on the available context, it can be concluded that one of the papers employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum as an optimization technique in its deep learning pipeline.
