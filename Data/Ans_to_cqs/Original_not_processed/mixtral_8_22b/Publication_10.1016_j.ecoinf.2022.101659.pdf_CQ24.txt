Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’.

condition, pointing again to the potential role of food availability and 
quality in triggering valve opening when food is available, as already 
seen for other species (e.g. A. islandica, Ballesta-Artero et al., 2017) and 
narrowing  to  avoid  high  metabolic  costs  when  food  is  low  (Riisgård 
et al., 2011; Tang and Riisgård, 2016). Parallel experimentation showed 
higher  levels  of  biodeposit  production  and  lower  grow  rate  at  S1 
(Capelle, pers. comm.).

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on this topic.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often comes from various sources, including weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, and others. To handle this randomness, several strategies are commonly used:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures reproducibility across different runs or machines.

2. Multiple Runs: Another strategy is to run the model multiple times with different initializations and aggregate the results. This helps reduce the impact of individual random seeds and provides a better estimate of the overall performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques, such as K-fold cross-validation, can help mitigate the effects of randomness by training and testing the model on different subsets of the dataset.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds into an ensemble can also help reduce the variance caused by randomness.

5. Bayesian Optimization: Instead of using a single random seed, one could use Bayesian optimization methods to search over a range of possible hyperparameters, including random seeds, to find the best combination.
