The method requires manually setting several parameters, described 
in more details in the user guide.7 In particular, about half a dozen pa-
rameters allow to set thresholds on the size of the support of the output 
redescriptions and to control the length and complexity of their queries. 
We required that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (Min-
SuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries 
(MinSuppOut). In other words, the intersection of the supports of the 
two  queries  (the  support  of  the  redescription)  and  their  union  were 
required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is 
an inclusive choice, not overly restrictive, that aims at capturing local 
patterns. Increasing the upper threshold further would jeopardize the 
local aspect of the analysis, and would lead to something more akin to 
non-linear regression. For a redescription to be informative, its support

Redescription mining, on which we focus here, combines partition-
ing  techniques, such as  clustering, and  modelling techniques, such as 
regression.  It  identifies  multiple  local  models  on  subsets  of  data,  and 
automatically  generates  sets  of  limiting  conditions  and  the  corre-
sponding split of the data. This is where redescription mining departs 
from most classical analysis methods that identify global models and do 
not yield explicit and interpretable limiting conditions.

to three dental variables and two climate variables. In the second run, 
we allowed dental queries to involve disjunctions, and climate queries to 
contain up to three variables, but tightened the requirement of accuracy 
gain.  Specifically,  under  this  constraint,  a  candidate  query  can  be 
extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, 
as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by a least 0.1. The goal 
is to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries. This can be 
achieved either explicitly, by limiting the number of variables and the 
operators  used  in  the  queries,  as  in  the  first  run,  or  implicitly,  by 
allowing increased complexity only if it brings substantial improvement 
in terms of accuracy, as in the second run. 

4.3. Selecting individual redescriptions for further analyses

As a practical example, consider the following query over climatic 

variables: 

qC = [19.6 ≤ T + WarmM ≤ ] AND [116 ≤ PWarmQ].

We use the Iverson bracket to specify satisfiability conditions, that is, 
in our case, the ranges in which the numerical variables must take value. 
The query above selects localities where the maximum temperature of 
the warmest month (T
C and the 
precipitation of the warmest quarter (PWarmQ) is greater than 116 mm. 
The support of this query, denoted as supp(qC), is the set of localities 
where  the  specified  temperature  and  precipitation  conditions  are 
satisfied. 

WarmM) is between 19.6 and 38.5

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, some insights can still be derived from the text.

The process discussed in the context involves redescription mining, which combines partitioning techniques like clustering with modeling techniques like regression. Redescription mining focuses on identifying multiple local models within subsets of data and generating sets of limiting conditions along with corresponding splits of the data.

This approach differs from traditional analysis methods that aim to find global models without providing explicit and interpretable limiting conditions. Therefore, one could infer that the splitting of data might depend on these generated limiting conditions and the resulting local patterns found through redescription mining.

Additionally, the context mentions certain constraints applied during the runs, such as requiring at least 1% of localities satisfying both queries and at least 30% of localities satisfying neither of the queries. These constraints may also play a role in determining how the data gets divided into different subsets for training purposes.

However, since no clear mention of specific criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets was made, it cannot be definitively stated what those exact criteria are based solely on the provided context.
