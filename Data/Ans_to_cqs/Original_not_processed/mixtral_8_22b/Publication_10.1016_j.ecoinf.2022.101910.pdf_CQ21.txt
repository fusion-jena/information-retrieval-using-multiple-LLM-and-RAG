identify which of the candidate sounds are vocalizations of the desired

et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

0.76 to 0.78 for BirdNET and Kaleidoscope Pro, respectively (Table 2), 
which means that both automated software were able to automatically 
detect  over  three  quarters  of  the  vocalizations  detected  by  a  human 
observer.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned to classify or predict the given data.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial evaluation, hyperparameters of the model may need to be fine-tuned to improve its performance further. This could involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, number of layers, activation functions, regularization terms, etc.

3. Visualizing Results: Visual representations of results can provide insights into the model's behavior and decision-making processes. Techniques like saliency maps, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), t-SNE plots, etc., can be used to visualize feature importance, attention areas, clustering patterns, etc.

4. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, broken down by each class. This helps in identifying any biases or imbalances in the model's predictions.

5. Error Analysis: Analyzing errors made by the model can reveal underlying issues with the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architecture, etc. Identifying sources of error can guide improvements in subsequent iterations of the model.

These postprocessing steps aim to ensure that the trained model meets the desired level of performance and reliability before being deployed for practical use.
