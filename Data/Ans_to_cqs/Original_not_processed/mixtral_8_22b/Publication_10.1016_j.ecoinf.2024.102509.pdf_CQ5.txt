predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

2.2. Mapping of LULC 

An imagery acquired from the Pleiades-1B satellite on January 28, 
2020 and provided by Airbus Defence and Space was used in this study. 
It is an ortho-rectified, multi-spectral dataset consisting of four spectral 
bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) having a fine spatial reso-
lution of 2 m and one panchromatic band (480–820 nm) having 0.50 m 
resolution.  This  procured  imagery  was  classified  using  the  Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to obtain different hyperplanes on a 
multi-axial graph that can separate the data points into various classes 
with high precision (Datta et al., 2022; Foody and Mathur, 2004). Spe-
cifically, eight LULC categories were recognized here within the WIZ, 
viz.  open  mangrove,  Casuarina  plantation,  mixed  vegetation,  herba-
ceous vegetation, bare earth and sand, built-up, waterbody and aqua-
culture.  Field  observations  coupled  with  the  Standard  False  Colour

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover classification. However, it mentions the use of an imagery dataset acquired from the Pleiades-1B satellite, which consists of four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) with a fine spatial resolution of 2 meters and one panchromatic band (480–820 nm) with a resolution of 0.50 meters. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was then applied to classify this imagery dataset into eight Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) categories. Additionally, the text references the World Agroforestry Centre databases, but it does not specify whether these databases were utilized in the deep learning pipeline or for what purpose they were used.
