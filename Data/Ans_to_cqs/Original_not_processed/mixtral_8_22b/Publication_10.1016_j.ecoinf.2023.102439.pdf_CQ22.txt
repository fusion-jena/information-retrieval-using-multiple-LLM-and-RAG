2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

The model’s training was conducted using data from 2005 to 2015, 
encompassing 264 data points. Subsequently, data from 2016 to 2018, 
comprising  72  data  points,  were  reserved  for  testing  and  validation 
purposes.  This  data  partitioning  resulted  in  a  distribution  of  60%  for 
training and 40% for validation and testing. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, several statistical metrics 
were  employed,  including  the  Mean  Absolute  Percent  Error  (MAPE), 
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and cor-
relation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy 
and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation be-
tween the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

The test value R in artificial neural networks evaluates the model’s 
overall performance. A high R-value indicates that the model can make 
predictions close to the actual data and exhibits good performance. The 
model performance, dependent on the number of selected hidden layer 
neurons,  is  presented in  Table  3.  In this  context, an  R-value between 
70% and 80% signifies that the model can make predictions close to the 
actual  data  and  demonstrates  a  successful  performance  (Sa˘gık  et  al., 
2021). When 6 hidden layer neurons were selected for both stations, the 
NARX model yielded the best results. The table also includes the rela-
tionship between the target values of training, validation, and test re-
sults. The training values were 82% for Iznik and 84% for Alanya. The 
estimated percentages of all the datasets were obtained through training 
with the ANN as 80% for Iznik and 82% for Alanya. It has been deter-

Helpful Answer:
In order to assess the performance of the deep learning model, several statistical metrics have been utilized. These include the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics offer valuable insights into the accuracy and predictive capacity of the model by quantifying the discrepancy between the anticipated EVI values and the actual observed ones. By applying the W-ANN model, the training values achieved 96% for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the projected percentages for all data escalated to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The development of a hybrid model led to an improvement in learning proficiency, resulting in a rise of 18.7% in Iznik and 7.3% in Alanya, as established by the network's performance. These discoveries underscore the heightened predictive abilities and efficacy of the hybrid model in both research regions.
