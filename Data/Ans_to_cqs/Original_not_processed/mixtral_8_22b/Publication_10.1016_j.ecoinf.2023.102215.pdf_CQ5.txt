networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

and can yield desirable saliency identification results on public datasets. 
Recent deep SOD models based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) 
(Long et al., 2015) are committed to extracting and fusing multi-scale 
features, aiming to produce comprehensive representations of various 
objects to generate the final saliency predictions. For instance, Liu et al. 
(2019b)  (PoolNet)  incorporated  a  pyramid  pooling  module  into  the 
feature pyramid network (FPN) (Lin et al., 2017) architecture to pass 
high-level semantic information, which is aggregated into feature maps 
at different levels. Zhao et al. (2020) (GateNet) proposed the FPN-based 
gate  mechanism  to  cooperatively  fuse  multi-level  features,  enhancing 
the overall discernment capability of the network.

TrunkNet’s  feature  extraction  includes  11  well-configured  MIF
blocks,  which  are  connected  in  an  encoder-decoder  framework  of  U- 
structure.  The  MIF block  is  also  an  encoder-decoder  network  and  in 
particular,  embedded  with  an  attention  mechanism  (the  TA module) 
such that it can well capture multiscale features. The MIF block and the 
TA module will be articulated in later sections. Six MIF blocks, marked 
with EN-i for 1⩽i⩽6 are encoders, while the others, marked with DN-j for 
1⩽j⩽5 are decoders. Encoder EN-6 and all five decoders output a feature 
map each; these output maps form a set of multiscale features, which are 
passed into the feature aggregation part for further processing.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several types of datasets used in their experiments:

1. Static images and living videos of a commercial orchard
2. RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
3. RGB-images of a single tree branch
4. RGB-images of urban streets
5. Synthetic images and natural images of forests
6. RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
7. RGB-images of complex urban scenes

These datasets seem to be specific to the research topic, focusing on applications related to agriculture and urban environments.
