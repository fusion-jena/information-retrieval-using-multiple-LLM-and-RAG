Long-term land use P and N loss models often employ land use maps, 
soil maps, and other generic spatial datasets as inputs. The results of this 
work demonstrated that, in the extremely vulnerable NWH ecosystem, 
changes in land use impacted the spatial distribution of TSN and TSP. 
Thus,  the  quantification  of  these  changes  would  contribute  to  the 
regional  scale  P  and  N  transfer  models.  This  procedure  includes  an 
evaluation of soil and ecological variables related with such changes, 
which are preferably quantified from current databases as described in 
Fig. 3 that has been obtained by a kriging method using data collected 
from  the  field.  The  accuracy  of  any  spatial  prediction  is  critical  as  it 
determines  the  quality  of  the  interpolated  values.  In  this  work  the 
diagnostic measures of quality of spatial prediction were evaluated by
