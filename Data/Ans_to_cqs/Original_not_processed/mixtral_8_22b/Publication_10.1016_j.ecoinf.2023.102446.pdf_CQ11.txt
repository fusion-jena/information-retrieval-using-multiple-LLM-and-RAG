Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

information about carbon sources and sinks (Oikawa et al., 2017).

Fig. 5. The first column implies the number of links generated by the source variables, and the second column denotes the number of links received by target 
variables from all the sources. The X-axis shows 104 weeks, and the Y-axis refers to the number of connections. The pink and green colour denotes the time series of a 
number of links generated for mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE), whereas the maroon and purple colors indicate the number of links received by 
target variables in the form of MI and TE. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact data repository link based on the available information. However, it can be suggested to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more specific details regarding the data repository link.
