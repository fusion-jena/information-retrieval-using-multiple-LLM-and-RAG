%Query
Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not directly address the specific methodologies used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, they provide some insights into the types of data sources used in various research fields. For instance, Li and Li (2015) discuss the use of nighttime light remote sensing data, which could be collected through satellite or airborne sensors. Similarly, Li et al. (2013) utilize nighttime light imagery, suggesting the use of image-based data collection methods. In contrast, Li et al. (2009) study Hypanthia cunea (Drury), implying the potential use of field survey data or biological databases. Lastly, Li et al. (2019) employ Luojia No.1 nightlight data, indicating the utilization of publicly available datasets. Therefore, while these papers do not explicitly detail the data collection process, they suggest the use of sensor-based data acquisition, such as satellite or airborne sensors, image-based data collection, field surveys, and publicly accessible datasets.
