temporal  variations  in  the  Three  Gorges  Reservoir  area  provides  a 
nuanced  understanding  of  ecosystem  responses  to  LULC  changes. 
Despite these advancements, the absence of annual LULC data remains a 
challenge. Souza's innovative approach (Souza et al., 2020), through the 
MapBiomas network, leverages the random forest algorithm and Google 
Earth Engine on the Landsat archive to reconstruct annual LULC infor-
mation for Brazil, showcasing a methodological leap in large-scale LULC 
analysis. Similarly, Potapov's project (Potapov et al., 2022) on annual, 
multidecadal  land  monitoring  marks  a  significant  stride  towards 
tracking global sustainable development, revealing pivotal shifts in land 
cover and use over recent decades. This collective body of work high-
lights the integral role of LULC maps in environmental science, offering 
insights into the ongoing transformations across various landscapes. The

A  key  distinguishing  feature  of  the  presented  methodology  is  the 
integration  of  multitemporal,  high-resolution  satellite  imagery  with 
advanced  neural  network  models.  This  approach  allows  for  a  more 
nuanced analysis of the temporal dynamics of LULC changes, enabling 
the  detection  of  subtle  shifts  that  may  be  overlooked  by  traditional 
methods. Additionally, the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically 
designed to handle the complexity and variability of ecological data, sets 
this study apart from previous research in the field. The findings of this 
study have far-reaching implications for sustainable land management 
and  ecological  conservation  strategies  on  the  Kerch  Peninsula.  By 
providing  a  detailed  and  accurate  assessment  of  LULC  changes,  this 
research contributes to a better understanding of the ecological impact 
of human activities in this region. Furthermore, the methodology can be
