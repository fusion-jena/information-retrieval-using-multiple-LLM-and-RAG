2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best
