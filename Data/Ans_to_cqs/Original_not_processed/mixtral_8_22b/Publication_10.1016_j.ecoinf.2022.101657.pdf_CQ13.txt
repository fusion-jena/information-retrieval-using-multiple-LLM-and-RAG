7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights.

7.1.4. Low power neural networks in hardware 

It is desirable to reduce the power consumption of the DynAIkonTrap 
to make deployment in remote locations easier and less expensive. An 
implementation by Si et al. (2020) of a Multilayer Perceptron model on 
an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) was shown to run in a similar 
time frame to a software-based approach, but at a clock speed lower by a 
factor of 144. The authors portray this as the ability to achieve a lower 
power consumption or improve performance by a factor of 144. Results 
published by Intel (2016) indicate a Convolutional Neural Network can 
be  run  on  an  FPGA  with  twice  the  efficiency  of  a  software/CPU 
implementation.

Recently,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  has  been  brought  to  some 
commercial camera traps, such as the Trail-Guard by Resolve, although 
literature around effectiveness for this is lacking. The use of AI “at the 
edge” may be able to overcome some of the issues of traditional camera 
traps, such as a large number of empty images being kept for analysis 
and  later  discarded.  More  specifically,  machine  learning,  especially 
based  on deep  learning techniques, is  being explored by  the research 
community to reduce as much as possible the amount of useless data 
being  collected.  For  example,  Schindler  and  Steinhage  (2021)  use  a 
combination  of  Mask  R-CNN  with  Flow-Guided  Feature  Aggregation 
(Zhu et al., 2017) to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in 
video clips. Their study is applied to data obtained by camera traps with 
PIR,  capturing  at  dusk  and  night,  in  Bavaria,  four  classes  of  animals

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that further research is required to develop a process that generates a robust and reliable neural network model tailored to a specific set of species. This suggests that the optimal hyperparameters might depend on the particular application and dataset. Additionally, the text discusses efforts to reduce power consumption using low-power neural networks implemented in hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It also highlights recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to commercial camera traps, including the use of deep learning techniques to minimize the collection of unnecessary data.
