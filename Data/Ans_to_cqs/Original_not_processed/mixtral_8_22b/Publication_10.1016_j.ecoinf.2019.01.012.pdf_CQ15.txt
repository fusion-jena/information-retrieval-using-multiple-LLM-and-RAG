Although the use of pre-trained models has proven to be advanta-
geous for many image recognition tasks (Weiss et al., 2016), we decided
to train the model from scratch. We recognized that our speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation problem was too diﬀerent from the pre-trained networks.
Moreover, we considered the number of labeled samples available
(nearly 30,000 per class) as large enough for training our own network.

We trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers
and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected
layer (Clevert et al., 2015). As optimizer we chose the adaptive ADAM
(Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
Training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations
(= 90 epochs).

layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers (Voulodimos et al.,
2018). The ﬁrst two components are responsible for automatic feature
extraction by applying a large number of diﬀerent ﬁlters on the input
data. This process of feature extraction is performed on multiple levels,
whereby the output of each level is the input to the following. From
level to level, the extracted features increase in complexity - from rather
simple features (e.g. edges) on the lowest level to more complex fea-
tures on the highest level (Gu et al., 2018). By passing large quantities
of labeled training data through the network, the model successively
learns to recognize the relevant features, which are necessary to dis-
tinguish between classes.

Machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has evolved into
the most commonly used approaches for the automatic classiﬁcation of
digital images (LeCun et al., 2015). The major advantage of deep
learning is that the time-consuming and complex step of previous fea-
ture extraction becomes unnecessary. Instead, the model learns and
extracts the relevant features itself during the training process. The
major drawback of deep learning is that large amounts of labeled
training data are required (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to
extract spatial features. CNNs have proven to be quite powerful in
performing diﬀerent tasks such as object detection (Everingham et al.,
2010; Tompson et al., 2014), classiﬁcation (Traore et al., 2018, Xu
et al., 2017, Amara et al., 2017, Lu et al., 2017, Han et al., 2018) and

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained using the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. ADAM is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning pipelines, known for its efficiency and low memory requirements. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum, resulting in an optimization technique that can converge quickly while being computationally efficient. Other optimization techniques mentioned in the references include SGD without momentum and RMSprop, but these were not explicitly stated as being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
