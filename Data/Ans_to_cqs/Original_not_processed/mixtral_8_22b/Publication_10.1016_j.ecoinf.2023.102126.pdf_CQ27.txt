2.2. Downloading the records 

The  following  variables  were  imported  for  each  record:1)  type  of 
content (dataset, data study, software, or repository), 2) data source (the 
source  from  which  the  data  were  obtained),  and  3)  Web  of  Science 
category of the data source (i.e. multidisciplinary agriculture, ecology, 
biodiversity conservation, and environmental sciences). 

The bibliographic information collected using the DCI for each re-
cord  includes  authors/creators,  year  of  publication  (the  collected  re-
cords  were  published  from  1900  to  the  present),  title  of  the  dataset, 
publisher (understood as the repository in which the data are deposited 
or the organisation responsible for making the data available), version, 
and permanent identifier (e.g. a unique URL, databank accession num-
ber, or another permanent identifier such as Handle (hdl) (http://www. 
handle.net/)).

Fig. 1 shows an extract from a JSON file that includes the identifier 
number, metric name with results (output), evaluation score, debugging 
messages, and a  summary of  all metrics in  the evaluation. Finally, to 
visualize the scores after compiling all the PIDs, we created a report by 
running a computational notebook (. ipynb document) provided by the 
FAIRsFAIR team (Devaraju and Huber, 2021a). This notebook provides 
an overall analysis and visualisation of all PID responses assessed using 
the F-UJI. 

In summary, a) the report reads JSON’s responses, b) collects all the 
total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame, and c) visualises the 
metrics  and  summarises  the  evaluations  (in  our  case,  the  datasets 
associated with each repository). The characteristics of the report are 
discussed in the Section 3. 

For further analysis, two aspects of the findings of this study were 

considered.

To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.
