inaccurate localisation (White et al., 2006; Wiggins et al., 2013). The 
accuracy  of  sound  speed  profiles  is  important  for  localising  sound 
sources, with the speed of sound transmission underlying the accuracy

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the table and text that the dataset includes acoustic data, specifically vocalizations of different song structures. This suggests that the data format used could be audio files. Additionally, there is mention of sound speed profiles which further supports this inference. It should also be noted that the table presents percentages of detections and classifications, indicating that some form of processing has been applied to the raw data. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state what data formats are being used.
