retrieved  local  climate  data,  envisions  potential  avenues  to  exploit 
existing  remote  sensing  data  and  web-based  APIs.  For  instance,  the 
utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US 
soil moisture data can be beneficial. This could lead to the development 
of integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at 
varying degrees of granularity. Not only would this augment the inter-
operability of our system, but it would also foster enhanced multidis-
ciplinary  communication  at  the  developmental  stage,  consequently 
bolstering  collaborations  across  fields.  Nevertheless,  the  prospect  of 
identifying a unified data framework with global applicability remains 
uncertain to us.

specific projects often require detailed soil information from a particular 
site,  delving  below  the  soil  surface  and  taking  into  account  varying 
depths. Technicians typically gather this information through soil sur-
veys and present it as raw data to professionals. However, this format 
can  create  challenges  in  effectively  communicating  and  collaborating 
across  disciplines.  Various  research  efforts  have  made  strides  in 
addressing these concerns: Yang et al. (2022) developed a framework for 
the  preliminary  delineation  of  soil  profile  horizons;  Alqadad  et  al. 
(2017)  documented  several  accidents that occurred  during urban  soil 
investigation  due  to  outdated  soil  profile  information;  Temme  and 
Vanwalleghem (2016) introduced a new model linking landscape and 
soil profile evolution based on sensitivity analysis; Pourabdollah et al. 
(2012)  proposed  a  data  exchange  schema  for  soil  and  terrain  data;

created using web-based technology for monitoring purposes and can be 
accessed  within  an  internet  browser  (Cope  et  al.,  2017;  Jarray  et  al., 
2022; Deval et al., 2022). These studies often involve a backend online 
system that continuously collects and processes data before visualizing it 
on the frontend. Additionally, the utilization of software architectures 
that amalgamate multiple web-based technologies facilitates the crea-
tion  of  integrated  pipelines  for  data  processing  and  mapping  (Zhang 
et  al.,  2022). This  format enables users with  minimal technical  back-
ground  to  quickly  obtain  the  information  they  seek.  Additionally, 
research  catering  to  specific  needs  employs  customized  visualization 
techniques, such as game engines (Cicekci et al., 2014), 3D modeling 
software (Filippucci et al., 2016), and more.

In the realm of visualization, the chosen approach often depends on 
the target audience and the format of the source data. Given the limited 
literature on soil visualization outside of soil mapping, we conducted a 
broader  survey  of  this  topic  within  the  general  environmental  and 
ecological context. A significant portion of such research falls into the 
data  visualization  category,  which  utilizes  data  obtained  from  various 
survey  methods  to  reveal  targeted  information.  Techniques  such  as 
reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization are 
employed to transform data into a format that highlights the intended 
information.  The  results  of  these  studies  are  often  code  libraries  in 
conventional data science programming languages (Python or R), which 
users can utilize and build upon (Araya et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2022; 
Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2022). Another type of visualization is typically

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that technicians gather detailed soil information from a particular site by conducting soil surveys. This suggests that one method for collecting raw data might be through soil surveys. Furthermore, the mention of utilizing existing remote sensing data and web-based APIs implies that other sources of raw data collection may include satellite imagery, drone footage, or publicly available datasets. Lastly, the reference to Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US soil moisture data indicates that public datasets could also serve as a valuable resource for gathering raw data.
