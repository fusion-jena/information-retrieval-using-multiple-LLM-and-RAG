Training a CNN for acoustic detection is also becomingly increasingly

Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model 
(Nolan  et  al., 2022)  trained on covey call  spectrogram data collected 
separately to this study from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and 
Alabama,  USA.  Our  covey  call  acoustic  CNN  is  trained  to  detect  and 
localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note 
their associated time and peak power (dB). We chose to use a relatively 
conservative  score  threshold  echoing  that  of  other  similar  studies 
ˇ
Sirovi´c, 2021; Ruff et al., 2020), where only calls that 
(Rasmussen and 
received a score of 0.95 or higher were officially classified as a positive 
bobwhite detection. All CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a 
random sample of five one-hour files from each year were then manually 
reviewed to evaluate model accuracy and to calculate a false positive 
rate “i.e. how many calls were incorrectly labelled as bobwhite”. Across

Nevertheless, an important consideration of the use of ARUs, which 
may limit their use in certain situations for density estimation, is how to 
effectively process the acoustic data collected (Gibb et al., 2019). Our 
custom  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  for  covey  call  detection 
proved  here  to  be  an  extremely  useful  tool  for  quick  processing  of 
acoustic data: a one hour .wav file can be processed for detections in 
approximately eight seconds (Nolan et al., 2022). However, the appli-
cation of ARUs to the surveys of other species may be limited by the 
available machine learning methods to process large quantities of data 
as efficiently. Nevertheless, CNNs in ecology are becoming increasingly 
more common, and models for the detection of many species, especially 
avian  species  (for  example  BirdNET  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021)  or  BirdCLEF 
models (Kahl et al., 2020)) are freely available for download. Models can

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for acoustic detection. However, it is generally understood that when working with audio data, some common preprocessing techniques include noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction such as creating spectrograms or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). These techniques help prepare the raw audio data into a format suitable for inputting into a deep learning model like a CNN. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps might have been performed but were not mentioned in the given context.
