targeted fish species dataset. This dataset was then divided into training 
and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process.

following results:  

3.2. LigObNet detection performance 

1)  The integration of the parameter-free attention mechanism SimAM 
yielded improved detection accuracy while maintaining the detec-
tion speed and model complexity on par with those of the E3 model, 
demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing the overall performance of 
fish detection in our proposed model.  

2)  The computational load remains constant when integrating the SE, 
CBAM, and CA attention mechanisms; however, the model endowed 
with SE attention achieves higher speeds owing to a reduced number 
of network layers.  

3)  Employing attention mechanisms may decrease the detection speed 
by  1.2–12.3%  relative  to  the  baseline  E3  model,  which  does  not 
incorporate such mechanisms. Nevertheless, this study contends that 
the integration of attention mechanisms is advantageous because it 
allows  the  extraction  of  more  detailed  information  on  targets, 
thereby enhancing detection accuracy.
