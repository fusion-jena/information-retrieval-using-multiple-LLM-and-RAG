2.6.1. Random search 

Random Search (RS) is an optimization method widely used in ML 
and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It is a simple and effective 
optimization  approach  that  is  often  used  as  a  baseline  for  comparing 
other optimization methods. A set of hyperparameters is selected and 
evaluated randomly to find the set with the best accuracy for a random 
search optimization. This method suits ill-structured global optimization 
problems  where  the  objective  function  may  be  non-convex  and  non- 
differentiable  (Zabinsky,  2009).  RS  can  outperform  grid  search  and 
compete  with  Bayesian  optimization  for  a  classification  problem  on

This  study  adopted  an  automated  optimization  architecture  by 
comparing three architecture optimization algorithms: Random Search 
(RS), Hyperband, and Bayesian optimization. Hyperparameters of our 
DNN model were automatically optimized according to a search grid of 
several hyperparameters listed in Table 1. A dropout layer was added to 
prevent overfitting and to reduce statistical noise. The dropout regula-
rization  randomly  removed  different  sets  of  neurons  using  a  pre-
determined  dropout  rate,  which  resulted  in  training  different  neural 
networks and reduced overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of Random Search (RS) as an optimization method in Machine Learning and AI applications. RS is a simple yet effective optimization technique that selects and evaluates a set of hyperparameters randomly to find the configuration with the best performance.

In this context, one strategy to manage randomness could involve setting a fixed random seed before running the Random Search algorithm. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across multiple runs or experiments. Additionally, fixing the random seed allows other researchers to reproduce results accurately.

Moreover, the Dropout layer mentioned in the text serves as another strategy to address randomness in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly removes different sets of neurons during each iteration of training, effectively creating various neural networks. Consequently, Dropout reduces overfitting and improves generalization by minimizing co-adaptations between neurons.

To summarize, while the given context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer two potential strategies based on the information provided: setting a fixed random seed for reproducibility and employing Dropout as a regularization technique to mitigate the effects of randomness during training.
