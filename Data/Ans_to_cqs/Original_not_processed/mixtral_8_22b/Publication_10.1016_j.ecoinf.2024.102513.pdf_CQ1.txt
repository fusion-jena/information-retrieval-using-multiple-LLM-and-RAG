approach provided a comprehensive understanding of LULC dynamics 
and enhanced the validation process for satellite imagery data.

While this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of land 
cover change in the Kerch Peninsula, several avenues for future research 
offer opportunities to enhance the technical aspects of historical land use 
and  land  cover  mapping.  Particularly,  addressing  the  challenge  of 
limited data availability for training deep neural networks in cases of 
sparse historical information warrants further investigation.

Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the utilization of remote sensing Earth observation data and satellite imagery data for conducting Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis using a deep neural network. These types of data can be collected using various methods, including satellites equipped with sensors capable of capturing multispectral or hyperspectral images, airborne platforms like drones or aircraft fitted with cameras, and ground-based sensors. Additionally, publicly available datasets containing relevant satellite imagery or other Earth observation data could also be employed. Therefore, while the exact methodology is not specified, we can infer that some combination of these techniques may have been applied to gather the necessary data for training the deep learning models.
