A key point in machine learning is represented by the data, not only 
by the algorithms. The structure of the training data can have profound 
and critical effects on the outcomes of models trained with the RF al-
gorithm. While this is an important point which is worthy of evaluation, 
our dataset was limited to a collection of camera trap data on several 
species which makes it difficult to comprehensively compare the effects 
of the data and its structure. We note that this is better explored with 
simulation, as in a recent paper from our group (Kumar et al., 2021) 
which  indeed  showed  that  the  spatial  pattern  and  shape  of  the  envi-
ronmental manifold itself affects performance of GLM and RF. 

5. Conclusions

Independently for each felid, we investigated the most representative 
scale for each covariate by performing univariate Random Forest (RF), 
using  the  full  camera  traps  dataset  and  the  presence-absence  data  as 
response  variable.  For  each  covariate,  we  selected  the  scale  whose 

univariate RF showed the lowest Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error. 

2.4.1. Random forest â€“ model training 

Similar to the GLM approaches, for RF we used two different training 
data selection frameworks. For the first one (hereafter non-bootstrapped 
RF), we trained the RF by using the same training dataset used for the 
non-bootstrapped GLM, composed of randomly selected 80% of camera 
trap locations, and produced species distribution probability surfaces for 
each felid.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it appears that the study uses camera trap data, which typically consists of images or videos captured automatically when motion is detected. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this case would likely be either image or video files. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which suggests that the data may also include structured data such as CSV files containing features extracted from the camera trap data.
