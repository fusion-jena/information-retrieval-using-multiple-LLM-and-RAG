Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) improves the perfor-
mances of ML algorithms by finding the optimal hyperparameter set of
each ML model. The TPE estimates the probability distribution of the
hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructs a
tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function.
This probabilistic model then selects new hyperparameters for the
subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. The TPE is designed for efficient
searching in high-dimensional spaces.

In the present study, the TPE algorithm identified the most effective

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that data will be made available upon request. Therefore, if more information about the specific location or platform of the data repository is needed, one could potentially reach out to the authors or maintainers of the research for further details.
