classification.

These  two  examples  of  small  sample  sizes  highlight  a  conflict  in 
preferred protocol. Ideally, (1) all species would be included in a clas-
sification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity, (2) 
all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to 
better represent the variability found in the area, and (3) only confident 
‘ground truth’ classifications would be considered in the training model. 
Unfortunately, in species where identity must be determined based on 
call characteristics (rather than visual confirmation of species identity in 
the field), it can sometimes be difficult to confidently determine species 
identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one 
call  that  provides  high  confidence  of  species  identity.  In  the  case  of 
beaked whales, we recommend that training data include a high level of 
confidence for inclusion. This is especially critical for species with small

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be suggested based on common practices in the field.

One strategy is to use fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure that their results remain consistent across different runs of the same experiment or model. This approach is particularly useful during development and debugging stages, allowing developers to isolate issues more easily.

Another strategy involves using multiple random seeds to evaluate the robustness of models. By running experiments with various seed values, researchers can assess whether their models perform consistently well under different initial conditions. This method helps identify potential overfitting or sensitivity to specific random states.

Data augmentation techniques can also help manage randomness by artificially increasing dataset size and introducing variations into input data. These methods involve applying transformations like rotations, translations, scaling, and flipping to existing samples, creating new instances that retain essential features while adding diversity. As mentioned in the source "A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning" [1], these techniques have been shown to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

Lastly, ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds or architectures. Ensembling can mitigate the impact of individual model variance due to random initialization, leading to more stable and accurate overall predictions.

In summary, strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline include fixing seed values for reproducibility, evaluating models with multiple seeds, employing data augmentation techniques, and utilizing ensemble methods. While none of the provided sources explicitly discuss these strategies, they reflect common practices used within the broader deep learning community.
