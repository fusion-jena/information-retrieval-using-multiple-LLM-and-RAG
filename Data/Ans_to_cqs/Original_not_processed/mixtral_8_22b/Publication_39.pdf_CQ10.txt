Feichtenhofer et al. (2019). This parameter combination achieved the 
best  results  in  our  experiments.  The  Slow  and  Fast  pathways  are 
implemented by a ResNet-101. 

We  split  the  annotated  dataset  AnnotationsActions  (cf.  Section  2.2) 
randomly (but fixed for all experiments and all networks) into a train set, 
validation set and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of 
each class. Of the remaining clips, again 20% of the clips in each class 
form the validation set. The remaining clips are the training set.

4.4. Action recognition 

The three ResNet variants are trained for 40 epochs starting with an 
initial learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate is decreased every 10 
epochs by multiplying it with a γ = 0.1. For optimization we utilize the 
Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  with  a  momentum  of  0.9  and  a

To  combine  the  features  from  the  Fast  pathway  with  the  Slow 
pathway  the  authors  use  lateral  connections.  They  are  unidirectional 
and  go  from  the  Fast  pathway  to  the  Slow  pathway.  The  lateral  con-
nections  are  positioned  after  each  building  block  of  the  ResNet.  The 
structure of a ResNet has already been described in Section 3.2.1. 

The average pooling is done on both pathways. Then the results of 
both pathways are concatenated and build the input for the fully con-
nected layer. 

The described SlowFast architecture is shown in Fig. 7. 

4. Results and evaluation 

4.1. Evaluation metrics 

We  exemplify  the  evaluation  metrics  that we  use  in  the  following 
sections. We use the  official COCO evaluation metrics  and follow  Lin 
et al. (2014) and Everingham et al. (2010).

3.2.2. SlowFast architecture 

In this section we follow Feichtenhofer et al. (2019). The key idea of 
SlowFast  networks  is  using  two  pathways  for  the  video  input,  a  Slow 
pathway and a Fast pathway. The Slow pathway works on a low frame 
rate  and  low  temporal  resolution  for detecting  spatial  semantics. The 
Fast pathway uses a high frame rate to capture motion and the temporal 
aspects  in  the  video.  Simultaneously  the  Fast  pathway  reduces  its 
channel capacity so it becomes lightweight, but is still able to learn the 
temporal information of the video. The backbone for the pathways can 
be implemented by different networks. The best results achieve ResNets. 
SlowFast  is  a  single-stream  architecture  that  works  on  two  different 
frame rates. 

The Slow pathway uses a large temporal stride τ on the input frames. 

The pathway considers one out of τ frames from the video.
