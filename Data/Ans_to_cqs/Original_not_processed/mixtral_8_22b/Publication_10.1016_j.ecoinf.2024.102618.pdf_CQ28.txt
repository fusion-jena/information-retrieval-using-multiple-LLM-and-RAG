provide crystal-clear images for further examination. The added image 
enhancement  technique  enabled  the  proposed  systems  to  reach  high 
accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

• EfficientNetB0 EfficientNet is a CNN architecture and scaling method 
that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. EfficientNetB0 (Tan 
and Le, 2019) is a network that is trained on more than a million 
images from the ImageNet database.  

• EfficientNetB3 

EfficientNetB3 (Tan and Le, 2019) is another network of the Effi-
cientNet  family.  EfficientNetB3  comes  from  scaling  EfficientNetB0 
which was generated using AutoML.  

• InceptionResNetv2 

InceptionResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) is a CNN network that 
builds on the inception family of architectures. However, the model 
incorporates residual connections instead of the filter concatenation 
stage of the inception family.  

• ResNet50v2 

(Gomez et al., 2017) ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture that 
is  50  layers  deep.  ResNet50v2  is  also  trained  on  a  million  images 
from the ImageNet dataset.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment based on the given context.
