Further  discussions  analyze  IFTL  and  FTL  for  their  abilities  to 
improve learning by restricting overconfidence (controlling hesitancy) 
during TL by considering GRNN and SVR as the TUR. Overconfidence in 
ELM,  GRNN,  or  SVR  arises  when  they  make  predictions  on  a  dataset 
(target  domain) that has a huge data distribution difference from the 
source domain data on which they are trained. In this scenario, they just 
use their training experience to make predictions during testing without 
considering the distribution divergence in the testing dataset from the 
training  dataset.  We  conclude  this  section  with  the  execution  time 
analysis of the approaches.  

a)  GDP prediction using only CO2 emission data2

b)  IFTL Refinement over GRNN and SVR 

In previous results, ELM is chosen as TUR, and IFTL is implemented 
on the ELM predictions to improve its knowledge transfer. Here, GRNN 
and SVR are chosen one by one as a TUR model in the process described 
in Fig. 2. Then, IFTL with the same parameter settings (as was in the case 
of ELM in the previous subsection, where γ = 0.1) is applied over their 
prediction. The improvement of IFTL over these approaches are depicted 
in Fig. 6, where ‘GRNN_IF’  denotes the error in IFTL prediction when 
IFTL  is  implemented,  choosing  GRNN  as  TUR.  Similarly,  ‘SVR_IF’  de-
notes the IFTL error when IFTL is implemented, choosing SVR as TUR.

For  evaluating  the  performance  of  machine  learning  algorithms, 
well-known benchmark datasets are utilized, which are partitioned (by 
KFold or StratifiedKFold, etc.) in test data (target domain) and training 
data (source domain). Here both these domains are drawn from the same 
domain distribution; hence both of them are equal in their distribution i. 
e.  Ds = Dt  and  Ts = Tt.  However,  IFTL  is  hypothesized  for  transfer 
learning, and to evaluate its performance precisely, the source domain 
i.e. 
target  domain  must  be  highly  diverse  but  related 
and 
Ds ∕= Dt or Ts ∕= Tt or both.

then combined with common latent feature space to generate one latent 
feature space layer. Moreover, to learn the corresponding distributions 
on different layers, multiple layers are generated which learns with their 
pluralism,  simultaneously.  Salaken  et  al.,  (2019)  employed  deep 
learning in which  a small sample of target domain is  used as seed to 
transform  source  domain  dataset.  Sousa  et  al.,  (2020)  proposed  a 
transfer  learning  approach  with  data  augmentation  techniques  for 
wildfire detection to overcome data limitations.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been taken. Firstly, well-known benchmark datasets are utilized for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms. These datasets are then partitioned into test data (target domain) and training data (source domain) using methods such as KFold or StratifiedKFold. This ensures that both domains are drawn from the same domain distribution, making them equal in their distribution.

However, to evaluate the performance of IFTL (Instance-based Feature Transfer Learning), it is hypothesized for transfer learning, and the source domain (target domain) must be highly diverse but related. Therefore, Ds ≠ Dt or Ts ≠ Tt or both. To achieve this diversity, multiple layers are generated that learn with their pluralism, simultaneously. This allows the model to learn the corresponding distributions on different layers.

Additionally, a small sample of the target domain is used as a seed to transform the source domain dataset. Data augmentation techniques are also employed for wildfire detection to overcome data limitations. These measures help to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by allowing it to handle diverse datasets and learn from them effectively.
