The river runoff variation given in Fig. 8(a) shows a decrease in the 
volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3  to 700 Mm3, which means 
that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth. 
Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which 
can generally be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are 
related  to  human  activities,  which  include  excessive  use  of  water  re-
sources, excessive development of agriculture around the lake, and the 
structures built in the basin. One of the human activities is changing the 
cultivation  pattern  and  creating  unconventional  deep  wells  in  the  re-
gion, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of 
water-based  agricultural  products  increased  from  350,000  ha  to 
500,000 ha. The construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the 
catchment  water  of  the  lake,  which,  with  these  unplanned  dams  and

The CMAP is a collection of precipitation datasets that can be pro-
duced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipi-
and its temporal 
tation. The spatial resolution of the CMAP is 2.5
resolution is monthly. The data of CMAP can be downloaded from the 
NOAA repository (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html). 
Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water 
surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e. 1985 
to 2020). For this aim, the most suitable data in terms of identifiability 
(i.e. frames with cloud cover <10%) was selected. It takes eight “Landsat 
frames” to cover the entire Urmia Lake basin. In the present study, 150 
images from 1985 to 2020 were used to assess land cover variations in 
the  selected  basin.  To  minimize  the  radiometric  effects,  radiometric 
calibration was done for the selected images.

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These methods help ensure that the model generalizes well and does not favor any particular class or feature. Some commonly used techniques are:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both subsets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class.

2. Oversampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, where some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, oversampling can be applied. This technique duplicates examples from the minority class until it reaches a more balanced ratio with the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can also be used to handle imbalanced datasets. Instead of increasing the number of minority class instances, this approach reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing samples. However, care must be taken to avoid losing valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data helps reduce bias in the dataset. By gathering data from various sources, demographics, and environments, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling different scenarios.

These techniques can be combined or used individually depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset.
