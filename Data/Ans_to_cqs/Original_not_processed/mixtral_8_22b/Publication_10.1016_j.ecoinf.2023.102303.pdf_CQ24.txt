Gradient boosting refers to a class of ensemble Decision Tree (DT) 
algorithms  that  can  be  used  in  classification,  regression,  and  ranking 
applications (Badirli et al., 2020). However, gradient boosting leaves the 
width and depth dimensions of its DTs, along with the number of DTs in 
the ensemble adjustable. This leads to a vast number of hyperparameters 
that cannot be easily optimized for a given application. In this regard, 
XGBoost  was originally introduced  by Chu (2023) as an efficient and 
distributed gradient boosting algorithm with rapidly optimized hyper-
parameters.  XGBoost  outperforms  individual  DNN  models  when  it 
makes  the  final  decision  in  their  ensemble  (Shwartz-Ziv  and  Armon, 
2022).  It  is  therefore  beneficial  to  use  an  ensemble  of  DNNs  with 
XGBoost, which can perform better than any individual model, as well as 
other classical ensemble techniques (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022).

4. Discussions 

The  development  of  deep  learning  methodologies  continues  to 
advance at an astonishing rate and be applied to various applications 
ranging from biomedical (Azghadi et al., 2020), hydrological processes 
in river channels (Talukdar et al., 2023) and agricultural (Olsen et al., 
2019) systems, to marine (Laradji et al., 2021; Saleh et al., 2022b), and 
environmental (Jahanbakht et al., 2022a) sciences. The application of 
deep learning technologies has been also used in profiling the ecosystem 
services of estuarine habitats by community members (Yee et al., 2023). 
In this paper, we extend the application of deep learning methodologies 
to advance state-of-the-art underwater fish video processing techniques 
applied to turbid waters.

We collected the FishInTurbidWater dataset and quickly and weakly 
labeled  it  to  contribute  to  the  first  weakly-supervised  fish  dataset  in 
turbid  waters.  We,  then  used  this  dataset  to  develop  two  novel  deep 
learning networks, one using semi-supervised contrastive learning for 
significantly  accelerated  model  deployment  time,  and  one  weakly- 
supervised  model  to  shorten  deployment  time,  while  providing  high 
accuracy. 

For  semi-supervised  contrastive  learning,  we  first  trained  a  self- 
supervised  contrastive  learning  model  and  then  fine-tuned  it  on  our

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, I can provide some general insights into how this issue is typically addressed.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like weight initialization, shuffling training examples, or dropout regularization. To manage these sources of randomness, researchers often employ several strategies:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is setting fixed random seeds during experimentation. By specifying a particular seed value, developers ensure that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time they run their code. This practice promotes reproducibility and allows others to reproduce results accurately.

2. Multiple Runs Averaging: Another strategy involves running experiments multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results. This technique helps mitigate the impact of randomness and provides more robust performance estimates.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Researchers may also tune hyperparameters related to randomness, such as the dropout rate or batch size, to minimize the effects of randomness on model performance.

While the provided context doesn't directly address handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, these general strategies can help manage randomness and improve the reliability of experimental results.
