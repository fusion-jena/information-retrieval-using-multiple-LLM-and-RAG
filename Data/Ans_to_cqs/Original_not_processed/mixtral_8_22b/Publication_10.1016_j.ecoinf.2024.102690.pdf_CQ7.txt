Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

4.4.3. Ecological barriers 

Based on the characteristics of each scenario, the search radius for 
ecological  barriers  was  set  as  follows.  A  search  radius  of  320  m  was 
established in Scenario A by computing the total area of cropland and 
the  accompanying  cropland  pressure  index  for  each  sub-district  in 
Guangzhou. Based on pertinent planning documents, the search radius 
was set to 200 m for Scenario B and 500 m for Scenario C. 

Six barriers were identified in Scenario A, where the land-use type 
was dominated by water bodies (Fig. 6c), mainly located in the south-

2)  Three  scenarios  were  established  based  on  identifying  service 
bundles: product supply, water conservation, and habitat maintenance. 
The  number  of  sources  was  11,  4,  and  4  for  each  type,  respectively, 
accounting for 37.6% of the total area of the region. Under these three 
scenarios, 30, 36, and 36 ecological corridors were identified and clas-
sified into five categories. 

3) In Guangzhou, the minimum area threshold for ecological sources 
is 10 km2. The CWD values for identifying ecological pinch points were 
20,000,  62,000,  and  93,000  for  the  three  scenarios,  while  the  search 
radii for ecological barriers were 320, 200, and 500 m.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. Typically, the ratio used is 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation. This allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, evaluate its performance with unseen data during testing, and fine-tune hyperparameters during validation.
