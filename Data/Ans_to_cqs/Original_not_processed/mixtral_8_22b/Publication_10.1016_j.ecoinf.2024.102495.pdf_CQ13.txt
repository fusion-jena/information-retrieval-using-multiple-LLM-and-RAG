The model parameters were tuned to increase model accuracy. Some 
model  parameters  or  hyperparameters  were  varied  to  evaluate  the 
performance of the given model. The model with the best performance 
was selected from several other models with different parameter vari-
ations.  However,  parameter  tuning  was  limited  to  a  few  hyper-
parameters  because  of  the  large  number  of  parameters  in  the  CNN 
model. The model parameters that varied were the optimization algo-
rithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. The following are

The CNN model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 
32,  respectively.  This  model  was  compiled  using  a  categorical  cross- 
entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters used in the CNN algo-
rithm  were  tuned  using  a  root  mean  square  propagation  (RMSProp) 
optimizer. The model generated in the training process was evaluated 
using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accu-
racy,  precision,  recall,  F1-Score,  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  score, 
confusion  matrix,  and  model  training  time  for  binary  and  multiclass 
classifications (Forman and Scholz, 2010; Grandini et al., 2020; Ouyang 
et al., 2015). The model performance needs to be evaluated to determine 
the modelâ€™s ability to classify mosquitoes, and a good model is charac-
terized by high values of predetermined performance parameters.

The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the optimization algorithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. Specifically, the model was compiled using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and a root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. The learning rates used were 0.001 and 0.01, while the optimizers included RMSProp, Adam, and SGD. A dropout layer was also applied to prevent overfitting.
