Algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022 were evalu-
ated using various deep learning models, as summarized in Table 3. The 
hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  demonstrated 
superior  performance 
throughout  the  year,  achieving  the  highest  values  for  POD  and  HSS 
compared to other models. Notably, the LSTM model outperformed the 
CNN model. The Zhoushan fishery exhibits pronounced seasonal varia-
tion in algal blooms, with the highest occurrence in summer, totaling 
8468 bloom days, followed by Spring with 4720 bloom days. Among all 
seasonal forecasts, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved 
the  highest  HSS  values.  Specifically,  during  the  peak  algal  bloom 
occurrence in summer, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model excelled with both 
POD and HSS at 0.32. In contrast, during winter and autumn, the hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model displayed lower HSS values, primarily due to elevated 
FAR.  Across  all  model  forecasts  and  seasonal  variations,  the  POCR

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. However, it can be inferred that some form of validation was performed since evaluation metrics such as R2 and RMSE are presented. Additionally, the use of diverse datasets could also be implied through the utilization of different deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and their combination (CNN-LSTM). Nevertheless, without further details regarding the methodology or experimental setup, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed to enhance the model's generalizability.
