predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided references directly address this specific topic. Nevertheless, some general strategies for managing randomness in machine learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, employing ensemble methods, and applying regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. These strategies help mitigate the effects of randomness and improve the robustness and reliability of the results. It is important to note that each strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their effectiveness may vary depending on the specific application and dataset.

Unhelpful Answer:
None of the provided references discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer based solely on these references.
