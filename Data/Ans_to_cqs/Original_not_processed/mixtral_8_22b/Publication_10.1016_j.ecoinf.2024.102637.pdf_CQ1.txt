This study conducted experiments on the Birdsdata and UrbanSound 
datasets, fully demonstrating our significant advantages in terms of ac-
curacy and inference time through comparison with other methods. The 
specific data are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 13. Our model significantly 
reduces the inference time while maintaining high accuracy. Compared 
with  other  networks,  the  experimental  data  show  that  the  SIAlex 
network on the Birdsdata dataset improves the accuracy to 93.66%, and 
the inference time for a single data is only 2.466 ms. The accuracy of the 
UrbanSound8k  dataset  reaches  96.04%,  and  the  inference  time  for  a 
single data is 3.031 ms. Meanwhile, it can be observed that compared 
with existing lightweight models (Sandler et al., 2018), (Zhang et al., 
2018), (Tan and Le, 2019), the proposed model demonstrates superior 
performance.

In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about two publicly available datasets used in this research: the UrbanSound8K dataset and the Birdsdata dataset. These datasets are accessible via Kaggle, which is a platform for sharing and discovering open datasets. Therefore, it can be inferred that one method for obtaining raw data in this case was through utilizing these pre-existing public datasets.

Public datasets like those mentioned above often contain data collected from various sources, including sensors or surveys. For instance, audio datasets might involve recordings captured by microphones or other types of sensors. In the absence of explicit details regarding the collection process, it is safe to assume that the datasets were compiled using appropriate methods relevant to their respective domains.

To summarize, although the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline remain unspecified, it is evident that the researchers made use of two openly accessible datasets—UrbanSound8K and Birdsdata—which likely encompass data gathered through suitable means pertinent to their fields.
