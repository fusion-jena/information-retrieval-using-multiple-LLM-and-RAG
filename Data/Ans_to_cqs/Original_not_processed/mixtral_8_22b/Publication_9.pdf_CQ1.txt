Abstract

1.  Digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big data-

sets and typically must be pre- processed prior to conducting analyses. One crucial 

image pre- processing step in any image analysis workflow is image segmentation, 

or the ability to clearly contrast the foreground target from the background noise 

in an image. This procedure is typically done manually, creating a potential bot-

tleneck for efforts to quantify biodiversity from image databases. Image segmen-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big datasets, suggesting that digital imagery or scanning might be used for data collection. Additionally, the reference to the study by Christin et al. (2019) implies that deep learning could have applications in various fields such as ecology, potentially involving diverse sources of raw data like sensor networks, satellite imagery, or camera traps. Nevertheless, without more explicit information, we cannot definitively state what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
