2.6. Evaluation metric 

This  study  employed  five  metrics,  namely  Accuracy  (A),  Precision 
(P),  Recall  (R),  F1-score  (F1),  and  Intersection  over  Union  (IOU),  to 
assess the effectiveness of the proposed model (Giles et al., 2021). Their 
calculation formulas are shown below:

total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the

network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

Helpful Answer:

The study employs five metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, which are Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). The calculation formulas for these metrics can be found in section 2.6 of the paper. Specifically, the Res\_AUNet network achieved an Accuracy of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73% when tested on the WSGD dataset.
