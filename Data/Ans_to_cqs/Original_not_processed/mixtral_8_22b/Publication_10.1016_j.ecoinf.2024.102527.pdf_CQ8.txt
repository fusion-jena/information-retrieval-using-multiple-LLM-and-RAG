respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information. 

3. Results 

3.1. Experiment results of transfer strategy optimization

Regarding source model construction, we suggest that practitioners 
with abundant computational resources should build the source model 
with a larger number of readily available labeled samples. Doing so can 
contribute  to  improved  transfer  learning  performance.  However,  for 
those  with  limited  computational  resources,  it  may  be  necessary  to 
compromise between sample size and computational resources based on 
the potential threshold effect. 

CRediT authorship contribution statement

When it comes to selecting update layers, we recommend selectively 
updating the last few layers of the DCNN model to enhance its perfor-
mance in empty image recognition. This approach can lead to a signif-
icant  improvement  in  the  model’s  performance,  as  opposed  to  solely 
updating  the  fully  connected  layer.  Specifically,  when  using  a  model 
from  the  ResNext  or  ResNet  family  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  as  the 
source model, we recommend using TLS_4 as the transfer strategy. In 
contexts where pronounced discrepancies exist between the target and 
source  domain  datasets,  it  could  prove  advantageous  to  augment  the 
number of convolutional layers subject to update. For example, in the 
case  of  ResNext  series  models,  using  TLS_3  can  further  enhance  the 
performance of the transfer model.
