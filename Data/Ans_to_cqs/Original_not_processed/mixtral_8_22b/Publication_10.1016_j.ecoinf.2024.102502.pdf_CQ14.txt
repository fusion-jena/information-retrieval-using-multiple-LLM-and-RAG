Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.1. Data filtering

match environmental information with ground observations (e.g. wild-
life  movements),  other  ecological  processes  may  require  coarser  tem-
poral scales, hence more diluted temporal aggregation (e.g. ecosystem 
resilience). As for spatial scaling, a formula defines how data is tempo-
rally aggregated, namely by a mean, median, or standard deviation.

environmental  data  to  ecological  processes  (Chave,  2013;  Pettorelli 
et al., 2014).

namely  round  or  square,  and  size  by  determining  the  number  of 
neighbouring sub-units included (e.g. 3 Ã— 3; Fig. 1). The aggregating 
formula  ranges  from  mean,  median  or  standard  deviation,  to  more 
advanced, like the textural metrics mentioned in Supplementary infor-
mation S1.1.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, it is not possible to determine this based solely on the provided information.
