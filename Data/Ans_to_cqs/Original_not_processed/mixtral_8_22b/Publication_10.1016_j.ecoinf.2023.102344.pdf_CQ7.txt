Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

means the images where the extracted numerical features were used in 
Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in

and  exact  output  data  value.  The  softmax  activation  function  at  the 
output  section  provides  interpretability,  multi-class  classification, 
gradient-based  optimization,  and  cross-entropy  loss  adjustment  capa-
bilities  to  the  network.  With  the  composite  numerical  dataset  in  a 
mathematical array typology of [sampling location (Lm, Mo, Ob, Ta, and 
RF)]  = [R,  a*,  b*,  shell  diameter],  composed  of  300  data-filled  rows 
collected  from  five  location  sites  in  Portugal,  stratified  sampling  was 
employed with 80% (240 data rows) used for training the model and 
20% (60 data rows) for testing. All pre-trained models under Approach 1 
converged  the  training  after  1000  epochs  with  stochastic  gradient 
descent with momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. 

2.5. Approach 2: Traceability modelling using image-based pre-trained 
network

Approach 3 utilized the same PCA-NCA-selected bivalve features of 
Approach  1  as  inputs  to  six  combination  models  of  3-layer  sequence 
neural  networks  that  are  primarily  composed  of  LSTM,  GRU,  and 
BiLSTM. The six developed models using sequence neural networks are 
hybrid PCA-NCA and GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM sequence (BivalveNet), LSTM- 
GRU-BiLSTM, LSTM-BiLSTM-GRU, GRU-BiLSTM-LSTM, BiLSTM-LSTM- 
GRU,  and  BiLSTM-GRU-LSTM  (Fig.  10),  and  among  these  predictive 
traceability models, the GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM resulted as the most accu-
rate, sensitive, and specific model with the following scores, 96.91%, 
96%, and 96%, respectively (Table 1). Hence, the GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM is 
considered the BivalveNet. Interestingly, BivalveNet has the lowest fall- 
out of 4% among all models among Approaches 1 to 3 which means that 
it has the lowest misprediction instances for both false positive and false 
negative (Table 1). This claim is supported by the confusion matrix in

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the data was divided based on a common practice in machine learning called stratified sampling. In this approach, the data is split such that each set maintains the same proportions of class labels or target variables as present in the original dataset.

From the given text, we learn that the dataset consisted of 300 data-filled rows collected from five different locations in Portugal. These rows contained composite numerical data related to bivalves. To create the training and testing datasets, stratified sampling was employed. Specifically, 80% of the data (240 data rows) was allocated for training the model, while the remaining 20% (60 data rows) was reserved for testing purposes.

Although the text does not provide explicit details about the validation set, typically, a portion of the training data is further separated into a validation set. This validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. It should also be noted that the optimal ratio for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset, its complexity, and the nature of the problem being addressed.
