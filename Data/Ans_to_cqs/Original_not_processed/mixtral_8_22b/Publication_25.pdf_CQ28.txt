samples will be needed to customize the model to a local geographic area. In addition, the availability
of hyperspectral data could assist in dividing the ‘tree’ class into multiple species labels. This would
yield additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for
large geographic areas [39]. While further work is needed to understand the best way to combine data
among scales and sensors, we show that deep learning-based approaches hold the potential for large
scale actionable information on natural systems to be derived from remote sensing data.

1. Introduction

Image-based artiﬁcial intelligence can advance our understanding of individual organisms, species,
and ecosystems by greatly increasing the scale and eﬃciency of data collection [1]. The growing
availability of sub-meter airborne imagery brings opportunities for the remote sensing of biological
landscapes that scales from individual organisms to global systems. However, the laborious,
non-reproducible, and costly annotation of these datasets limits the use of this imagery [2].

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention any specific platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based solely on the given information.
