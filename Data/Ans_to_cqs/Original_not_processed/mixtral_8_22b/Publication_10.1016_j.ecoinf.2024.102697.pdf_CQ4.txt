Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

2.7. Machine learning training methodology 

To ensure accuracy and reliability of results, a repeated nested k-fold 
cross-validation approach was employed for all ML models developed 
here. An outer 10 k-fold cross-validation provided an initial division of 
the data into holdout data and data for model development (Molinaro 
et al., 2005). An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation was then used to mini-
mize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results, as 
demonstrated in previous studies (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Yates et al., 
2022).  The  training  performance  was  calculated  based  on  the  inner 
cross-validated  ensemble,  while  the  testing  performance  was  deter-
mined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire 
training set to predict on the holdout data. This process was repeated 15 
times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance 
related to random sampling (Kim, 2009).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions the use of machine learning techniques, specifically random forest models, which are known for their effectiveness across various applications. These models operate under the concept of ensemble learning, where multiple randomized decision trees are generated based on subsets of input features. The final output is obtained by averaging the results from each tree, resulting in a more reliable outcome compared to individual trees.

Moreover, the text discusses the application of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach for developing machine learning models. This method ensures the accuracy and reliability of results by dividing the data into holdout data and data for model development. It also minimizes bias caused by hyperparameter tuning through an inner 5 k-fold cross-validation. The training performance is determined based on the inner cross-validated ensemble, while the testing performance is established by choosing the best set of hyperparameters from the whole training set to forecast on the holdout data. This process is repeated 15 times for every distinct model to mitigate potential biases and variances related to random sampling.
