System, n.d.). Table 1 shows the specific data types and their sources.

Its  data  sources  mainly  include  the  following:  (1)  The  nighttime 
lighting data is extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data for 2000–2021. The 
dataset  is  available  for  free  download  at  the  National  Earth  System 
Science Data Centre (National Earth System Science Data Center, n.d.). 
(2) Provincial statistical energy data for 2000–2021 are obtained from 
the China Statistical Yearbook (China Statistical Press, n.d.), municipal 
statistical data are obtained from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook (Xi'an 
Municipal  Bureau  of  Statistics,  n.d.),  and  carbon  emission  factors  for 
various energy sources are obtained from the “2019 Refinement to the 
2006  IPCC  Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventory”.  (3) 
Administrative  boundary  data  for  Xi'an  (district,  county,  and  street 
administrative  boundaries)  were  provided  by  the  National  Basic 
Geographic Information System (National Basic Geographic Information

where  i  is  the  type  of  energy  source;  Gi  is  the  annual  consumption 
amount of energy i, Ei  is the standard coal conversion factor of energy 
source type i, and each type of energy consumption can be converted to 
standard coal consumption based on its calorific value; Ki is the emission 
coefficient of CO2 for each type of energy source; and 44/12 is the molar 
ratio of CO2  to C. The energy consumption statistics of this study are 
broadly classified into nine categories, encompassing raw coal, crude, 
coke, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. However, it discusses various data sources used in the research, including nighttime lighting data, provincial statistical energy data, administrative boundary data, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources. These data sources may come in different formats like text, numerical data, or geospatial data. Without further details about the processing methods or analysis techniques employed in the study, it is difficult to determine if these data sources are used in a deep learning pipeline or what specific data formats they might take within such a pipeline.
