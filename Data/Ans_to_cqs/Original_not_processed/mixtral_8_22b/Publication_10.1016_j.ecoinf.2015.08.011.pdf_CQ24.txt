For the purpose of prediction, the most important property of a
model is its competence to generalize. While generalization compe-
tence indicates a model's power to perform well on data that were not
used to train it, overﬁtting prevents model generalization in the face
of new situations (Schlink et al., 2003). To avoid overﬁtting, early stop-
ping the most frequently used regularization technique was employed.
In order to apply it, the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for
model training (to compute the gradient and updating of the network
parameters, such as weights and biases—the training set) and 20% for
model testing (to test the model error validation—the validation set).
The model weights were randomly initialized and the training process
was stopped when the network began to overﬁt the data, i.e., the
error on the validation set.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.

The ANN requires that the learning rate, number of nodes in a single
hidden layer, and maximum number of training epochs are speciﬁed
(Hill and Minsker, 2010). In this study, we used the optimal number
error approach. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied be-
tween 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in in-
crements of 0.05. For each conﬁguration, the mean square error (MSE)
between the model output and the measured data was calculated.
Fig 2 illustrates the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer

and the optimal learning rate having the maximum model performance
as indicated by MSE. The number of neurons in the hidden layer and the
optimal learning rate were selected using a trial-and-error method.
The ﬁnal ANN structure had ﬁve input variables with one node
accounting for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node accounting for
bias, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable of the output layer
(Figs. 2 and 3).

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of handling randomness specifically related to the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. However, some strategies can be inferred based on the information available.

One strategy mentioned to prevent overfitting, which could be considered a form of managing randomness, is early stopping. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation dataset during training and halting the training process once the model starts to overfit the data. This helps ensure that the model does not become excessively specialized to the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data.

Additionally, the context mentions splitting the dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for testing. By separating these datasets, the model can be trained on one portion while being evaluated on another, providing a more accurate assessment of its ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the text discusses selecting the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate through a trial-and-error method. This iterative process allows for experimentation with different configurations to find the optimal combination that minimizes the mean squared error between the model output and the measured data. Although not explicitly stated, this approach could also help manage randomness by finding the configuration that performs best across multiple trials.

Lastly, the context describes using a final ANN structure with five input variables, one node for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node for bias, a learning rate of 0.7, and one output variable. This specific architecture may have been chosen after evaluating various configurations, further demonstrating the use of systematic methods to address potential sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
