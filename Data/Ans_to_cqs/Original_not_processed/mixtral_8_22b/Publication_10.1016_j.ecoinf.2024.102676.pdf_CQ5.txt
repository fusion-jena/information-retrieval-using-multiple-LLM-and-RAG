To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, the provided information does not explicitly mention any particular dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer based solely on the given context.

However, the context mentions a study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species where a model trained on images of all qualities was compared to a model trained on high-quality prints. It can be inferred that the datasets used in this study likely consisted of images of otter footprints, but no specific details regarding the source or nature of these datasets were provided.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline for enhancing the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method. While this suggests that the datasets may have contained missing values, there is still no explicit mention of any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, without more specific information regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to definitively identify them.
