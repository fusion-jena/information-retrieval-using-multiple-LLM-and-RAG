3.1. DeepLabV3+ algorithm 

DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which 
is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family (Scepanovic et al., 
2021).  In  the  encoding  stage,  DeepLabV3+ introduces  dilated  convo-
lutions,  which expands  the  receptive field  without losing information 
(Fig.  3).  The  Atrous  spatial  pyramid  pooling  module  with  dilated 
convolution  has  been  mainly  designed  to  appropriately  incorporate 
multi-scale information. During decoding, it is capable of enhancing the 
accuracy  of  segmentation  boundaries  by  further  integrating  low-level 
features with high-level features (Liu et al., 2021a).

During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions some methods employed during the training process of the DeepLabV3+ model, which could potentially help mitigate data bias. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: This technique involves creating new samples from existing ones by applying transformations like flipping, exchanging between multiple image channels, random rotation, and adding noise. This can help increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

2. Sample Size Maximization: By cutting all remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks, the authors aimed to maximize the sample size. This approach might indirectly contribute to reducing data bias by ensuring a larger and more representative dataset.

3. Consistent Cropping Approach: Maintaining consistency with the cropping approach in the model prediction stage during the preprocessing phase could also aid in preventing potential biases introduced by inconsistencies in data preparation.
