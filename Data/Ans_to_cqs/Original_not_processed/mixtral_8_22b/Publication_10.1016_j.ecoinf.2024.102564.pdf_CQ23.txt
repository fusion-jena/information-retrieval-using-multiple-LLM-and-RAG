Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

The evaluated models generally showed satisfactory generalization 
power, indicated by similar precision results between the observed and 
estimated data in the validation for all variables studied (Fig. 4). The 
evaluation of generalization power is crucial to ensure a model’s reli-
ability  and  applicability  in  real-world  scenarios.  By  demonstrating 
satisfactory  precision  and  similar  performance  across  the  variables 
studied,  our  models  demonstrated  their  robustness  and  suitability  for 
predicting tree growth in the Atlantic Forest. 

RF showed the best performance to estimate net growth, with the 
highest ryˆy  and the lowest RMSE and MAE for all repetitions (Table 2). 
This  suggests  that  the  RF  model  is  highly  effective  in  accurately  pre-
dicting net growth in the Atlantic Forest.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study utilized a diverse dataset consisting of various variables related to tree growth in the Atlantic Forest. This diversity in the dataset helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the study employed cross-validation techniques during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, where one fold is used for testing while the remaining folds are used for training. This process is repeated until every fold has been used for testing once. Cross-validation helps assess how well the model will perform on new, unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting. Lastly, stratified splitting was likely applied when partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets. Stratified splitting ensures that both sets maintain the same distribution of target variable values, which can help improve the model's predictive accuracy and reduce bias. These measures collectively contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model and its applicability in real-world scenarios.
