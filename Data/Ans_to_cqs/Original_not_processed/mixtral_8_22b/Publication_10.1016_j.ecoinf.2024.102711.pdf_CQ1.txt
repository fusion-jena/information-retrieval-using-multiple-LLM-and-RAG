2.5. Automated machine learning (AutoML) 

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed.

line with the fact that the dataset is limited, comprising only 113 data 
records.  TABPFN  is  better  suited  to  perform  well  on  such  a  limited 
dataset (Hollmann et al., 2022).

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  modelâ€™s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific method or source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning applications. Some common sources include online databases, publicly available datasets, sensor readings, satellite imagery, drone footage, IoT devices, social media platforms, and even manual surveys. It depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the availability of relevant data.

The mentioned paper uses a dataset consisting of 113 data records but does not specify how these data records were collected. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact method used for gathering raw data in this particular case.
