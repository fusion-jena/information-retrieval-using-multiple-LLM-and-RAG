%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it provides references to various research papers related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning applications in agriculture and forestry. Therefore, I cannot determine which datasets were used in these studies without further information.
