cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

comprehensive graph matching software within the Wild Me software 
suite for cleaning data at the standard suitable for deep learning algo-
rithms. Two manual observers participated in exhaustive rounds of ID 
decisions in a process called graph matching of the 12,311 annotations, 
whereby  two  images  are  placed  side  by  side,  and  the  observer  de-
termines  whether  the  images  are  the  same  individual  or  different  in-
dividuals (same animal, different animal, cannot tell), and ranks their 
level  of  certainty  (undeniable,  certain,  somewhat  certain,  mostly  un-
certain, completely uncertain). This level of comprehensive individual 
ID enabled the subsets of our dataset to have the highest certainty for 
imagery from a field-based dataset.

It is essential to accurately reidentify species to generate valid pop-
ulation  estimates,  which  in  turn  inform  numerous  critical  ecological 
issues.  Whiskerbook.org  is  a  platform  for  big  cat  ecologists  that  in-
corporates deep learning into an ecological research tool, removing a 
significant barrier and giving ecologists direct access to deep learning 
technology for photo reidentification (Berger-Wolf et al., 2017; Blount 
et al., 2018, 2021b; Bohnett et al., 2023). According to the results of this 
research, the combination of the PIE and Hotspotter algorithms offers an 
improvement to the methods on Whiskerbook.org for image reidentifi-
cation of snow leopards, finding an 85% Rank-1 accuracy for matching 
individuals.  The  PIE  algorithm  performed  the  best  with  background 
subtraction  and  data  augmentation  with  left-right  mirroring,  which 
significantly  reduced  overfitting.  When  it  comes  to  animal  reidentifi-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the deep learning technology for photo reidentification is available through Whiskerbook.org, a platform for big cat ecologists. It also states that Microsoft sponsored Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. Therefore, while I can't provide a direct link to the code repository, it seems likely that further information regarding the deep learning pipeline could be found on Whiskerbook.org or related resources.
