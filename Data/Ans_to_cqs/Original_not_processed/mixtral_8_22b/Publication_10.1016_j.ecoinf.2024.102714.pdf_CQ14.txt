based on the seasonal behaviour and respective spectral/backscatter
annual profiles. The model parameters – number of trees, maximum
depth of trees, subsample ratio of columns used for each tree, and model
learning rate - were fine-tuned through a random grid search approach.
Following map production, post-classification refinement was un-
dertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas (e.g.,
swamp in southern Pembrokeshire). This required additional training
data in areas known to be misclassified, with this obtained through
aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits. Following
reclassification of the VTs, the final nine-class VT map was generated.

The LWHabmod was clipped with the harmonised GMEPmod squares.
Given the marginal coverage of calcareous grassland and raised bog in
GMEP, these classes were omitted leaving 15 classes to compare.
Stratified random sampling points were generated using QGIS’ ACa-
TAMa plug-in (Llano, 2023). The number of points per class was
increased by 5-fold (to 1500) based on the minimum deemed necessary
in guidelines given by (Olofsson et al., 2014; see Eq. 3) to account for
bias associated with restricted inclusion probabilities that result from
the pre-defined distribution of GMEP squares. The initial validation
label for every point was sourced from GMEPmod and every point

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random grid search approach. This method involves randomly selecting combinations of hyperparameter values from a specified range and evaluating their performance on the dataset. After trying multiple combinations, the best set of hyperparameters is chosen based on the highest accuracy or lowest error achieved during the evaluation process. In this case, the model parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, subsample ratio of columns used for each tree, and model learning rate were all fine-tuned using this approach.
