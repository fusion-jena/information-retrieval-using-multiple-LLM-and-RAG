lationships among features. Unlike channel attention, which emphasizes 
‘what’ is meaningful within an input, spatial attention is concerned with 
‘where’ the informative regions are located, offering a complementary 
perspective. To create the spatial attention map, the SA branch begins by 
separately applying global average pooling and max pooling operations 
along the channel dimensions of the feature map F as give by eq.2 and 
eq.3. The global average pooling is expressed as:

ple scales, while the third subnetwork focuses on preserving intricate 
spatial details. A detailed enhancement block and a supervised recovery 
block  were  also  incorporated  between  these  subnetworks  to  enhance 
color accuracy further and refine fine details in the image restoration

Fig. 1. Proposed Dehazing Model Training Process: An input image transforms within our generator network, integral to a GAN model. The resultant output image 
undergoes rigorous evaluation by a discriminator network, in conjunction with a reference image, for authenticity assessment. The generator refines its output based 
on this evaluation, iteratively crafting more realistic images. Its objective is to strategically deceive the discriminator while aligning with the characteristics of the 
reference image, thereby mastering the nuances of image enhancement.

A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training process. However, it does provide some clues about possible postprocessing steps through the use of metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE in evaluating the performance of different models. These metrics suggest that there may be some form of quality assessment or scoring involved in the postprocessing stage. Additionally, the use of a discriminator network in the proposed dehazing model suggests that there could be some form of validation or verification step involved in the postprocessing stage. Overall, without explicit information regarding the postprocessing steps, we cannot definitively state what those steps might entail beyond speculation based on the available context.
