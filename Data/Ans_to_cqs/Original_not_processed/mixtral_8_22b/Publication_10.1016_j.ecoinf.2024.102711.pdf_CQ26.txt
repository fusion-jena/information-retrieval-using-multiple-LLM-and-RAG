for machine learning applications (Patki et al., 2016). This approach has 
been utilized to improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning 
models by increasing both the quantity (i.e., enlarging the input dataset 
(Khanmohammadi et al., 2023a) and quality (e.g., addressing imbalance 
issues  (Khanmohammadi  et  al.,  2023b))  of  the  original  real-world 
datasets.  This  is  particularly  observed  with  classifier  models,  with 
their  performance  being  negatively  affected  by  imbalanced  datasets 
(Arashpour et al., 2021).

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  modelâ€™s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

increased as the volume of data records expands. Because synthetic data 
records are generated from real data records, higher quantities of data 
result in higher-quality synthetic records,  which in turn exert a  more 
significant influence on model performance. However, the 80/20 ratio 
used in our analysis that produced the best results is likely only valid for 
our  dataset.  Had  the  dataset  been  larger,  different  ratios  between 
development  and  evaluation  portions  might  have  produced  better  re-
sults.  This  underscores  the  importance  of  a  cautious  and  thorough 
evaluation when using synthetic data records as a strategy for address-
ing 
improving  ML  model  prediction

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of imbalanced datasets affecting the performance of classifier models. One approach mentioned to tackle this problem is through the generation of synthetic data records, which can help increase both the quantity and quality of the original real-world datasets. The process involves dividing the development dataset into a training dataset and a tuning dataset, followed by employing k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning due to its benefits in enhancing the model's generalization ability. Although the text doesn't directly state the use of diverse data collection, generating synthetic data records from real data records could be considered a form of diversifying the dataset.
