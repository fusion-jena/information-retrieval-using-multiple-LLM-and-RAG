A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

Similarity  Index.  These  metrics  enable  an  objective  evaluation  of  the 
method's performance. Higher PSNR and SSIM scores indicate a closer 
resemblance of the result to the reference image.

6.2. Non-Reference Evaluation 

In the evaluation of test datasets that do not contain reference im-
ages, three non-reference metrics, namely UCIQE (Yang and Sowmya, 
2015) and UIQM (Panetta et al., 2016), and NIQE (Mittal et al., 2013) 
are used. A higher score in either UCIQE or UIQM signifies an enhanced 
level of human visual perception in the results. At the same time, a lower 
NIQE score indicates a better perception quality. In evaluating the C-60 
challenge  dataset, our method  demonstrated remarkable performance 
across various quality metrics. As shown in Table 2. Our method ach-
ieved the highest UIQM score of 3.12, surpassing all other approaches. 
Funie-GAN  achieved  the  second-highest  UIQM  score  of  3.10.  When 
considering  a  balance  between  chroma,  contrast,  and  saturation,  our 
method  once  again  excelled  with  the  highest  UCIQE  score  of  0.591, 
followed  closely  by  Water-Net  with  a  score  of  0.578.  In  terms  of

Helpful Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. UIQM stands for Underwater Image Quality Measure, which assesses the underwater image quality based on colorfulness, sharpness, and contrast. UCIQE represents Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation, focusing on color features like chromatic moments and saturation. Lastly, NIQE refers to Natural Image Quality Evaluation, which uses statistical features to measure perceptual quality.

The tables presented showcase the quantitative comparisons of different methods using these metrics. For instance, in Table 2, the proposed method achieves the highest UIQM score of 3.12 and the highest UCIQE score of 0.591 when compared to other techniques. Similarly, in Table 3, the suggested approach obtains the best UIQM score of 3.23 and the top UCIQE score of 0.612 among its competitors.

These metrics allow for an objective assessment of the model's performance. Higher values in UIQM and UCIQE suggest improved visual perception in the outcomes, while a lower NIQE score implies superior perceptual quality.
