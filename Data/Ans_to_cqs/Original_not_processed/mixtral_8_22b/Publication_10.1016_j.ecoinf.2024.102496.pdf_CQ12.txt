Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

loads  within

Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any details about the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what type of deep learning model, if any, is being used in the pipeline.
