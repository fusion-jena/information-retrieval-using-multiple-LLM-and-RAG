extreme  CHM  values  (increasing  the  Rao’s  Q  and  CV  values  in  our 
study). Lang10m, having a finer spatial resolution (derived fusing GEDI 
data and Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm), is more 
spatially  precise  and,  in  our  areas  characterized  by  a  generally  high

2022),  biomass  density  (Duncanson  et  al.,  2022),  forest  fuels  classifi-
cation (Hoffr´en et al., 2023) and surface elevation (Quir´os et al., 2021) 
which are key components for a global monitoring of forest ecosystems. 
Limitations at local scale arise because of the generalized footprint and 
the  sparse  sampling  design  (Liu  et  al.,  2022).  To  extrapolate  GEDI 
samples  for  continuous  information  on  vegetation  structure,  multiple 
approaches  have  been  developed  fusing  GEDI  samples  with  passive 
optical images in machine learning models (Liu et al., 2022; Rishmawi 
et al., 2021; Kacic et al., 2021). At global scale, Potapov et al. (2021) 
made use of machine learning algorithms to compute and derive a global 
forest  canopy  height  map  (hereafter  “Potapov30m”)  at  30  m  spatial 
resolution fusing GEDI and phenology metrics based on Landsat 8 OLI 
imagery. More recently Lang et al. (2022), Lang et al. (2022), produced a

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
