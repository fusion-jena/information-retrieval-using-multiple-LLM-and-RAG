In the domain of WSM utilizing ML models, optimizing data struc-
tures is paramount. Our study’s engagement with this challenge has led 
to identifying efficient data structures for ML classification. This opti-
mization focuses on the strategic selection of predictors from S2 imagery 
and  the  integration  of  XAI  techniques.  Specifically,  we  optimize  the 
input  matrix  X  = i  × j,  where  I  represents  the  number  of  predictors 
(columns) and j represents the number of training points (rows). We aim 
to select the 12 most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

uous parameters. Following the random search, we utilize GridSearchCV 
to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  in  the  vicinity  of  the  best  hyper-
parameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evalu-
ates  every  possible  combination  within  a  predefined  grid  of 
hyperparameter  values,  guaranteeing  that  the  optimal  parameter

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models and the optimization of data structures for ML classification tasks. In particular, the focus is on selecting relevant predictors from S2 imagery and integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques. For hyperparameter optimization, the study employs RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV methods from the scikit-learn library to improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. These methods help navigate large hyperparameter spaces and incorporate prior knowledge during exploration.

Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query, it can be inferred that some form of data labeling or annotation would have been necessary to train and evaluate these ML models. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation for object detection tasks, semantic segmentation for pixel-level image classification, and instance segmentation for detecting individual objects within images. However, without further context, it cannot be determined if any of these specific techniques were employed in this study.
