different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

Helpful Answer: The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include several techniques aimed at improving the quality and usability of the input data. These steps often involve data cleaning, where missing values, outliers, or irrelevant data points are removed or corrected. Normalization and scaling are also common preprocessing steps used to ensure that all input features have similar scales, preventing certain features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Other preprocessing methods include encoding categorical variables into numerical representations, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. However, it should be noted that these preprocessing steps depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset being used for training the deep learning model.
