respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information.

2.2.3. Data splitting 

Based on the conceptual model mentioned above, we split the data to 
construct  the  source  and  target  domain  datasets  to  carry  out  transfer 
learning experiments.  For the  ImageNet  dataset, we directly  used the 
pre-trained model on ImageNet-1 k as the source model, so there was no 
need to split the dataset. Both the SS and the LSM dataset are camera 
trap  image  datasets.  Each  time  the  camera  is  triggered,  it  captures 
multiple images in succession, called a capture event. A capture event 
frequently  comprises  three  images.  Notably,  images  within  the  same 
event are significantly similar to each other. Splitting the images in an 
event into training and test sets may lead to poor generalization of the 
DCNN  model. To  prevent  this, we kept  the integrity  of events  during 
data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.

2. Datasets and method 

2.1. Datasets 

This  study  used  three  significantly  different  datasets:  ImageNet, 
Snapshot  Serengeti  (SS),  and  Lasha  Mountain  (LSM).  ImageNet  is  a 
benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. Each image in the 
ImageNet dataset is manually annotated, and the image sizes vary, with 
the largest size being 4288 × 2848 pixels and the smallest being 75 × 56 
pixels. The ImageNet dataset we used is ImageNet-1 k, which contains 
1000 classes and 1.2 million training samples. This study used the pre- 
trained  model  on  the  ImageNet-1  k  dataset  as  one  of  the  source 
models for transfer learning.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the study primarily uses image data. Specifically, the datasets mentioned - ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM) - are all described as containing images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
