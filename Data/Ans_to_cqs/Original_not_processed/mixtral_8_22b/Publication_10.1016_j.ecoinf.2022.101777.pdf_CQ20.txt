Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

Acquiring large-scale training data to train the RF classifier in the 
classification  of  complex  regions  with  a  great  many  categories  is  a 
laborious  task  that  requires  hours  of  processing.  Thus,  in  the  present 
study we assumed that training samples should represent approximately 
0.25% of the total study area used by the RF classifier for large-scale 
classification  (Colditz,  2015;  Deng  and  Wu,  2013;  Du  et  al.,  2015). 
Once these errors in classification have been identified, it is useful to 
carry out work with more training areas that include this category of 
“new  vineyard”,  since  its  spectral signature  after 5 years of  growth is 
totally different from what it looks like in the year of planting. Consid-
ering the study area and the strong influence of the wine sector in it, this 
is an issue that can be improved in future studies.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
