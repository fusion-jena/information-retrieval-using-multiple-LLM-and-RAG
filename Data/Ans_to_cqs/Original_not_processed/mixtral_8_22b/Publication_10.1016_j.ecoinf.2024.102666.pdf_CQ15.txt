artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

algorithms. For instance, Hadjimitsis conducted a comparative study of 
AC algorithms applied to small reservoirs, elucidating the optimal se-
lection  process for sensors and AC techniques in such confined water 
bodies (Hadjimitsis et al., 2004). Similarly, Yi’s research highlights the 
necessity  of  employing  suitable  sensors  and  AC  methods  in  turbid 
coastal  waters.  This  is  essential  for  accurately  retrieving  ocean  color 

products, a task complicated by the optical complexity introduced by 
high turbidity (Yi, 2016).
