2.2. Data sources and pre-processing 

We acquired GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources 
Satellite Data and Application (http://www.cresda.com/CN/) (Table 1). 
The  GF-6  remote  sensing  data  were  preprocessed,  mainly  including 
radiometric  calibration,  atmospheric  correction,  geometric  correction 
and image cropping.

by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.
