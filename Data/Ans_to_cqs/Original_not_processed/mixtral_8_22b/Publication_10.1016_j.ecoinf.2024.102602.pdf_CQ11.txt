collaborative  nature  of  our  approach,  where  the  public  contributes 
through citizen-science and social media platforms, can foster a sense of 
shared responsibility, which usually increases the trust in these methods

2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227Ã—
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen

Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.
