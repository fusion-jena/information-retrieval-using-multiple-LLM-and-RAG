Here, Tε1(x, t) represents the limiting effect of vegetation at low and 
high temperatures, while Tε2(x, t) denotes the ambient temperature to 
which the vegetation is exposed. Wε(x, t) signifies the effect of humidity 
conditions  on  the  use  of  light  energy.  εmax  represents  the  vegetation 
conversion efficiency to APAR under an ideal condition, signifying the 
maximum percentage utilization of the light energy. Parameter εmax  is 
pivotal  for  calculating  light  use  efficiency  in  the  model  and  its  value 
varies  according  to  region  and  vegetation  type.  Huang  et  al.  (2023) 
applied  the  CASA  model  to  estimate  NPP  in  the  ASEAN  region  by 
exploring and adopting locally εmax  value. In this research, we employed 
the εmax  value proposed by Zhu et al. (2007), which is suitable for the 
Chinese region and has been utilized for regional-scale NPP estimation 
(Xiao et al., 2022). The εmax  of each vegetation type used in this research

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model based on the available context.
