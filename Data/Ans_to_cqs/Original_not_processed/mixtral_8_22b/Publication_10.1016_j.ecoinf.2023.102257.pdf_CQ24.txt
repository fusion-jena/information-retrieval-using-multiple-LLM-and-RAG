2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Helpful Answer:
The study does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Instead, it focuses on evaluating the effects of machine learning (ML) model performance on tagging efficiency in wildlife monitoring using trail cameras. The researchers conducted experiments using three tagging methods, one with ML bounding box assistance and two without assistance. They found that ML bounding boxes significantly improved tagging efficiency but were dependent on the ML algorithm's performance. Incorrect ML predictions could slow down the tagging process compared to non-hybrid approaches. Therefore, while this research provides valuable insights into optimizing data labeling processes using ML models, it does not discuss specific strategies for dealing with randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
