3.1. Model accuracy

To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization ability of the model by introducing variations into the input images.

Unhelpful Answer:
The paper uses an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. Four different models were employed, including regression-based and machine-learning models such as Maxent, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Cross-validation was used to test for model performance, with the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve being used as the index to specify the accuracy. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
