Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the

2009).  On  the  other  hand,  new  biases  may  arise  depending  on  the 
specificities of the choice of the feature extraction (Towsey et al., 2012). 
Thus,  as  in  all  fields  of  study  that  are  increasingly  using  automated 
processes,  the  reliability  and  quality  of  the  results  obtained  largely 
depend on the algorithms used (Knight et al., 2017; Marchal et al., 2022; 
Rydell  et  al.,  2017). This  means that  in fields  that largely  depend  on 
algorithmic automatizations, a continuous evaluation of the quality and 
uncertainty of these processes is paramount. For instance, recent studies 
on species distribution models (Munro et al., 2022) and the evaluation of 
rangeland  aboveground  biomass  (Kaveh  et  al.,  2023)  suggest  that 
widely-used  algorithms  do  not  have  the  desired  quality  in  certain 
situations.

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they provide insights into the importance of considering data bias and its impact on the performance of machine learning models.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on the target variable, ensuring that each subset has approximately the same proportion of samples from each class. This technique helps maintain the balance between classes when partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Both methods aim to achieve a balanced dataset, but oversampling can lead to overfitting, while undersampling can result in loss of information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents different populations, reducing the risk of bias. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with underrepresented groups or rare events.

It is essential to note that addressing data bias requires careful consideration of the problem domain and the available resources. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the type of bias present, and the computational requirements. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of each method before applying them to real-world problems.
