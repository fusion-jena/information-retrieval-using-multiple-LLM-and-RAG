4)  Artificial intelligence is increasingly being trialled and deployed to 
detect  and  identify/classify  organisms  in  marine  imagery.  Images 
(and  annotations)  reused  as  training  data  for  the  development  of 
artificial intelligence tools could introduce bias into the identifica-
tions, as performance is related to biological community structure 
(Durden et al., 2021; Orenstein et al., 2020), so the definition of the 
target population used in image capture could be used to identify and 
potentially mitigate against such biases.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that careful planning and documentation throughout the entire process of capturing and processing marine imagery are essential to ensure consistency and reduce potential sources of randomness. This includes defining the target population, outlining the planned spatial and temporal extents, describing the habitat or environment of study, detailing the type of imagery, and documenting the use of ancillary data captured. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of considering potential biases introduced by artificial intelligence tools used for detecting and identifying organisms in marine imagery, which might also relate to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, further information on specific strategies for managing randomness in deep learning pipelines would require additional resources beyond the given context.
