In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

Acknowledgment

These parameters are the number of selected variables in the model, 
the size of the confidence ellipsoid (counter probability), and the cut-off 
threshold value of the distances between the geometrical mean of the 
trails  (Wards-cut-off  distance).  No  hyperparameter  tuning  has  been 
conducted  and  in  order  to  assure  uniformity,  all  models  of  the  same 
species  were  executed  with  the  default  FIT  parameters  on  the  full 
dataset. 

For  the  second experiment, we applied  the same  approach to real 

missing data points. 

In summary, we analyzed 37 FIT runs per species and compared 185 
model outputs in the first experiment and a total of 13 FIT runs for the 
second experiment.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a portion of the dataset for training the model, another portion for validating its performance during the training process, and a final portion for testing the model after training. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. Typically, the dataset is randomly divided into these subsets, often using an 80/20 or 70/30 split for training and testing, respectively, while reserving a smaller subset for validation. Without specific details about the splitting criteria used in this case, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
