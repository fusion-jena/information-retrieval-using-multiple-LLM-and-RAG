Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

All  experiments  were  performed  on  a  personal  computer  with  a 
1060Ti GPU and an Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. Additionally, CUDA 
v10.1 was applied to train the model, which accelerated the processing 
speed; Python version 3.7 was also used. The other libraries used were 
NumPy  (v1.21.2),  PyTorch  (v1.6.0),  Pycocotools,  Cython,  Matplotlib, 
tqdm, yacs, and OpenCV. 

The wild  animals  were tracked  using the  Siamese  network,  which 
updated the connection weights of each network layer by learning the 
features of the training samples. This ensured that the tracking method 
produced  accurate  results(Kang  et  al.,  2019).  In  comparison  with 
traditional training methods, the few-shot learning method can rapidly

The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the
