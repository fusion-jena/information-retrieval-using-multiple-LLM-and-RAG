2.2. Species occurrence records 

Between  2010  and  2022,  a  comprehensive  dataset  was  compiled 
consisting of 200 occurrences of wild goat, 210 occurrences of urial, and 
190 occurrences of jebeer gazelle in the central Iranian plateau. The data 
collection process involved two primary sources to ensure robustness: 
A subset of the dataset (wild goat: n = 100, urial: n = 150, and jebeer 
gazelle: n = 50) was directly observed and documented by the research 
team. The records were collected through on-the-ground observations 
and information provided by park rangers. The remaining portion of the 
dataset (wild goat: n = 100, urial: n = 60, and jebeer gazelle: n = 140)

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. These include direct observation and documentation by the research team, on-the-ground observations, and information provided by park rangers. Additionally, a subset of the dataset is obtained from other sources not explicitly mentioned in the given context. It can be inferred that these methods involve some form of survey or sensor data collection, although specific details about the types of sensors used or the nature of the surveys conducted are not provided. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of using public datasets in this particular study. However, it should be noted that utilizing publicly available datasets is a common practice in many deep learning pipelines, depending on the requirements and objectives of the study.
