BirdVox-DCASE-10 h (BV-Training set): The BV dataset was pro-
duced  as  part  of  the  BirdVox  project  Website  of  the  BirdVox  project: 
WebsiteoftheBirdVoxproject:\url{https://wp.nyu.edu/birdvox},  whose 
goal  is  to  monitor  bird  migration  with  autonomous  recording  units 
(Lostanlen et al., 2018). The recordings were obtained in four locations 
of Tompkins County, NY, US, during the 2015 fall migration season. An 
expert  ornithologist,  Andrew  Farnsworth,  has  annotated  2662  flight 
calls  from  11  species  of  passerines,  e.g.,  Swainson’s  thrush  (Catharus 
ustulatus)  and  White-throated  sparrow  (Zonotrichia  albicollis.  These 
flight  calls  have  a  duration  in  the  range  50–150  milliseconds  and  a 
fundamental frequency in the range 2–10 kHz.

• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models mentioned. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether they were deployed using platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
