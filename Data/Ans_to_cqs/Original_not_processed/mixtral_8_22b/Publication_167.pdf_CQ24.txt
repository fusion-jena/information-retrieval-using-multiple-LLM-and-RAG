Traditional means and algorithms lack the ability to quantitatively analyze the drivers and
mechanisms of LUCC, and the accumulation of massive data over the years provides the possibility of
using deep learning models for related explorations. The probability of the LU distribution can be
determined by a deep learning model. The LU probability cannot determine whether a certain LU
type exists at that time; its function is to determine the distribution probability of a variety of LU types
in a spatial unit, and the probability is the basis for the SM.

Figure 4 introduces the adopted DM. In the DM, the grid with the neighborhood features includes
the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, and all grid
units are input into the DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, ﬁt the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the
SM, and perform further LU simulations.

The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units.

Input Data

In this paper, the input data are 40-dimensional data. Due to the large time span and large land
area in the training data, there are large diﬀerences in the distribution between diﬀerent batches of
training data in the training stage, and there is a certain distribution diﬀerence between the training set
and the test set. Therefore, batch normalization is performed on the input data, where the speciﬁc
calculation/transformation of BatchNorm (Algorithm 1) is shown below. First, the mean of each
channel in the current batch is calculated, and then, the variance of each channel in the current batch is
calculated. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation
to obtain the normalized output ˆχ
i is multiplied by the scale parameter γ, and the shift
parameter β is added to obtain the ﬁnal output yi:

i; then, ˆχ

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions that due to the large time span and large land area in the training data, there are significant differences in the distribution between different batches of training data during the training phase. To address these discrepancies, the authors employ batch normalization on the input data. This technique involves calculating the mean and variance of each channel within the current batch, subtracting the mean from the input, dividing the result by the standard deviation, multiplying the outcome by a scale parameter, and adding a shift parameter to produce the final output. While this approach doesn't directly tackle randomness caused by elements like random seed values, it helps manage variability in the dataset, which could indirectly mitigate some effects of randomness in the deep learning process.
