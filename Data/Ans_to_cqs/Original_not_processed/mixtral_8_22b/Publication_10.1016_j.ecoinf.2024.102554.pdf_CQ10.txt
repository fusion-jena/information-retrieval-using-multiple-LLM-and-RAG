Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not contain information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that there are operational intricacies of different tools used in the process, which can be found in the repository's README.md file. This suggests that the code repository might be available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the exact link, one would need additional information or search for relevant repositories created by J.G. Gim´enez et al. or related organizations mentioned in the context, such as ESA or NASA.
