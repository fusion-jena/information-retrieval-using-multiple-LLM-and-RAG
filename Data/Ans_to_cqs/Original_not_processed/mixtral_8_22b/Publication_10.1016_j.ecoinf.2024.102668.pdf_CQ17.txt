3.  Differences gains among recording devices: The signal amplitude of a 
microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone may 
capture. This depends on the manufacturing materials and its level of 
degradation.  Significant  differences  in  gain  are  expected  from  mi-
crophones of different brands or after severe outdoor use. 

2.3. Proposed preprocessing approach 

Fig. 2 shows the proposed preprocessing methodology to tackle the 

abovementioned issues. It consists of three steps:

bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust. L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as penalty term to the loss function, while L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of the coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. Both L1 and L2 regularizations help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the weights of the network. Other techniques such as early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization can also be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.
