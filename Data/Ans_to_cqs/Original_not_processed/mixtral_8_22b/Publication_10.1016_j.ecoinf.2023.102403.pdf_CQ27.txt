Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain any specific details about a deployed deep learning model or its deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. It would require additional information regarding the training and deployment of such a model.
