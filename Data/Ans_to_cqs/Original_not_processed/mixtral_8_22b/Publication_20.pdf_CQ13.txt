A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

3.2. Performance of CNN models vs. humans

On average, each human identiﬁed 270 ﬁsh thumbnails during the
20-min test. Mean rate of correct classiﬁcation for humans was of
89.3% with a standard deviation of 6% (Table 4). Rate of correct
classiﬁcation achieved by the best model on the same thumbnails was
of 94.9% with a standard deviation of 3.3%. Correct classiﬁcation rate
by the best model ranged from 88.2% (Abudefduf sparoides) to 98.2%
(Abudefduf vaigiensis). For only one species (Zanclus cornutus), the best
model had a lower performance than humans but both were higher than
97%. The mean time needed to identify a ﬁsh by humans was 5 s, with

We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model used a learning rate of 10^-5 with an exponential learning decay and a gamma of 0.95. A dropout of 50% was applied, and the Adam solver type was used as the learning parameter. These hyperparameters were chosen for their ability to facilitate fast convergence of the network without causing overfitting. The model was trained using thumbnails of whole fish, parts of fish species, and environment. The raw outputs were post-processed using two decision rules: (r1) keeping the most likely fish class if "environment" was the most likely class, and (r2) considering "part of species X" equivalent to "species X." The model was trained using a GoogLeNet architecture, which won the 2015 ImageNet competition, an identification challenge on 1000 different classes.
