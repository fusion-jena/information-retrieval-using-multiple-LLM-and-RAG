Access  to  required  computing  resources  is  another  challenge. 
Training  deep  neural  networks  for  semantic  segmentation  and  object 
detection traditionally requires expensive computational resources with 
multiple high-end GPUs (e.g., available on high-performance computing

Python 3.8.0 (Van Rossum and Drake, 2009) and Jupyter Notebook 
v6.4.5 (Jupyter Team, 2015) were used for image processing on a per-
sonal laptop. U-Net training was carried out on the high-performance

computing  resources  Consortium  des 
(C´ECI)  using  the  Dragon  2  cluster  hosted  at  the  University  of  Mons, 
Belgium. The specific cluster node used for the training consisted of the 
following hardware configuration –  Intel Skylake 12-cores Xeon 6126 
processor at 2.6 GHz with a Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (5120 CUDA core/ 
16GB HBM2/7.5 TFlops double precision). 

2.3.2. Object detection model for localization of large animals 

To  identify  individual  animals  in  images  an  object  detection 
approach  was  used.  The  open-source  DEtection  TRansformer  (DETR)

DETR  training  was  performed  on  a  Personal  Computer  running 
Ubuntu 18.04–28-core Intel i9-7940× CPU, 125 GB RAM and 2 NVIDIA 
GeForce  RTX  2080Ti  graphics  cards.  See  the  supplementary  text  for 
comprehensive  information  regarding  the  U-Net  (S1)  and  DETR  (S2) 
models,  including  model  architecture,  training  procedures,  impact  of 
adding DBSCAN to DETR predictions and labelling methods. The scripts 
and ground-truth data necessary to run both the semantic segmentation 
and object detection deep learning models are openly available at htt
