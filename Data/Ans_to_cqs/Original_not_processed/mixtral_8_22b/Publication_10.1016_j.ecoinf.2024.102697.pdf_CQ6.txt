2.5. Machine learning methods

the  primary  hyperparameters  required  for  application  of  the  random 
forest method. Here, hyperparameter optimization was performed using 
Bayesian  Optimization  to  minimize  a  5  k-fold  cross-validation  loss 
during model development (Section 2.7).

2.7. Machine learning training methodology 

To ensure accuracy and reliability of results, a repeated nested k-fold 
cross-validation approach was employed for all ML models developed 
here. An outer 10 k-fold cross-validation provided an initial division of 
the data into holdout data and data for model development (Molinaro 
et al., 2005). An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation was then used to mini-
mize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results, as 
demonstrated in previous studies (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Yates et al., 
2022).  The  training  performance  was  calculated  based  on  the  inner 
cross-validated  ensemble,  while  the  testing  performance  was  deter-
mined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire 
training set to predict on the holdout data. This process was repeated 15 
times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance 
related to random sampling (Kim, 2009).

In  the  subsequent  sections,  we  assess  model  performance  in  the 
context of model complexity and explainability, crop specific training 
against  generalized  training,  and  contrast  remote  sensing  and  meteo-
rological measurements to provide predictive performance for several 
potential use cases. 

3.1. Model complexity 

The management of model complexity is an important consideration 
in  data-driven  model  development (Jolliffe,  1986; Wang  et  al.,  2017; 
Yates  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  study  we  define  model  complexity  as  the 
number of variables included in the predictor set. Proper selection of 
variables, i.e. feature selection, can minimize training costs, measure-
ment  requirements,  and  decrease  the  likelihood  of  overfitting  (Banks 
and Fienberg, 2003; Cawley and Talbot, 2010).

Helpful Answer:
Although the given context does not directly discuss the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it does mention some relevant concepts related to machine learning model development. However, these concepts can also be applied to deep learning models.

Before training any machine learning or deep learning model, including those mentioned in the context such as Random Forests, it is essential to perform various preprocessing steps on the dataset. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, outliers, or irrelevant information from the dataset.
2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Transforming features so they have zero mean and unit variance or fall within a certain range (e.g., between 0 and 1), which helps improve convergence during gradient descent.
3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical form, e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

While the context focuses more on hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation techniques like Bayesian Optimization and nested k-fold cross-validation, these processes occur after preprocessing steps have been completed. It is crucial to note that proper preprocessing ensures better model performance and prevents issues like overfitting or underfitting.
