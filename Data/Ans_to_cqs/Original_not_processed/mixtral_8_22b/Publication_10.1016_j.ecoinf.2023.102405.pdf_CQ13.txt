Ex derivative of the hidden state ht with respect to time t. The specific 
form of the ODE function  ODE(ht, t) depends  on the problem and the 
design of the model. It captures the continuous dynamics of the hidden 
state over time. 

∂ht/∂t = ODE(ht, t)

Theorem 4. Prove that at = softmax(va⋅ht) the attention scores for each 
time step. By using the weight vector va and the hidden state ht to calculate the 
raw scores, which are then normalized using the softmax activation function 
to  obtain  a  probability  distribution  over  the  time  steps.  {ht = (1 (cid:0) zt) ⊙
ht(cid:0) 1 + zt ⊙ ht}. 

Proof: 
Element-wise multiplication: 

zt mult = zt ⊙ h′

t 

Element-wise multiplication: 

(1 (cid:0) zt mult) = (1 (cid:0) zt) ⊙ ht(cid:0) 1 

Element-wise addition: 

ht = (1 (cid:0) zt) ⊙ ht(cid:0) 1 + zt mult

Furthermore, Chou et al. (2018) demonstrated a machine learning 
method for evaluating the water quality in reservoirs, highlighting the 
ANNs model's accuracy while expressing worries about its scalability. 
Our study presents a customized paradigm for water pollution analysis 
in aquaculture, building on previous efforts. The AODEGRU model of-
fers increased accuracy and efficiency while addressing scaling issues. 
The  use  of  deep  learning  models  for  classifying  water  pollution  in 
aquaculture is still developing, despite its potential in several domains 
(Arepalli and Naik, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c; Zhang et al., 2021; Haq and 
Harigovindan,  2022).  Current  deep  learning  models  face  difficulties 
including inconsistent data, interpretability constraints, and poor per-
formance in this setting. To address this, we provide a novel attention 
based AODEGRU model in our study, which deviates greatly from pre-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model being discussed is an AODEGRU model. However, the exact hyperparameters used in this model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Typically, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam or SGD), number of layers, number of units in each layer, dropout rate, batch size, and others depending on the specific architecture and requirements of the task. In order to determine the exact hyperparameters used in this particular AODEGRU model, additional information would be needed.
