these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

Second, we proposed data augmentation to train the EfficientNet as a 
classifier. The basic concept of this procedure was the same as that in the 
data  extension  for  YOLO,  where  we  combined  a  masked  foreground 
image  with  a  background  image  that  did  not  contain  any  insects.  At 
most,  one  foreground  image  was  composited.  For  the  foreground, 
background, and combined images, the same image processing as the 
data augmentation for YOLOv4 was applied. For the data augmentation 
employed  to  train  the  EfficientNet,  the  parameters  are  shown  in 
Table 1b. Fig. 4 shows an example of data augmentation for the second 
stage of the proposed augmentation method.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that data augmentation is employed to prepare the training dataset for the EfficientNet model. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying various transformations to existing ones, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc. This technique helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the model. Additionally, the text states that the dropout rate for each task was set at 0.5, which is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting. It can be inferred that these techniques serve as preprocessing steps before training the deep learning model.
