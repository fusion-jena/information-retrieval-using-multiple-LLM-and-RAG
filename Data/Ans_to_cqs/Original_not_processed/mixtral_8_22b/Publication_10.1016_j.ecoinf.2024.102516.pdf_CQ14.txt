2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

To measure, how well our employed models can predict the species 
compositions, we utilize several metrics to shed light on different aspects 
of the models’ predictions. For the analysis of the size of the species-wise 
error, we utilize the mean scaled absolute error with standard deviation 
as scale value (MSAEσ), which we define as 

MSAEσ(t, p) =

where t and p are the vectors of true and predicted values, respectively, 
and σ represents the species-wise standard deviations over the complete 
dataset. Due to the large imbalance in the plant cover values, even in 
single images, this metric relativizes the disproportions by relating the 
values  to  the  respective  species-wise  standard  deviations.  In  the 
following, for simplicity, this metric will be referred to as MSAE.

the standard softmax cross entropy loss (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

We utilize these metrics to compare the different model setups and
