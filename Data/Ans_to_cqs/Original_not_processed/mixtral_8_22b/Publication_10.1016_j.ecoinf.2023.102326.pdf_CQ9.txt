Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

located in urban forests (AAD20 and 24). It can be assumed that these 
matches are also due to the high percentage of forest vegetation and the 
low percentage of built-up area around those sites.

2. Data 

2.1. Audio data 

For our work, we use data from the SALVE study. Briefly, 50 3-min 
audio files have been recorded daily at 84 locations in Bochum since 
2019.  Meanwhile,  data  is  available  over  a  period  of  more  than  three 
years. Here, we use a subset from 23 different locations from May 2019 
to  the  end  of  February  2020  (defined  in  Haselhoff  et  al.  (2022c)  as 
AAP24).  The  choice  of  the  endpoint  is  motivated  by  excluding  the 
changes  to  the  AE  caused  by  the  corona  pandemic  (Hornberg  et  al., 
2021). Recordings were made using Wildlife Acoustics SM4 recorders with 
a  SMMA2  microphone  (Wildlife  Acoustics,  2020).  The  devices  were 
mounted  at  a  height  of  approx.  1.65  m  (DIN  ISO  12913-1:2018-02, 
2023) and programmed to record 3-min recordings every 26 min at a 
sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz and 16 bit depth.

In this work, we (i) describe all necessary steps of how CNs can be 
constructed from large-scale acoustic data and (ii) evaluate this process 
on approx. one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different 
sites  in  Bochum,  Germany.  Here,  the  foundation  for  constructing

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository is located based on the provided text alone. Further resources or references would need to be consulted to find out about the specific location of the data repository.
