Our study leverages ML for multi-layer classification to accurately 
identify  areas  affected  by  wildfires.  Given  the  critical  importance  of 
precision in wildfire mapping, we evaluated our model’s performance 
using two primary metrics, OA and Cohen’s Kappa statistic, which are 
vital for understanding the model’s effectiveness. 

OA  is  the  proportion  of  correctly  predicted  instances  (wildfire- 
affected  and  unaffected  areas)  out  of  the  total  instances  evaluated. 
Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

combination within the grid is identified and ensuring search precision. 
This  deterministic  approach  is  invaluable  when  the  hyperparameter 
space is relatively more constrained and well-defined, and exhaustive 
exploration is computationally feasible. The rationale behind applying 
this hierarchical approach is to amalgamate the benefits of both methods 
to  achieve  an  optimal  balance  between  computational  efficiency  and 
search precision (Table 2). The model exhibits exemplary performance 
by utilizing a dataset composed of 235 predictors and 5000 data points 
randomly split into 3000 for training and 2000 for validation (a 60/40 
ratio).  Precisely,  it  attains  a  flawless  training  accuracy  of  1.0.  Mean-
while, the model demonstrates a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the 
validation dataset. Furthermore, upon optimizing the hyperparameters 
of the RF model, we meticulously evaluated the model’s performance

exclusively use the dNBR model in this study to create a comprehensive 
training dataset through a systematic three-step process.

using  various  metrics,  including  the  Mean  Squared  Error  (MSE), 
confusion matrix, and the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error rate (Daviran et al., 
2021). These evaluations were carried out on the training and validation 
datasets to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the model’s pre-
dictive  accuracy  and  generalization  capabilities.  The  MSE  for  the 
training dataset was observed to be 0.0, indicating an exact match be-
tween the model predictions and the observed data. For the validation 
dataset, the MSE was 0.076, reflecting the average squared difference 
between  the  predicted  and  actual  values.  An  important  metric  in  RF 
models, the OOB error rate, was calculated to be 0.082. The OOB error 
rate serves as an unbiased estimate of the prediction error for unseen 
data. A lower OOB error rate suggests that the model has good gener-
alization ability, which is crucial for ensuring the model’s applicability

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum threshold for accuracy or a maximum threshold for loss), or observing no significant improvement in validation performance over several epochs or iterations (i.e., a validation loss plateau). In this case, since the Random Forest model achieves a perfect training accuracy of 1.0 and a validation accuracy of 0.924, it could be assumed that the training was stopped after achieving satisfactory performance on the validation set. Additionally, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the training dataset being 0.0 indicates an exact match between the model predictions and the observed data, further suggesting that the training might have been considered complete once such a high level of accuracy was achieved.
