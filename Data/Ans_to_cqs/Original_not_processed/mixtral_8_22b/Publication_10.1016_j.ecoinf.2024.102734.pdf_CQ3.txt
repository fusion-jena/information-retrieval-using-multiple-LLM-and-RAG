query set are negative. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) propose transductive
propagation that iteratively propagates labels from labelled instances to
unlabelled instances according to the graph structure of the embeddings.
Other semi-supervised learning techniques have been applied such as
active learning. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2022) combines a few-shot

We compare three classification models - ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016),
Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) and HuBERT
(Hsu et al., 2021). The classification models compared in Section 4.1
were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments automatically
generated by the annotator. The dataset includes 1130 possum vocal-
isations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset has an 80/20% training-
validation split which is used to evaluate model performance during
training. Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the
recommendation outlined by the model authors. Each segment has been
manually reviewed by a human. 500 segments are separated into a test
set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The
distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of
the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset
performance are reported. Using the test dataset we evaluate the model

The results in Fig. 9 demonstrate the efficacy of active learning using
low-certainty sampling as implemented in the audio annotation meth-
odology. Active learning (low-certainty) achieved 90% test accuracy
using 20 training samples compared to random sampling which required
80 samples to reach 90% test accuracy. Active learning using high-
certainty samples performed the worst and failed to converge within
the first epoch. Active learning using low-certainty samples resulted in
improved training efficiency.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of manual review or verification was conducted on each segment of the dataset, as mentioned in the statement "Each segment has been manually reviewed by a human." This suggests that human input was involved in the annotation process. Additionally, the paper titled "How to Annotate 100 Hours in 45 Minutes" might provide insights into the annotation techniques used, but without access to this source, it cannot be confirmed. Therefore, while it is clear that manual review was part of the annotation process, the specific techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
