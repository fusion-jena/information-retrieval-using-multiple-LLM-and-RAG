The concept of SOWCEM focused on mitigating the biases of indi-
vidual prediction methods by effectively combining multiple predictive
models or synthesizing multiple factors. This achieves optimal spatio-
temporal adaptive weighted combination prediction, generating
Sentinel-2 NDVI regular dense-time-series data with a high spatiotem-
poral resolution. This enhances the reliability, stability, and accuracy of
the algorithm. A crucial aspect of composite prediction is determining
the weights of each individual prediction method. When n different
prediction models are employed for remote sensing image prediction
and reconstruction, the composite prediction model formed by these n
individual models is as follows:

zt,(x,y) =

∑n

i=1

ωi × zi,(x,y), i = 1, 2, …, n

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The context mentions that deep learning is applied for improving NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover studies, but does not provide details about the architecture of the deep learning model being utilized. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model is implemented in this particular scenario.
