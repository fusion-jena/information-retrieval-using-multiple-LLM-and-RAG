The objective function and expected function are denoted by U(D, G) 
and E. D and G presents the discriminator and generator networks. D(x) 
calculates the likelihood that x is the true data (i.e., real data) that is 
based  on  training  reference  samples.  In  the  3D  GAN  network,  we 
employed a conditional map unit to produce synthetic samples from a 
random  noise  vector,  like  the  Generative  Adversarial  Minority  Over-
sampling (GAMO) (Subhra Mullick et al., 2019) and 3D-HyperGAMO (S. 
K.  Roy  et  al.,  2021),  only  for  classes  with  a  low  number  of  training 
samples.  The  benefit  of  such  a  methodology  is  that  it  eliminates  the 
problem of imbalanced data, which is typical in wetland mapping. In 
particular, in the 3D GAN model, the 3D patch generator uses seven (c (cid:0)
1, c presents the number of classes) units, one unit for each of the classes 
g samples (see 
with minor ground-truth data. Thus, the unit Ui generates γi
Eq. 2).

3.6. Cost of computation in terms of time 

The hardware configurations for the experiments in this study con-
sisted of Intel Core i7-10750H 2.60 GHz CPU, GeForce RTX 2070-MaxQ 
GPU, and 16GB RAM. As seen in Table 5, the Swin Transformer classifier 
had  the  least  cost  in  terms  of  time,  with  approximately  1.5  h  of  its 
required training time, while the CoAtNet algorithm required about 5 h 
for its training. The proposed 3DUNetGSFormer required around 3.5 h 
for its training time. 

4. Discussion 

Understanding  dynamic land  cover changes  in wetland-dominated 
regions such as Canada requires accurate mapping of diverse and com-
plex  wetland  ecosystems.  Up-to-date  maps  showing  wetlands’  extent 
and  spatial  pattern  are  critical  for  protecting  and  conserving  these 
important  ecosystems.  The  rapid  evolution  of  free  access  and  high

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on presenting the results of various models, including ViT, ST, CoAtNet, CNN + ST, GAN + ST, and 3DUNetGSFormer, without delving into their respective hyperparameter settings. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.
