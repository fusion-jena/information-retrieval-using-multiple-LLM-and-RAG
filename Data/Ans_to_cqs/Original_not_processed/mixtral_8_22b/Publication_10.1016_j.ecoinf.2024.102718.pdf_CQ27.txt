For our experimental setup of training the BEiT model, we employed
an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti GPU coupled with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU
and 32 GB of RAM to ensure robust processing capabilities necessary for
handling large datasets and complex model architectures. Our model is
developed using TensorFlow within a Jupyter Notebook environment,
facilitating an interactive setup that supports real-time adjustments and
visual feedback. Each image is standardized to 224 × 224 pixels for
training and subjected to various data augmentation techniques like
random rotations and color adjustments to enhance model robustness.
The training parameters mainly consist of using the Adam optimizer
(cid:0) 5 and adopting categorical cross-entropy
with a learning rate of 1 × 10
as the loss function, specifically designed for optimizing multi-class
classification tasks. To improve the effectiveness of training and the

Training time is another critical factor for practical IoT device
deployment. The BEiT model achieves competitive efficiency with a
training time of 1 min and 10 s for the PlantVillage Dataset. Although
Farian et al.’s model has a slightly shorter training time of 1 min and 6 s,
it does not match the BEiT model’s overall performance, making the
BEiT model a more balanced option for both speed and accuracy.On the
whole, the proposed BEiT model’s more effective accuracy, precision,
recall, F1-score, and AUC, coupled with efficient training time, highlight
its potential for real-world applications in smart agriculture, particularly
in handling the complexities of plant disease classification.

8. Challenges and limitations

In the BEiT model architecture, our initial steps involve loading the
BEiT model and strategically freezing a substantial portion of its layers
approximately 7 of the total layers. By doing so, the model freezes the
weights in these layers, focusing the training process on fine-tuning the
remaining layers. The model is then derived by isolating the output of a
specific layer (‘out_ln’) from the BEiT architecture. To enhance training

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model in the given context. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format suitable for use in other environments. This could include saving the model weights, architecture, and any additional metadata required to recreate the model. Common formats used for this purpose might include HDF5, pickle files, or specific framework-dependent formats like TensorFlow SavedModel or PyTorch checkpoints.

Once the model is saved, it can be deployed onto a platform appropriate for the intended application. For instance, if the goal is to create a web service around the model, platforms like Flask or Django could be used to build a REST API. Alternatively, if the aim is to integrate the model into an existing system, the model could be loaded directly into that system. In some cases, specialized hardware may also be used for deployment, such as edge devices or dedicated AI accelerators.

However, without further details regarding the specific project requirements and constraints, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer about which approach would be most suitable for deploying the trained deep learning model described in the context.
