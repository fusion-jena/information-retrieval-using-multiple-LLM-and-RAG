From Table 11, the correct prediction rate for “present” was 76.84%, 
the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 77.55%, and the 
overall  validation  accuracy  was  76.17%.  The  results  showed  that  the 
accuracy  of  the  model  in  predicting  the  “present”  sample  points  was 
>70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%. The 
model  was  effective,  and  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  model  was 
slightly  greater  than  that  of  the  model  based  on  remote  sensing  data 
without the introduction of nighttime light information.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling to maintain class balance. Typically, datasets are divided into three parts: training set (around 60-80%), validation set (around 10-20%), and testing set (around 10-20%) depending on the size of the dataset and specific requirements of the project.
