into four classes with different susceptibility classes, namely low, me-
dium,  high,  and  extreme,  using  Jenks'  natural  break  classification 
method  in  ArcGIS  10.6.  The  Jenks  Natural  Breaks  categorization  (or 
optimization) system is a data categorization methodology that aims to 
maximize  the  organization  of  a  given  set  of  values  into  distinct  and 
meaningful classes. A natural class refers to the class range considered 
the  most  ideal  and  is  observed  to  occur  “naturally”  within  a  given 
dataset. A class interval consists of elements exhibiting comparable at-
tributes, constituting an inherent grouping within a given dataset. The 
approach  employed  in  this  study  is  to  minimize  the  variance  within 
classes  while  simultaneously  maximizing  the  variance  across  types 
(Jenks, 1967; Liu and Duan, 2018). Numerous studies have employed 
natural break (Jenks) and quantile approaches to classify fire risk maps

in satellite images (Al-hasn and Almuhammad, 2022; Atun et al., 2020; 
Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for creating fire risk maps using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. However, common criteria used in machine learning models include reaching a minimum threshold for validation loss or accuracy, achieving a stable performance over several epochs, or observing no further improvement in model performance after a certain number of iterations. In this case, it can be assumed that similar criteria were applied during the creation of the fire risk maps.

Based on the table provided, it appears that the authors used various parameters from Landsat 8 satellite images, including sensor type, path/row, acquisition date, cloud cover percentage, band name, central wavelength, and spatial resolution. These parameters likely played a role in determining the quality and suitability of the images for use in creating fire risk maps. Additionally, the authors mention performing atmospheric correction on the images before proceeding with their analysis, which suggests that they took steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their results.

Overall, while the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the authors followed best practices for ensuring the validity and robustness of their fire risk map creation process.
