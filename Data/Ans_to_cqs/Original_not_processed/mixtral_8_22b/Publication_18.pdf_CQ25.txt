Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images.  Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to 
make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing 
sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to 
extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the 
supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled 
samples.

CNNs constitute the state-of-the art in all the fundamental tasks in computer vision, e.g., in image classifica-
tion and object detection in images. In image classification, the CNN model has to analyze the input image and 
produce a label that describes its visual content, together with a probability that expresses the confidence of the 
model. In object detection, the CNN detection model has not only to produce the correct label but also determine 
by means of a bounding box the region in the input image where the target object is located. Examples of the most 
accurate and robust models for image classification are Inception41 and Inception ResNet42. The most accurate 
detection frameworks are end-to-end object detection models that combine a sophisticated detection technique 
with one of the most powerful CNN classification models. At present, there exist several detection frameworks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural networks capable of extracting spatial 
patterns from images. Their architecture is built by staking three main types of layers: (1) convolutional layer, 
which is used to extract features at different levels of the hierarchy, (2) pooling layer, which is essentially a reduc-
tion operation used to increase the abstraction level of the extracted features and (3) fully connected layer, which 
is used as a classifier at the end of the pipeline.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of a deep learning model can vary depending on the specific task it is designed for. However, based on the given context, we can discuss two common purposes of deep learning models in the field of computer vision: image classification and object detection.

In image classification, the purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is to analyze an input image and produce a label that accurately describes its visual content. This label could be anything relevant to the image, such as identifying whether an image contains a dog or a cat. Alongside the label, the model also provides a probability score indicating the confidence level of the prediction.

On the other hand, in object detection, the goal of the deep learning model is more complex. Not only does it have to correctly identify the objects within an image, but it must also locate them by drawing bounding boxes around each detected object. This allows the model to pinpoint the exact position of multiple objects within a single image. Some popular and highly accurate object detection frameworks include end-to-end models that integrate advanced detection techniques with powerful CNN classification models.
