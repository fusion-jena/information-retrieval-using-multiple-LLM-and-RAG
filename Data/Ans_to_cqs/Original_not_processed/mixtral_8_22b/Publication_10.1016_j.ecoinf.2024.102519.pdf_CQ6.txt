related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area

GA, as a type of swarm intelligence algorithm, imitates the evolu-
tionary  laws  of  “natural  selection  and  survival  of  the  fittest”  in  the 
biological  world  and  utilizes  three  basic  operators,  namely  selection, 
crossover, and mutation, to make the next generation of the population 
more adapted to the environment than the previous generation (Holland 
et al., 1975). The final iteration produces the last-generation population, 
which is the optimal individual decodes as an approximate optimal so-
lution  to  the  target  problem.  This  method  has  the  characteristics  of 
excellent  convergence  and  robustness  and  has  obvious  advantages  in 
solving global optimization problems (Zhang and Gao, 2022). In recent 
years,  the  application  of  GA  has  gradually  penetrated  various  fields, 
including the identification and optimization of ecological nodes (Zhao 
et al., 2020), function optimization (Song et al., 2019), combinatorial

GA was first proposed by John Holland in the United States in the 
1970s  (Holland  et  al.,  1975).  It  is  an  iterative  adaptive  probabilistic 
search  method  based  on  the natural  selection  principle  and a  natural 
genetic  mechanism  that  simulates  the  development  law  of  biological 
evolution in nature (Deng et al., 2023). The optimization process begins 
with a set of random solutions, also known as a “population.” Each in-
dividual in the population is a solution, and the quality of the individual 
solution  is  determined  by  the  fitness  function’s  evaluation  of  the 
“fitness.” Individuals with high fitness have strong adaptability and high 
survival  probability.  The  parent  generates  the  offspring  population 
through GA operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, and 
the global optimal solution is found through repeated iterations.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the data is suitable for input into the model. These steps can include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if there are null values in certain features, they may need to be filled in using techniques like mean imputation or regression imputation.

2. Feature Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when all input features are on a similar scale. Therefore, it is common practice to standardize or normalize feature values. Standardization scales features to have zero mean and unit variance, while normalization scales them between 0 and 1.

3. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization performance of the model, synthetic examples can be generated from existing ones. Common augmentation techniques include rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, and adding noise.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, these must be converted into numerical form before being fed into the model. One popular encoding technique is one-hot encoding, which creates binary vectors for each category level.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. Typically, around 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
