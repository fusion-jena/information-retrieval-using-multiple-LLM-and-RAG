resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

research center. The Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in 
Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

spatial  resolution  photos  can  offer  dependable  data  for  monitoring 
carbon  dynamics. A new  worldwide  study combined ground  observa-
tions and remote sensing data to create a detailed picture of greenhouse 
gas emissions and removals associated with forests from 2001 to 2019 at 
a high spatial resolution of 30 m (Harris et al., 2021). Cloud computing 
advancements  have  led  to  the  development  of  Google  Earth  Engine 
(GEE), providing a platform for analyzing large amounts of satellite data 
throughout time and space. This platform is extensively used for flood 
analysis, land use monitoring, land cover change, and fire monitoring 
(Goparaju  et  al.,  2023;  He  et  al.,  2022).  It  offers  advanced  APIs  and 
programming tools for researchers to include data based on their study 
needs. Prasai et al. (Prasai et al., 2021) utilized the GEE Python API tool 
for  high-accuracy  classification  of  the  2017  NAIP  aerial  imagery,
