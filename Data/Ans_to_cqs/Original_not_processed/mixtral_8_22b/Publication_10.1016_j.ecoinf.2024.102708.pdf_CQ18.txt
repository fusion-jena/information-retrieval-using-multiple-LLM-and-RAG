As three of our models are based on the YOLO structure, we would 
expect the results to be relatively similar, and the results demonstrate 
the success on small training data quantities compared to larger model 
complexity. Intuitively, it would be expected that a smaller model can 
successfully learn from fewer data to represent less complex problems, 
whereas larger more complex models may require more data to repre-
sent more complexity within the object to detect. The results indicated 
that YOLOv5s, as the smallest model, performs best in terms of preci-
sion. The TPH-YOLOv5, which is an extension of the YOLOv5s model is a 
slightly more complex model, and further pre-training on RPAS specific 
imagery. The results indicated that detection of Pacific oysters does not 
demand  the  complexity  of  the  larger  YOLOv5m  model  and  using  the 
TPH-YOLOv5 model pre-trained with RPAS data, is not beneficial in this 
instance.

3. Results 

The  results  are  presented  in  Table  2,  which  shows  the  evaluation 
scores for each model using the data from both sites combined as well as 
split  into  the  two  different  evaluation  sites  with  the  different  back-
grounds  of  rocky  shore  and  mudflats  respectively.  For  each  case,  the 
models  that  return  the  higher  number  of  true  positives,  the  lower 
number  of  false  negatives  and  those  that  score  best  on  precision  and 
recall, are highlighted in bold. 

The results show YOLOv5s model performs best in both site, with 
precision scores of ≈ 88 (cid:0) 89%. On the mudflats site, both YOLOv5s and 
TPH-YOLOv5 are almost exactly matched for precision scores (with a 
difference in precision below 0.05%) though YOLOv5s shows a higher 
recall (80% vs 68%). If the recall is prioritised over precision, then the 
FRCNN model performs best across all sites. For YOLO models, results

Recall = TP

TP + FN

Ground Truth 

The  uncertainties  of  precision  and  recall  for  each  model  are  also 
estimated by calculating the Confidence Interval (CI) for each metric as: 

CI = (Metric) ± z × SEmetric  

where z is the z-score that corresponds to z ≈ 1.96 for a 95% confidence 
assuming a normal distribution and the Standard Error (SE) defined as: 

SEPrecision =

√

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
Precision × (1 (cid:0) Precision)
Number Detected

and 

SERecall =

√

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
Recall × (1 (cid:0) Recall)
Ground Truth

Furthermore, in order to establish the balance between the precision 
and recall of each model, the F-score is also calculated as the harmonic 
mean of precision and recall uncertainty of the model: 
F-score = 2 × Precision × Recall
Precision + Recall

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, some insights about the model performance can still be derived from the available data.

From the table, we see that the metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score have been computed for various models like FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5m. These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of these models in identifying objects accurately. Additionally, the standard errors and confidence intervals for precision and recall provide insight into the variability and reliability of the model predictions.

Moreover, the text mentions that the results indicate that YOLOv5s, being the smallest model, performs best in terms of precision. This suggests that monitoring the performance of the models during training might involve comparing their precision values and selecting the one with the highest value.

However, without direct evidence or explanation regarding the strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training, it cannot be definitively stated what approach was taken.
