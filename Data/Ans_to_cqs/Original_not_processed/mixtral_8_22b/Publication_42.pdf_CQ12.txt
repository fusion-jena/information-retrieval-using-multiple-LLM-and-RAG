7,047,754 learnable parameters gave a F1-score of 84.93% which is even lower. CNN
architectures with many parameters (more than 20,000,000) such as ResNetV50 [38] and
InceptionNetV3 [39] gave a high training accuracy, but a lower validation F1-score of 69.1%
and 81.7%, respectively. This result indicates overﬁtting and that more training data are
needed when such large deep learning networks are used. A very high F1-score of 96.6%
was ﬁnally achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only
training the output layers. This indicates that the state-of-the-art was able to outperform
our proposed model, but requires pretrained weights with many more parameters.

2.2.4. Summary Statistics

The chosen model shown in Figure 5 had an F1-score of 92.75%, which indicated that
the trained CNN was very accurate in its predictions. This ﬁnal architecture was chosen
because it achieved average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, which indicated a
suitable model classiﬁcation.

Finally, the customized CNN architectures were compared with selected state-of-
the-art CNN optimized architectures. EfﬁcientNetB0 [36] is scaled to work with a small
image input size of 224 × 224 pixel and has 4,030,358 learnable parameters. Using the
moths dataset with the same data augmentation, the EfﬁcientNetB0 achieved a F1-score
of 88.62%, which is lower than our top ﬁve best architectures. DenceNet121 [37] with

Helpful Answer:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This can be determined from various parts of the given text, including the mention of CNN architectures, hyperparameters specific to CNN models, and comparisons made between different CNN models like ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3. Additionally, the table presented lists the hyperparameters for CNN architectures, further confirming that a CNN model is being utilized.
