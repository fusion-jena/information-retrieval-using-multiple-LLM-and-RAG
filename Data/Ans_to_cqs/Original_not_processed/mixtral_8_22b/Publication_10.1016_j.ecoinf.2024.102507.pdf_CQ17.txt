With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

layer. 

For VGG19, ResNet50, or a combination of VGG19 and ResNet50, 
we configured the models with Input(shape = (64, 64, band_num)), 
set weights to None, and specified ‘include top’ as False. To create a 
combination model (VGG19 + ResNet50), we used Concatenate() to 
merge the features from VGG19 and ResNet50. The results (Tables 7, 
8,  and  9)  below  demonstrate  the  effects  of  various  parameter

as high-level semantics, which is essential for tasks such as image clas-
sification,  object  detection,  and  segmentation.  The  flexibility  of  deep 
learning  models,  particularly  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs), 
allows customization across diverse image tasks, from classification to 
style  transfer.  Deep  learning  has  consistently  delivered  unparalleled 
performance,  with  models  such  as  ResNet  and  Faster  R-CNN  setting 
benchmarks in their respective fields. The scalability of these models, 
contingent on available data and computational power, is particularly 
valuable for extensive image datasets. Transfer learning offers a critical 
advantage; models pre-trained on vast datasets, such as ImageNet, can 
be repurposed, enhancing their performance on tasks with limited data. 
Many current studies have proven the ability and effectiveness of CNN to 
distinguish specific tree species in forests using RGB images or hyper-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is Dropout. In the context, it is mentioned that the deep learning model includes Dropout layers with a certain Dropout Rate. These Dropout layers help in preventing overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training, thus reducing the co-dependency among them. Although other regularization techniques like L2 regularization could also be used, they are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based on the information provided, Dropout is the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in this particular case.
