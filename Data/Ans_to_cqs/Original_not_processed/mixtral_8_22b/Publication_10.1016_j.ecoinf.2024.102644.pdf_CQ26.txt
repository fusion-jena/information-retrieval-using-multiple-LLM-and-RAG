Helpful Answer:
The papers by Coro et al. do not explicitly discuss specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some general approaches to improve data quality and overcome limitations related to data availability and reliability.

In their paper titled "Improving data quality to build a robust distribution model for Architeuthis dux" (2015b), Coro et al. describe how they combined multiple sources of data, including direct observations and records from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF). They also emphasize the importance of accurate and reliable data for building robust models. This approach can help reduce data bias by incorporating more diverse and representative datasets.

Similarly, in their paper "Parallelizing the execution of native data mining algorithms for computational biology" (2015c), Coro et al. discuss parallel computing techniques to process large amounts of data efficiently. Although this does not directly address data bias, it highlights the need for effective data processing methods when dealing with extensive datasets.

Furthermore, in their study on coastal degradation and dune habitats in Tuscany coasts (Bertacchi et al., 2019), the authors rely on data from 180 resident species to analyze the situation in the region. While this paper is not authored solely by Coro et al., it demonstrates the value of utilizing comprehensive datasets to gain insights into complex environmental issues.

Lastly, in their work on automatic classification of climate change effects on marine species distributions (2016a), Coro et al. acknowledge the challenges posed by limited data availability and advocate for continuous monitoring efforts to gather more information. This suggests that collecting diverse and updated data can contribute to mitigating data bias in ecological modeling.

In conclusion, while the papers by Coro et al. do not provide explicit examples of techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to tackle data bias, they highlight the significance of employing various strategies to enhance data quality and representativeness. These include combining multiple data sources, leveraging efficient data processing methods, and promoting ongoing data collection initiatives.
