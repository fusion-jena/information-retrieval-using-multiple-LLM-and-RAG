5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not mention any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
