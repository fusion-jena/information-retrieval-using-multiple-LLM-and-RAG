3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3. 

4. Discussion

In the next section, the classifications of the real point clouds will be 
made using the MS-trained model, because it was proven that the model 
in this last experiment outperformed the previous ones, and their fuel 
type classifications will be more reliable. 

3.2. Fuel model retrieval

Although the method proposed in this section should be similar to 
the usual workflow in these cases and can be more precise than a manual 
labelling process, the amount of time and the requirement of a visual 
classification  of  the  tree  species  make  it  recommended  to develop  an 
automatic  method  to  segment  point  clouds  in  difficult  environments 
such as thick woods.

Moreover, enhancements in the classification outcomes of fuel types 
can be achieved using advanced DL classification models that can better 
handle  complex  and  high-dimensional  data  from  MS  geoinformation 
such as LiDAR point clouds or MS imagery. DL is a subfield of machine 
learning that uses Artificial NNs to learn from large datasets and make 
accurate predictions using new data (Sharma et al., 2021). The ability of 
DL models to learn complex patterns and relationships in data makes 
them particularly well-suited for fuel model retrieval, where there are 
often  many  variables  and  relationships  to  consider,  such  as  the  hori-
zontal and vertical continuities of different vegetal species (Skowronski 
et al., 2007). For instance, Kalinaki et al. (2023) used DL models such as 
U-Net  and  Deeplabv3+,  to  semantically  classify  forest  and  non-forest 
features  using  Sentinel-2  MS  imagery.  In  addition,  Marjani  et  al.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning (DL) model in this context is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is primarily used for semantic segmentation based on the information given. The authors mention training a DL model and then using it to segment real multi-spectral (MS) point clouds to create a ground truth. They also discuss using the same DL model to perform inference on real MS point clouds, which suggests that the model is being used for some form of image analysis or processing. Furthermore, they reference a specific type of DL architecture called SoftGroup, which has been shown to be effective for semantic segmentation tasks. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the DL model is not directly specified, it appears to be used for semantic segmentation of MS point cloud data.
