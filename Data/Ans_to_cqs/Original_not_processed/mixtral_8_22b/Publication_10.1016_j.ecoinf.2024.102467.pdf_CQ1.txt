%Query
Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that BoTNet uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information from low-resolution feature maps, which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, the paper references other works that use object detection algorithms like Faster R-CNN, indicating that these methods may also rely on image data. Without more context, it cannot be determined if other types of data collection methods such as surveys or sensors were used.
