dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

5.5. Computation time and inference 

Computation  time  for  PCA  + K-Means  is  significantly  shorter 
compared to HCA on the full spectra (Brydegaard et al., 2020; Kouakou 
et al., 2020). While the initial training of the dynamic β-VAE takes a few 
hours depending on the number of epochs, once trained, the inference 
time for the model is comparable with that of using PCA + K-Means. 
Once deployed in the field, the dynamic β-VAE model is not expected to 
be  retrained  regularly  but  to  be  used  as  a  dimensionality  reduction 
method. Therefore, inference time is a more important metric than the 
initial computation time. 

5.6. Exploring the latent space

Fig. 4. Example latent representation of unlabelled field data and the four test species. While all methods map the high dimensional input data to a two dimensional 
feature space, the dynamic β-VAEs creates clusters with less overlap between the species groups. The inclusion of 10% labelled data for training further improves the 
results, yielding denser clusters with less overlap than the unsupervised β-VAE.

All models were implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and 
trained for 5000 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma et al., 2015) 
(cid:0) 3. The models were trained on Nvidia GTX 
with a learning rate of 10
1050 graphics processing unit with 4 GB memory with a batch size of 
256. A decision to adapt β was taken every fifth epoch to avoid random 
fluctuations. The scaling of the clustering loss, γ, in the semi-supervised 
mode was cycled between 0.01 and 0.2 every 100 epochs. 

4.4. Results 

The clustering performance on the labelled test set for the unsuper-
vised and semi-supervised instances of the dynamic β-VAE is presented 
in Table 2. 

The dynamic β-VAE performs better than the baselines in the ARI- 
and AMI-scores which quantifies the intra-class cohesion and inter-class 
separability. While HCA have been successfully used to identify groups

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific platform or cloud service provider used to deploy the dynamic β-VAE model. However, it can be inferred from the statement "Once deployed in the field" that the model has been deployed for practical use, although the exact deployment environment remains unknown.

Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine whether the model was deployed on platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other specific cloud service providers.
