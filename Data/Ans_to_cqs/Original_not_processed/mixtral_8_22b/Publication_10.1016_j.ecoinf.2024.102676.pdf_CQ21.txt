These parameters are the number of selected variables in the model, 
the size of the confidence ellipsoid (counter probability), and the cut-off 
threshold value of the distances between the geometrical mean of the 
trails  (Wards-cut-off  distance).  No  hyperparameter  tuning  has  been 
conducted  and  in  order  to  assure  uniformity,  all  models  of  the  same 
species  were  executed  with  the  default  FIT  parameters  on  the  full 
dataset. 

For  the  second experiment, we applied  the same  approach to real 

missing data points. 

In summary, we analyzed 37 FIT runs per species and compared 185 
model outputs in the first experiment and a total of 13 FIT runs for the 
second experiment.

In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that some form of visualization was performed, as indicated by the involvement of Frederick Kistner and Larissa Slaney in 'Visualization'. Additionally, the authors discuss comparing 185 model outputs in the first experiment and analyzing 37 FIT runs per species, which suggests they may have calculated metrics or evaluated their models using confusion matrices. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, these assumptions remain speculative.
