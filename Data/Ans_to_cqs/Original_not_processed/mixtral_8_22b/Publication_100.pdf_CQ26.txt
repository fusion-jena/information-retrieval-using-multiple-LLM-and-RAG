to get blurred (as information over an increasingly larger receptive
field is mixed through repeated convolutions). We visualize our model
architecture in Fig. 5 and in the following, the data flow in the model
is described in more detail.

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained ùëÄ = 5 models with batch size ùêµ = 64 and a base learning
rate ùõº = 10‚àí4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10‚àí3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter ùúÜ from Eq. (1). We
chose ùõΩ1 = 0.9, ùõΩ2 = 0.999 and ùúñ = 10‚àí8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ‚àº14 days.

5. Experimental results and discussion

that the estimation of the target is unbiased at the given value of the
query. We observe that our predictions generally have low bias across
a large portion of the range, which is consistent with our findings in
Section 5.1. A notable exceptions is the under-estimation of the height-
related variables P95 and MeanH on high trees ‚Äì a well-known effect
when retrieving vegetation height from satellite images (Potapov et al.,
2021; Lang et al., 2019). A similarly pronounced under-estimation bias
at the top of their own value range can be noticed for the canopy
density (Dens) and for the Gini coefficient (Gini); moreover, high
Gini values also tend to cause underestimation of P95. In the opposite
direction, we also observe some (weaker) over-estimation biases for
low reference values. This concerns in particular the Dens and Cover
estimates at low values of Dens, Gini and Cover.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the implementation details of the models and experimental results.

In terms of addressing potential data bias, the authors mentioned using a base learning rate of 10^-4 and applying weight decay to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior. They also chose specific hyperparameters for the Adam optimizer. These choices might help mitigate certain types of bias but do not directly correspond to common preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting or resampling methods.

Additionally, the authors discussed the observation of low bias across a large portion of the range for their predictions, except for some under-estimation biases for height-related variables on high trees and over-estimation biases for low reference values concerning density estimates. While these observations indicate the presence of some bias in the dataset, they do not provide explicit information about how this bias was addressed during preprocessing.
