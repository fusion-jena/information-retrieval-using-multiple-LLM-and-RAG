the  structure  of  FPN  based  on  ResNet152 
(ResNet152FPN)  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  bottom-up  pathway  involes 
generateing output feature maps from various stages of the network (Lin 
et al., 2016), which are denoted as {C1, C2, C3, C4, C5}. To merge fea-
tures extracted from different stages along top-down pathway, the Ci(i =
1, 2, 3, 4) map undergoes an upsampling process, increasing its resolu-
tion by a factor of 2. The upsampled output is then combined with the 
corresponding  bottom-up  feature  map  Cj(j = 2, 3, 4, 5) using  element- 
wise  addition.  This  merging  operation  allows  for  the  integration  of 
high-resolution details from the upsampled map with the existing fea-
tures. In order to mitigate the potential aliasing artifacts resulting from 
the  merging  operation,  a  3 Ã— 3  convolutional  operation  is  applied  to 
each merged map to generate the final feature map. For example, C5  is

for a model to detect and identify them. Under this condition, more CNN 
layers mean that more abstractly semantic information can be extracted. 
Therefore, FRC_ResNet152FPN has more advantages than others in this 
sense.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data repository link without additional information. However, common repositories for sharing research datasets include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to refer to the original paper or contact the authors directly for further clarification regarding the dataset used in their study.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but there is no mention of the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study within the provided context. Please provide me with more information so that I can assist you better.
