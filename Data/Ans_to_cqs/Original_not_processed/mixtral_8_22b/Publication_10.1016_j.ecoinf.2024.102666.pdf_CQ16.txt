of the models assessed in the study. These indices provide a quantitative 
evaluation of the accuracy of the AC algorithms, facilitating the com-
parison and selection  of the most  effective algorithms for  various ap-
plications and scenarios.

2. Study area and data 

2.1. Study area 

The Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau is one of the four plateaus in China, 
situated in the southwest region of the country. Due to the topography of 
the plateau mountains, the lakes in this area are scattered and numerous, 
with an average elevation exceeding 1800 m. Compared to other types 
of lakes, PL have a smaller scale since the high altitude restricts water 
availability and lake size (Zhang et al., 2016). These lakes show high 
sensitivity  to  environmental  changes  such  as  climate  change,  human 
activities, and natural disasters (Feng et al., 2021). Erhai Lake (latitude

sentative example of a PL. It is situated in a south-north intermountain 
basin at an altitude of 1974 m. The lake surfaces an area of 252 km2 with 
an  average  depth  of  10.8  m.  Spectral  experiments  and  water  sample 
collection are conducted at 22 observation points within the lake area as

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as a validation loss plateau or other metrics. However, the text discusses evaluating the accuracy of Atmospheric Correction (AC) algorithms using remote sensing reflectance from satellite images. This process involves comparing the estimated results with in situ measurements, which can be seen in Fig. 3.

In general, machine learning models often use criteria like reaching a minimum validation loss, maximum number of epochs, early stopping, etc., to decide when the model has been sufficiently trained. In this case, while the exact criteria for determining completion may not be mentioned, we can infer that the authors likely evaluated their models based on how closely they could reproduce the actual in situ measurements.
