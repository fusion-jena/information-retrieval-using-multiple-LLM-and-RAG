TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software platform (Abadi et al. 2016) 
that supports deep learning research and applications, having been 
released  by  researchers  at  Google  (Google  Brain  Team;  https://re-
search.google.com/teams/brain/).  We  adapted  and  configured 
TensorFlow  for  application  and  use  in  our  project  via  Python. We 
adjusted  two  parameters  from  their  default  values:  validation  per-
centage and number of training steps. Although the default setting 
for validation percentage was 10%, given small numbers of images 
available for some species, we had to increase this number to 16%. 
For number of training steps, although the default value was 4000 
steps,  we  explored  different  numbers  and  compared  the  results  to 
find  the  optimum  balance  between  computing  time  and  classifica-
tion efficiency.

failings  in  many  public  health  systems  (Martins-Melo  et  al.  2012, 
Ramsey et al. 2014). Arriving at such diagnoses depends rather cru-
cially on vector awareness and correct identification, which is the focus 
of  our  work. To  that  end,  we  have  explored  deep  neural  networks 
(Schmidhuber  2015)  to  automate  several  key  inferential  tasks.  We 
successfully  identified  both  Mexican  and  Brazilian  triatomine  spe-
cies  with  considerable  improvement  in  overall  identification  rates, 
compared with our previous results (Gurgel-Gonçalves et al. 2017). 
Incorporating distributional information for species allowed us to re-
duce local fauna sizes in analyses, making identification easier, which 
increased overall identification rates for local faunas still more.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that the authors adjusted certain parameters within TensorFlow, an open-source software platform used for deep learning research and applications, to optimize their model performance. These adjustments include increasing the validation percentage from its default value of 10% to 16% due to limited image availability for some species, and exploring various numbers of training steps instead of using the default value of 4000 steps. By comparing these results, they aimed to find the optimal balance between computational time and classification efficiency. While these actions do not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate efforts to fine-tune the model for improved accuracy and efficiency.
