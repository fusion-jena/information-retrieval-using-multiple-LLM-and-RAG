data  and  at  inference  time.  We  used  many  different  sets  of  hyper-
parameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements; hence, 
we decided to use the default settings. Finally, we tested working with 
different  spatial  resolutions  of  the  imagery,  most  notably  including 
training runs in which the same images were used at different spatial 
resolutions. We did not find this approach to be beneficial.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors have mentioned using various data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and brightness adjustment in their deep learning pipeline. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset through random transformations. However, the specific details regarding the extent or degree of each transformation applied during the data augmentation process are not explicitly stated in the given context.

Unhelpful Answer:
I do not know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
