Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

high-resolution CHM of the Earth (hereafter “Lang10m”) at 10 m reso-
lution  using  Sentinel-2  optical  images  and  a  deep  learning  approach 
(convolutional neural networks).

2.3. LiDAR data 

2.3.1. GEDI LiDAR data 

We estimated the HH using the recently published and freely avail-
able LiDAR GEDI CHMs Lang10m (Lang et al., 2022; Lang et al., 2022) 
(downloaded  here:  https://langnico.github.io/globalcanopyheight/) 
and Potapov30m (Potapov et al., 2021) (downloaded here: https://glad.

Lang10m  was  derived  fusing  the  GEDI  and  Sentinel-2  images 
through a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022). It has 
spatial resolution of 10 m and is valid for the year 2020. The canopy top 
height was defined as the relative height at which 98% of the energy was 
returned  (RH98).  For  the  modelling  GEDI  observations  for  which  the 
image was cloudy or snow-covered were excluded.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for this purpose.
