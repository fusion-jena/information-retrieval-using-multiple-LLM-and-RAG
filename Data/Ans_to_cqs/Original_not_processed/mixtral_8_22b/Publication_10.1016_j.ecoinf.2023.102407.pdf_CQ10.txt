%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the code repository link for any deep learning pipeline. The provided sources are scientific papers related to various topics such as machine learning, ecology, and computer vision, but they do not contain specific links to code repositories for deep learning pipelines. To find relevant code repositories, one would need to search online using keywords from these papers or look for citations within them that reference publicly available code.
