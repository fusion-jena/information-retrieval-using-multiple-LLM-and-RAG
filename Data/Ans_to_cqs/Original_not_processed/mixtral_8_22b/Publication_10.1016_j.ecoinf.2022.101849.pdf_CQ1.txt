Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

An example training instance for different weakly-labeled settings. Here yj indicates the targets of an instance. Red indicates an 
error in the training data (deviation from ground truth) – it is not known to the user where errors occur. Note that in the weak 
j=1yj = 1 and yj⩾0). In our setting 
label setting, only 0s may be errors. Shading represents a constraint (in this example, that 
(structurally incomplete), the constraint may not be met, but errors are neither random deviations. Mixtures of these settings 
are possible, e.g., we may have structurally incomplete with missing labels, etc.

1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods for gathering raw data in machine learning applications can include using sensors or devices to collect measurements, conducting surveys or experiments to gather data, or utilizing publicly available datasets. It depends on the specific application and requirements of the project.
