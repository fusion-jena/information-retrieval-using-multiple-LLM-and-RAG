A search space of the primary hyperparameters was defined. Opti-
mization  algorithms  were executed to  find  the  highest  accuracy from 
1,788,160  hyperparameter  combinations.  Our  model  was  trained  for 
200 epochs for each trial to find three DNN architectures that were used 
to  build  three  models  and  train  them  for  the  entire  dataset  for  1000 
epochs (Table 2).

adjustable parameters that control network architecture, optimization 
procedure,  and  regularization.  Common  hyperparameters  include 
number of layers and nodes, learning rate, dropout rate, etc. However, 
optimizing  model hyperparameters  remains imperative  for leveraging

3.1. DNN Architecture optimization 

The  optimization  process  considers  three  main  factors.  The  main 
factor is the model’s accuracy when tested using the validation dataset. 
Computation time and costs is the second deciding factor, as both can 
add up over time with the increasing complexity of models and datasets. 
Efficient  methods  for  hyperparameter  optimization  are  necessary  to 
obtain high-performing models while leading to more efficient utiliza-
tion of computational resources. Lastly, commonalities and differences 
between  hyperparameters  can  better  highlight  the  impact  of  each 
hyperparameter on the model’s performance.

Determining  the  optimal  DNN  architecture  is  an  active  area  of 
research. Recent studies have evaluated different techniques for tuning 
hyperparameters, such as network structure, activation functions, reg-
ularization,  and  optimization  algorithms  (Xu  and  Liang,  2021).  For 
instance,  Lecun  et  al.  (1998)  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  sto-
chastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  for  DNN  training.  Though it  has  been 
shown  to  get  stuck  in  local  minima,  momentum  was  shown  to  help 
overcome  this  by  accelerating  SGD  convergence  (Luo  et  al.,  2021). 
Dropout  regularization  has  also proven  essential  for  controlling  over-
fitting  as  network  depth  and  complexity  increase  (Gupta  and  Raza, 
2020). More recently, exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions 
have  gained  some  traction  for  addressing  ReLU  limitations  like  dead 
neurons  and  slow  convergence  (Alkhouly  et  al.,  2021;  Clevert  et  al.,

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it cannot be definitively determined what specific type of Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is being used in the pipeline. The text mentions that a search space of primary hyperparameters was defined and optimization algorithms were executed to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations. It further states that three DNN architectures were found and used to build three models, which were then trained for the entire dataset for 1000 epochs. However, there is no explicit mention of the exact type of DNN model used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot determine the precise type of deep learning model employed in the pipeline.
