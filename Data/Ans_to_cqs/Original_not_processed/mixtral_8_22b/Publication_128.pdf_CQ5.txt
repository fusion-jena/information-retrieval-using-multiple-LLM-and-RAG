AlexNet: In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.[28] constructed a model with more convolutional layers than 
LeNet for better high-dimensional feature extraction, and then three fully connected layers are used after 
flatten layer to pool channel information. This model employed rectified linear activation (ReLU) as 
activation  function  to  speed  up  training  process,  which  partially  solved  the  vanishing  gradient  and 
exploding problem. Features of each layer in AlexNet were depicted in Figure 2. Feature visualization 
of  AlexNet  layer  by  layer.  The  annotations  above  are  defined  as  Nameùëë@k√ók,  and  the  annotations 
below  are  denominated  in  form  of  Operationùëë@r√ór.  Where d , k and r is  feature  depth,  convolution 
kernel and image resolution, respectively..

2.5. Model training 

ÔÅ¨  To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification, the exact 
parameters  and  functions  as  well  as  classifier  built-in  the  six  neural  network  models  are 
designed as follows: 

ÔÅ¨  The resolution of input data is 224√ó224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, and the inputs 

are batch normalized before training; 

ÔÅ¨  Batch size is applied which is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one; 
ÔÅ¨  An  optimized  rectified  linear  activation,  Leaky  ReLU,  was  introduced  into  models  after 

convolution or concatenate layer; 

In MobileNet, width multiplier is 1.2, resolution multiplier is 1; 

ÔÅ¨  Learning rate and dropout rate adopt same value 0.001, bias value is 0;  
ÔÅ¨ 
ÔÅ¨  For the neural networks with lower depth, the higher training epochs are, the higher probability 
of over fitting is. Therefor models in which less than 100 layers adhibit raw data 60 epochs, 
otherwise executed 80 epochs;

and r is feature depth, convolution kernel and image resolution, respectively. 

ResNet: In 2016, He et al.[30] proposed a short connection from low layer to the second higher layer, 
which  increases  network  layers  but  avoids  degradation  at  the  same  time.  The  residual  block  idea  of 
ResNet significantly speeds up the learning process between input data and output data space, which 
makes it easily extended to very deeper learning layers (could be thousands of layers).

Nowadays,  deep  learning  (DL)  becomes  the  most  popular  and  efficient  way  for  large  dataset 
classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the major framework in DL, which describes 
the hidden neural network layers by convolutional kernels. And convolutional kernels are turned out to 
dropout some irrelevant information and capture more essential details[7]. Singh et al.[15] employed a 
multi-layer CNN to identify the disease type of infected Mango leaves‚Äô images; Bayr et al.[16] adopted 
a  AlexNet  type  CNN  for  woody  images  classification;  Nagasubramanian  et  al.[17]  constructed  a  3-
dimension CNN to classify multi-spectral soybean images situation of disease affected. W√§ldchen et 
al.[18]  reviewed  current  deep  learning  approaches  in  plant  image  classification.  All  these  models 
achieved classification accuracy over 95% in the spectrum region of plant health. Various of feature

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning research, some possible datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets are widely used for benchmarking various deep learning architectures such as AlexNet and ResNet mentioned in the context.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is grayscale and has a fixed size of 28x28 pixels.

CIFAR is another popular dataset used for object recognition tasks. It contains 60,000 color images divided into two subsets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 consists of 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes. Each subset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It is often used for training deep learning models for image classification tasks. The dataset is organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, where each node represents a category.

Without explicit mention of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, we can only speculate that they may have been chosen from among these commonly used options.
