the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

address the limitations associated with the acquisition time of satellite 
imagery, resolution, and validation challenges encountered in previous 
studies, while harnessing the advantages of deep learning algorithms.

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study employs a deep learning model, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification. While the context does not explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, some common practices in machine learning could potentially apply here. These include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

Diverse datasets help improve the model's ability to generalize by exposing it to a wide range of examples during training. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into subsets or folds, where the model is trained on one subset and tested on another. This process is repeated until all subsets serve as test sets. It helps assess how well the model will perform on unseen data.

Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes in the train and test sets remains similar to their original proportions in the entire dataset. This technique prevents any bias towards certain classes due to imbalanced representation in either set.

However, without explicit details about the methods employed in this particular study, we cannot definitively state whether these techniques were utilized. Further research or access to the complete study would provide more clarity on this matter.
