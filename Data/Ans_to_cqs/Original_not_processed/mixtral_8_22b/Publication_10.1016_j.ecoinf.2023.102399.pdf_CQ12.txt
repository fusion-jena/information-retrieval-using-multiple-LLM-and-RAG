There is no doubt that low-quality images will increase the workload 
of  image  processing,  requiring  more  complex  algorithms.  Obtaining 
high-quality  images  through  a  fully  automated  biomass  estimation 
method, without any manual intervention, can significantly reduce the 
workload  for  humans.  To  decrease  the  need  for  manual  intervention, 
Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015) implemented a deep learning technique that 
automatically detected and identified the head and mouth of Southern 
Bluefin tuna that were cultured in deep-sea cages. The head and mouth 
of the fish in specific positions within the underwater stereo images were 
accurately recognized using the Haar classifier. Although this technique 
efficiently  decreases  manual  processes,  achieving  fully  automated 
acquisition  of  biomass  information  is  still  lacking  in  certain  aspects.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article discusses a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is used in their pipeline. It could be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or another type like a Transformer. Without further details from the authors, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model they employed.
