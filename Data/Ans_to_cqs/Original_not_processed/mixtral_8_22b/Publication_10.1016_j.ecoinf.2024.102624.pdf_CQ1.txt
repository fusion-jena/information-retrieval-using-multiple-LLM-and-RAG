Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

Thirty models of the 10 input datasets with three classifiers revealed 
that the best five medians belonged to the SVM and RF, while the MARS 
was only ranked 6th (7C) and 10th (13C) (Fig. 6). The best OAs were 
96.1% (7C) and 85.4% (13C), and the model performance also depended 
on the input datasets, while the best accuracy of 7C was obtained with 
the RFE variable selection dataset. In the case of 13C, it required the use 
of  all  variables;  nevertheless,  the  RFE  dataset  ensured  only  slightly 
(1.1%)  worse  OA.  Regarding  the  minimum  OAs,  RF  (with  the  RFE 
dataset)  provided  3.8%  better  results  than  the  SVM  (with  the  RFE 
dataset; 80.7%) in the case of 7C, and we experienced the same in the 
case of 13C, but the difference was only 1.9%. The texture index alone 
was the worst input data, with median OAs of 38.8% and 30.9% (7C and 
13C, respectively), followed by 74.0% and 66.6% for spectral indices,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, one could infer that various types of data might be collected using different techniques such as surveys, sensors, or utilizing publicly available datasets. For instance, the study mentions the use of spectral data from PlanetScope, which suggests the utilization of satellite imagery data. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers, indicating the potential use of machine learning algorithms for processing and analyzing the collected data. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, this remains speculative.
