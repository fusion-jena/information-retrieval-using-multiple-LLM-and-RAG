input into the model network for training.

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this query accurately.
