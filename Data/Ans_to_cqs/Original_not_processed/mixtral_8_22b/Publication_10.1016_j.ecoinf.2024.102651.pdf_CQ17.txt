Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The experimental results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate 
the enhancement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating 
CAM into the residual network. Regardless of “medium”  or “small”  or 
the entire dataset, the best classification results are achieved using the 
CA-Hybrid  network.  Notably,  the  experimental  results  demonstrate  a 
positive correlation between image size and classification performance. 
Specifically, larger image tend to yield better classification outcomes.

tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is 
constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervi-
dae  localized  by  YOLOv7.  Within  the  CA-Hybrid  network,  by  intro-
ducing the CAM (Woo et al., 2018) in the CNN, the network was able to 
focus more on critical features, which boosted the generalization ability 
of the model. Finally, when utilizing the same classification network for 
both small  objects(pixels less than 32*32) and  medium objects(pixels 
between 32*32 and 96*96) to evaluate the influence of image size on 
classification performance, the medium objects achieved higher classi-
fication  accuracy  compared  to  small  objects  under  identical  network. 
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of our monitoring pipeline 
with  object  detection  networks,  the  effectiveness  of  the  pipeline  was 
demonstrated. The pipeline effectively resolves the issue of background

The proposed classification network in this paper demonstrates su-
perior performance on the dataset, as indicated by the results presented 
in Table 3. In each classification network, the accuracy for the “medium” 
is consistently higher than that for the “small”. Besides, the experimental 
data in Table 3 also indicates that the classification network proposed 
achieves the highest classification accuracy among the “medium”  and 
“small”.  In  our  proposed  model,  the  classification  accuracy  for  both 
“medium”  and “small”  is improved by 3.56% and 2.93% respectively, 
compared to the ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the classification ac-
curacy for the “medium” is 5.6% higher compare with the “small” in the 
CA-Hybrid network.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly employed techniques to address overfitting issues in deep learning models. However, without explicit details about the implementation of these methods in the discussed pipeline, it cannot be confirmed if they were utilized.
