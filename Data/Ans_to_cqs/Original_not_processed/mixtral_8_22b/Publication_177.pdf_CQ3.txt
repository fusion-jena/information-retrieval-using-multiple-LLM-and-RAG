learning  models  namely  GoogleNet,  ResNet,  and  ResNeXT 
with different configurations [25]. In another study, Ghazi et 
al.  [26]  ensembled  the  results  of  GoogleNet  and  VGG 
networks  to  obtain  an  accuracy  of  80.18%  on  a  validation 
dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. A bagging ensemble of 
three ResNet152-layered CNN networks was used by Šulc and 
Matas  to  obtain  a  performance  of  78.8%  mean  average 
precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset [27].

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the input data, which is crucial for training machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT mentioned in the context.
