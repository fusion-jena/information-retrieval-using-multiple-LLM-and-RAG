Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

* Dataset: A single or coherent set of data (or a data file) provided by the 
repository as part of a collection, data study, or experiment. These can be of 
multiple file formats such as spreadsheet, video, and audio. Datasets may have 
cited references or can be citable, but more commonly they inherit metadata of 
the overall study. 

** Data study: A description of studies or experiments held in repositories 
with the associated data used in the data study. These are linked to a repository 
and may optionally link to a dataset relating to the more granular data files. 
Data studies can be a citable object in the literature and may have cited ref-
erences attached in their metadata together with information on such aspects 
as  the  principal  investigators,  funding  information,  subject  terms  and 
geographic coverage.

To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.

2.  However,  the  methodologies  of  some  studies  mention  the  use  of 
tools,  such  as  the  F-UJI  to  analyse  datasets  drawn  from  a  specific 
scientific area. These studies employed this approach only for small 
datasets.

%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct reference to any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text discusses various repositories containing datasets related to ecology and agriculture. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
