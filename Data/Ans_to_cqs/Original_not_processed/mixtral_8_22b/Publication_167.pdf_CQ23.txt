The data of a certain year are used as the test set, and the remaining data are the training and
validation set. The training and validation set ia divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation
method, in which nine of the parts are used as a training set and one is used for the validation set.
The percentage of the training, validation, and testing sets is 5.4:0.6:1. The training set is the data
sample used for model ﬁtting. The validation set is a set of samples set aside separately during the
model training. It can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and to conduct a preliminary
evaluation of the model’s capabilities. The testing set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of
the ﬁnal model. However, it cannot be used as a basis for algorithm-related selection such as parameter
tuning and selection of features. The mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of

mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

Input Data

In this paper, the input data are 40-dimensional data. Due to the large time span and large land
area in the training data, there are large diﬀerences in the distribution between diﬀerent batches of
training data in the training stage, and there is a certain distribution diﬀerence between the training set
and the test set. Therefore, batch normalization is performed on the input data, where the speciﬁc
calculation/transformation of BatchNorm (Algorithm 1) is shown below. First, the mean of each
channel in the current batch is calculated, and then, the variance of each channel in the current batch is
calculated. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation
to obtain the normalized output ˆχ
i is multiplied by the scale parameter γ, and the shift
parameter β is added to obtain the ﬁnal output yi:

as the loss function, and the Adam optimization algorithm is used to update the weights of the neural network. Because there are different numbers of samples of the five types of LU suitability samples in the training data, with a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7, there is an imbalance in the categorical data. In the training process, a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples, which solves the problem of the performance of the model being poor for the categories that have small sample sizes.   Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 3314

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of 40-dimensional data spanning over a large time period and covering a vast land area. This diversity helped capture various patterns and trends within the data, enabling the model to learn from multiple scenarios and improving its adaptability to new situations.

Secondly, the authors employed a 10-fold cross-validation method to divide the training and validation set into ten parts. Nine of these parts served as the training set, while the remaining part acted as the validation set. By rotating through all possible combinations of training and validation sets, the model could be trained and evaluated on different portions of the data, further enhancing its robustness and reducing the risk of overfitting.

Lastly, stratified splitting was applied when dealing with the issue of class imbalance in the categorical data. With a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7 among the five types of Land Use (LU) suitability samples in the training data, the authors assigned larger weights to categories with fewer samples and smaller weights to those with more samples. This approach ensured that the model did not favor any particular category due to their respective sample sizes, thereby promoting fair representation across all classes and contributing to the overall generalizability of the deep learning model.
