In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

The training of the network is usually done with a backpropagation 
algorithm,  which  is  divided  into  two  phases.  In  the  first  phase  (for-
warding),  controlled  inputs  are  applied  to  the  network,  pushing  the 
activation of the input layer neurons. The signal propagates to the next 
layers,  finally  reaching  the  output  neurons.  The  error  between  the 
desired  output  and  the  obtained  result  is  then  calculated  for  each 
neuron. In the  second phase  (backwarding), the  error value is  propa-
gated backward and the weights of each link are accordingly modified 
with an optimization method, which aims to minimize the output error. 
Finally, the network “model selection” is achieved by choosing a set of 
hyperparameters (i.e. number of hidden layers, number of neurons in 
each layer, learning rate, solver weight optimization, epoch scale, acti-
vation functions, etc.) which characterize the architecture of the MLP

ETa), where DOY is the Day Of the Year and the actual evapotranspi-
ration  ETa  represents  the  variable  of  interest.  This  feature  has  854 
missing values, and for this reason, the proposed neural network models 
are exploited for ETa  predictions and gap-filling. The climate variables 
and consequently the ETo feature have only three missing values in the 
dataset,  while  the  SWC,  and  VIs  features  have  56  and  1179  missing 
values, respectively, over the four years of observation.

3.3.5. Prediction algorithms and gap filling 

This work exploits ML models also to perform gap-filling procedures 
of  missing  data.  Gaps  are  present  in  the  VIs  because  samples  are  not 
available with the same time resolution of the other variables. Few data 
samples  were  absent  in  other  input  features  as  well  (SWC, ETo,  and 
climate data), as detailed in Section 3.2. Thus, for the missing input data 
described earlier, the KNN-Imputer was utilized to fill in missing values 
using  the  k-Nearest  Neighbor  approach  (Troyanskaya  et  al.,  2001; 
Thirukumaran  and  Sumathi,  2012).  However,  when  the  number  of

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to improve the robustness of deep learning models against overfitting. During training, Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations among them. This helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the algorithm tries to find smaller weights that still provide good predictive accuracy. Smaller weights lead to simpler models, reducing the risk of overfitting.

These regularization methods can be combined or used independently depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context but commonly used in deep learning pipelines include L1 Regularization (also known as Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Batch Normalization.
