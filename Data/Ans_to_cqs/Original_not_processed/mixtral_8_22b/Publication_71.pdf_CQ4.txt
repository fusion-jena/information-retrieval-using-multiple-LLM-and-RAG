makes the deep learning method’s loss function to be biased toward the overrepresented classes resulting in poor classification performance for the underrepresented classes [50]. One should also pay attention when applying deep learning methods to new applications because one requirement for deep learning is the availability of a vast amount of training data. Moreover, the training data needs to have similar characteristics as the testing data. Otherwise, deep learning methods may not yield good performance. Augmenting the training dataset using different brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images could be potential strategies to mitigate the issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data. 5. Conclusions In this paper, we investigated the performance of three methods for vegetation detection. Two of these methods are based on deep learning and another one is an

One other challenge with deep learning methods is when the dataset is imbalanced. With heavily
imbalanced datasets, the error from the overrepresented classes contributes much more to the loss
value than the error contribution from the underrepresented classes. This makes the deep learning
method’s loss function to be biased toward the overrepresented classes resulting in poor classiﬁcation
performance for the underrepresented classes [50]. One should also pay attention when applying deep
learning methods to new applications because one requirement for deep learning is the availability of
a vast amount of training data. Moreover, the training data needs to have similar characteristics as the
testing data. Otherwise, deep learning methods may not yield good performance. Augmenting the
training dataset using diﬀerent brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally ﬂipped versions,
shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images could be potential strategies to

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors mention several data augmentation techniques that can be employed to improve the performance of deep learning models when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when there are differences between the characteristics of the training and testing data. These techniques include adjusting brightness levels, creating vertical and horizontal flips of the original images, shifting, rotating, and introducing noise into the training images. By employing such techniques, it becomes possible to increase the diversity of the training set without actually collecting additional data, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
