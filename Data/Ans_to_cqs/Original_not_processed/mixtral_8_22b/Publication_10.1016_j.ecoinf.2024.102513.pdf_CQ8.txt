2.3. Performing LULC analysis using a deep convolutional neural network 

The  classification  of  LULC  was  carried  out  using  a  convolutional 
neural network (CNN). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an 
architecture of deep neural networks widely applied for land use and 
land cover (LULC) classification (Balarabe and Jordanov, 2021; Li et al., 
2019;  Zaabar  et  al.,  2022).  They  are  specifically  designed  for  image 
processing  and  possess  the  capability  to  automatically  extract  spatial 
hierarchical features from data.

While this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of land 
cover change in the Kerch Peninsula, several avenues for future research 
offer opportunities to enhance the technical aspects of historical land use 
and  land  cover  mapping.  Particularly,  addressing  the  challenge  of 
limited data availability for training deep neural networks in cases of 
sparse historical information warrants further investigation.
