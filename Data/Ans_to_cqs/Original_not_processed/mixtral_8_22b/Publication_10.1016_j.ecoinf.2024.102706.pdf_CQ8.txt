linear to machine learning methods, were fitted in training data to
construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

imagery products equipped with three
different instruments: PlanetScope2 (PS2), PlanetScope2 Super Dove
(PS2 SD), and next-generation PSBlue Super Dove (PSB.SD) (Planet
Team, 2017). The most recent is PSB.SD, which offers three bands
(RGB), four bands (RGB - NIR) and eight bands (RGB - NIR - Coastal Blue
- Green I -Yellow-Red Edge) imagery which is available from mid-March
2020 to date. The PS2.SD (March 2019–April 2022) and PS2 (July
2014–April 2022) offer three and four-band imagery. In our study, four
bands of imagery from PS2 were acquired on 27 July 2020, only two
days before the LiDAR scanning. This cloud-free imagery was the most
proximate one accessible from a selection including 3,4, and 8 bands
PS2, PS2.SD, and PSB.SD, retrieved from the Planet Lab database. The
details of Planet's sensor specifications are given in Table 2. We used an

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does mention that Python 3.12.2 was used along with various libraries like Scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm, but it doesn't provide any details about the location of the source code. Therefore, without additional information, it's not possible to accurately answer this query.
