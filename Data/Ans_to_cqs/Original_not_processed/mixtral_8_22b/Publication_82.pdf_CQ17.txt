of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

To address the issue of over-ﬁtting, we vary the test set
to train set ratio and observe that even in the extreme case
of training on only 20% of the data and testing the trained
model on the rest 80% of the data, the model achieves an
overall accuracy of 98.21% (mean F1 score of 0.9820) in the case
of GoogLeNet::TransferLearning::Color::20–80. As expected, the
overall performance of both AlexNet and GoogLeNet do degrade
if we keep increasing the test set to train set ratio (see Figure 3D),
but the decrease in performance is not as drastic as we would
expect if the model was indeed over-ﬁtting. Figure 3C also shows
that there is no divergence between the validation loss and the
training loss, conﬁrming that over-ﬁtting is not a contributor to
the results we obtain across all our experiments.

Helpful Answer:
The authors of this study employed several strategies to mitigate overfitting in their deep learning models. One approach they utilized was varying the test set to train set ratio. By observing the performance of the models under different ratios, they found that even when training on only 20% of the data and testing on the remaining 80%, the models still achieved high overall accuracy. This indicates that the models did not suffer significantly from overfitting.

In terms of specific regularization techniques, the authors mentioned the use of a dropout layer associated with the first two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7}) in the AlexNet architecture. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. In this case, the dropout ratio was set to 0.5, meaning half of the neurons in these layers were dropped out during each iteration.

Additionally, weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, was applied with a value of 0.0005. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models.

These regularization methods, along with other factors like the choice of deep learning architecture and training mechanisms, contributed to preventing overfitting in the models used in this study.
