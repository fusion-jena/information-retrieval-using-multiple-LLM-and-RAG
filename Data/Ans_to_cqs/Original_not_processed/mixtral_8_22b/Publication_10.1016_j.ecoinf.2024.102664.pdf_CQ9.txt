In  Chl  dynamic  forecasting,  Long Short-term  Memory  (LSTM) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are commonly used deep learning 
models (Baek et al., 2021; Lee and Lee, 2018; Yussof et al., 2021). Re-
searchers have successfully applied CNN and LSTM models to analyze 
Chl  concentration  distribution  in  different  regions  (Jin  et  al.,  2021; 
Yussof et al., 2021). Combining diverse deep learning networks to create 
hybrid models, such as the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, has proven effec-
tive in addressing complex nonlinear challenges (Anderson et al., 2016; 
Wang et al., 2020). This integration offers enhanced forecasting efficacy 
compared to individual network (Barzegar et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2017). 
Advancements  in  ocean  satellite  monitoring  technology  have 
significantly  improved  the  precision  of  satellite  data  (Amani  et  al., 
2022a,  2022b),  making  it  a  crucial  information  source  for  machine

2.3. Deep learning model development 

CNN possesses robust capabilities for image feature extraction and is 
recognized as an effective tool for addressing image recognition chal-
lenges (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Lei et al., 2019). It has also found 
applicability in the domain of time series signal processing (Gautam and 
Singh, 2020; Li et al., 2021). The CNN network architecture comprises 
convolutional  and  pooling  layer,  which  are  the  two  principal  hidden 
layers responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN.

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined if the data repository is accessible through platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
