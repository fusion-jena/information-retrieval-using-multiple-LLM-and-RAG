We  classified  all  the  input  dataset combinations  (10  variable  sets; 
Table  2)  with  each  classifier  (RF,  SVM,  MARS)  and  with  two  sets  of 
classes (7C and 13C); thus, we had 60 models as a result of the classi-
fications. Classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in 
R  4.2  (R  Core  Team,  2023)  with  the  caret  package  (Kuhnaut  et  al., 
2022). 

2.4. Accuracy assessment

Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

indices,  the  Run  percentage  performed  well,  with  the  highest  impor-
tance in previous research (Schlosser et al., 2020), thus, we calculated 
the Run percentage (Eq. 4), using the 8-bit version of the NDVI layer in 
the Orfeo Toolbox in the QGIS 3.16 environment (Grizonnet et al., 2017; 
Miyamoto and Jr, 2008) with nine different kernel and offset parame-
ters. NDVI was selected because it preserved band information, repre-
sented  biomass,  and  guaranteed  visually  distinct  features  for  various 
genus groups. The following parameters were applied: two, three, and 
five kernel (k) options and one, three, and five offset (o) options in all
