portional to permeability, so the following scoring scale was used: very
low – 0.00, low – 0.25, medium – 0.50, high – 0.75 and very high: 1.00.
Once these values were set, they were converted into raster format to
enable determining the mean scores per climate pixel.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. The references provided discuss topics like empty urbanism, bound constrained optimization, habitat factors related to wildlife conservation, and a habitat suitability model for European wild rabbits. None of them mention details regarding deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is impossible to determine what hyperparameters were used in any potential deep learning models.
