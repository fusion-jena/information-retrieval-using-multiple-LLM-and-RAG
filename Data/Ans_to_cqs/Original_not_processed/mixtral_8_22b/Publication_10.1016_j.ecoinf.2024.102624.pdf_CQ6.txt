Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

We  classified  all  the  input  dataset combinations  (10  variable  sets; 
Table  2)  with  each  classifier  (RF,  SVM,  MARS)  and  with  two  sets  of 
classes (7C and 13C); thus, we had 60 models as a result of the classi-
fications. Classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in 
R  4.2  (R  Core  Team,  2023)  with  the  caret  package  (Kuhnaut  et  al., 
2022).

The  reference  dataset  was  split  into  training  and  testing  sets  at  a 
70:30 ratio, and we applied two types of accuracy assessments. (i) In the 
model  building  phase,  using  the  training  dataset,  we  applied  10-fold 
cross-validation  with  three  repetitions.  The  training  dataset  was 
randomly split into 10 folds; 9 folds were used for model training and 1 
for testing, and this procedure ended when all folds were testing data. 
The whole sequence was repeated using two new random splits (Abriha 
et al., 2023; Molinaro et al., 2005). This type of accuracy assessment, 
with  hyperparameter  tuning,  helps  to  find  the  best  models  with  the 
largest  overall  accuracy  (OA),  and  also  reflects  the  resulting  30  OAs 
distribution  models  with  minimums,  maximums,  quartiles,  and  me-
dians. The smaller the range of possible model outcomes (OAs), the more 
reliable the prediction. (ii) Based on the testing dataset, we predicted the

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model. However, some common preprocessing steps often employed include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the final output by adjusting their values to be within a certain range. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, such as removing them or imputing them based on other available information. Additionally, the context mentions strategies like training data augmentation, post-classification, segmentation, and filtering, which enhance the generalization capabilities and reduce salt-and-pepper errors. It also discusses dealing with the geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining training samples, and changing the proportion of training and test data. These strategies collectively improve classification accuracy and enable better modeling of the environment.
