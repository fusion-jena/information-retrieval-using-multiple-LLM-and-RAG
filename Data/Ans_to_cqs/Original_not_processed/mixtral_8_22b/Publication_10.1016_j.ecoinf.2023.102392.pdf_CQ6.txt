inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction model’s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

2.2. Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing 

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data is processed using CATALYST 
PROFESSIONAL image processing software. The UAV data processing 
process is divided into six significant steps.  

i)  Camera parameter correction: this stage aids in identifying and 
correcting  image  distortions  caused  by  lens  curvature,  focal 
length, and perspective effects;  

ii)  Set up  connection points: A linked point is  a  spot that may  be 
visually recognized on overlapping areas between two or more 
images;  

iii)  Point fine-tuning: in this stage, the constraint points established 
in the previous step are improved to eliminate those with high 
error values (values more than 0.5) that were deleted from the 
computational model;  

iv)  Edit ground control points: Establish ground control points to edit 
the  dataset’s  georeferenced  to  the  WGS84/UTM  coordinate 
system;

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect information from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization: This process scales numeric columns to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1. It helps prevent attributes with larger ranges from dominating those with smaller ranges during the learning process.

3. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling transforms features so they have a standard scale. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Standardization.

4. Feature Selection: This involves selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. It reduces overfitting and improves model interpretability.

5. Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models cannot handle non-numeric input directly. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. Techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding can be used.

However, based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning model. But generally, these are common practices when preparing datasets for deep learning tasks.
