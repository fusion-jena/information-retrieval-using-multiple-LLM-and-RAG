Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Fig. 1 shows an extract from a JSON file that includes the identifier 
number, metric name with results (output), evaluation score, debugging 
messages, and a  summary of  all metrics in  the evaluation. Finally, to 
visualize the scores after compiling all the PIDs, we created a report by 
running a computational notebook (. ipynb document) provided by the 
FAIRsFAIR team (Devaraju and Huber, 2021a). This notebook provides 
an overall analysis and visualisation of all PID responses assessed using 
the F-UJI. 

In summary, a) the report reads JSON’s responses, b) collects all the 
total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame, and c) visualises the 
metrics  and  summarises  the  evaluations  (in  our  case,  the  datasets 
associated with each repository). The characteristics of the report are 
discussed in the Section 3. 

For further analysis, two aspects of the findings of this study were 

considered.

3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

6. Conclusions 

addressing  data  quality.  For  this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  continue 
developing metrics such as the one proposed by F-UJI and methodolo-
gies  such  as  the  one  proposed  in  this  study  that  favour  not  only  the 
availability of data but also that they are really useful to use, share, and 
reuse. 

Regarding F-UJI, as mentioned by its creators, it is a continuously 
developing tool. Automatic testing of research data objects is based on 
the FAIR ecosystem, and its success depends on automatic testing with 
clear criteria that can be evaluated using machines.

Thus, we used the second approach to perform a massive evaluation 

featuring many datasets (5967 PIDs).

After  compilation,  the  tool  produces  JSON  files  for  each  PID  that 
contain the assessment results. These files include scores, practical tests, 
inputs/outputs, and assessment contexts for each of the 16 metrics (see 
the demo of the tool in FAIRsFAIR, 2020).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, some insights into the postprocessing steps can be derived indirectly.

After running the F-UJI tool, the results are stored in JSON format containing various details including metric names, results, evaluation scores, debugging messages, and a summary of all metrics in the evaluation. To analyze these results, a computational notebook was utilized to create a report. This report performs three main tasks:

1. Reads JSON responses and collects total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame.
2. Visualizes the metrics and summarizes the evaluations.
3. Provides an overall analysis and visualization of all PID responses assessed using the F-UJI tool.

These steps indicate that the postprocessing involves reading the output JSON files, collecting relevant scores, and creating visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the results. Although not explicitly stated, these steps could potentially involve calculating metrics and generating plots similar to those found in other machine learning applications, such as confusion matrices or saliency maps. However, without more explicit information regarding the nature of the models being trained, it cannot be confirmed if these specific techniques would apply directly to this scenario.
