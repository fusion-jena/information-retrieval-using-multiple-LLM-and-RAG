Abstract

1.  Digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big data-

sets and typically must be pre- processed prior to conducting analyses. One crucial 

image pre- processing step in any image analysis workflow is image segmentation, 

or the ability to clearly contrast the foreground target from the background noise 

in an image. This procedure is typically done manually, creating a potential bot-

tleneck for efforts to quantify biodiversity from image databases. Image segmen-

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I would recommend checking these platforms for a repository associated with the authors Shawn T. Schwartz and Michael E. Alfaro, or searching for the name of the toolkit mentioned in the article, "Sashimi".

Based on my knowledge cutoff, I do not have information about the exact location of the code repository. It is also possible that the authors did not publicly release their code. For more specific details, please refer to the original research paper or contact the corresponding author directly.
