This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

achieved with Ppf-CM based SAE method, suggesting SAE beneﬁted
more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages
using Ppf-CM (Table 4). This was mainly because, compared to the
traditional machine learning method (SVM), deep learning method
(SAE) can easily capture and exploit more complex information with its
deep network structure and strong self-learning ability (Penatti et al.,
2015; Xie et al., 2015).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning models (SAE and SVM). However, generally speaking, common preprocessing techniques applied before training deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling adjusts the scale of independent variables to bring all variables to an approximate magnitude, which helps prevent any single variable from dominating the outcome. Cleaning refers to handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting.
