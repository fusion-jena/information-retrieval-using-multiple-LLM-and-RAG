Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’. 

Funding

All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques can include stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes or labels remains consistent across training, validation, and test sets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to balance the dataset. Another approach is diverse data collection, which aims to gather a wide range of representative samples to reduce potential biases in the dataset. These methods help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and ensure fairness in model performance.

Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers have collected data using sensors deployed in two locations - the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea. The data consists of valve gaping measurements, temperature, and chlorophyll levels. To analyze this data, they averaged the gaping data over different intervals depending on the location due to varying deployment periods. They also mention using daily curves of gaping as input in their analysis. While there is no explicit discussion of addressing data bias, one could infer that the researchers might have considered factors such as differences in deployment times and averaging intervals when processing the data to minimize any potential biases introduced by these variations.
