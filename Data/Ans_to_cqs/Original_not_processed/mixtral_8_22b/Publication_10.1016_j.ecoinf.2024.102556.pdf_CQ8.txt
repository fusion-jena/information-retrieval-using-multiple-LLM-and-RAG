to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

map and reduces the matching accuracy. 

To strike a balance between the strengths and weaknesses of shallow 
and deep networks, MSF fusion techniques were employed for feature- 
extraction  from  Procapra  przewalskii  in  the  target  detection  frames. 
Currently,  common  MSF  fusion  methods  include  the  FPN  (Lin  et  al., 
2017) and BiFPN (Tan et al., 2020), which rely on fusing features with 
varying resolutions within a layer structure. Although they enhance the 
network’s  capability  for  MSF  extraction,  they  introduce  additional 
complexity to the network structure.

In recent years, the integration of UAV technology and deep learning 
(DL) has resulted in extensive applications in wildlife monitoring. DL is 
equipped  with  UAV  technology  and  can  analyze  massive  amounts  of 
data  in  real  time, addressing  issues  associated  with  low detection  ac-
curacy, high model complexity, and poor real-time effects of traditional 
machine learning methods. This combination effectively addresses the 
inefficient  nature  of  wildlife  monitoring, 
time-consuming  and 

particularly in challenging high-altitude environments. Fig. 1 illustrates 
its key concepts. In addition, the combination of UAVs and DL has been 
applied  in  a  diverse  array  of  animal  studies.  These  include  mapping 
habitats,  estimating  species  abundance  and  distribution,  measuring 
physiological parameters, assisting in anti-poaching efforts, and study-
ing anti-predator responses (Schad and Fischer, 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects such as multi-scale feature extraction networks, the use of UAV technology and deep learning in wildlife monitoring, and some related research papers. However, there is no mention of a particular code repository or version control system like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
