INTRODUCTION

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

images will soon allow many ecological applications that are
now practically impossible. These include early detection of the
arrival of invasive species, disease vectors or crop pests into
new areas; identiﬁcation of insect migration pathways to allow
eﬀective design of ecological corridors; and predicting climate-
change eﬀects by insect densities, activity seasons, body sizes, age
distributions, and sex ratios along climatic gradients.
