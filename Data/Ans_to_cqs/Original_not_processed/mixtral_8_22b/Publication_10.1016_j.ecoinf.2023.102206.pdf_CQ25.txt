are predicted by this learned function f(). 

- Transfer learning: If Ts is the learning task for a source

domain Ds  and Tt  is the learning task for a target domain Dt, then the 
rationale  of  TL  is  to  model  a  learning  function  ft() in  Dt  by  utilizing 
Ds and Ts, when Ds ∕= Dt or Ts ∕= Tt.

However, when both domains are precisely similar (i.e. Ds = Dt) and 
their  corresponding  learning  tasks  are  also  similar  (Ts = Tt),  the 
learning problem changes to a machine learning approach.

Proposed IFTL

• This provides valuable information for understanding the 
environmental impact of energy consumption and helps in 
formulating effective policies to reduce CO2 emissions. 
• Proposed work assesses the air quality where concentration 

and toxicity levels are modelled using IT2 FSs.  

• Helps to identify contributing components for the resulting air 
quality, which further may enhance decision-making pro-
cesses related to environmental policies and health-related 
issues. 

• This work utilizes acoustic data and deep CNN to identify 

oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows.  

• Also, provide ways for monitoring and early warning systems 

on pig farms.  

• Better reproduction capability in sows may upscale the 
economic efficiency and production level of pigs.  

• A sustainable perspective for the pig farming operations. 
• The ecological implications of the proposed work are directly 
associated with the increasing CO2 emissions resulting from 
industrialization.

then combined with common latent feature space to generate one latent 
feature space layer. Moreover, to learn the corresponding distributions 
on different layers, multiple layers are generated which learns with their 
pluralism,  simultaneously.  Salaken  et  al.,  (2019)  employed  deep 
learning in which  a small sample of target domain is  used as seed to 
transform  source  domain  dataset.  Sousa  et  al.,  (2020)  proposed  a 
transfer  learning  approach  with  data  augmentation  techniques  for 
wildfire detection to overcome data limitations.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes. In the context of land use classification, the authors propose an Inductive Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) technique implemented within the framework of label refinement. While the specific details of how the deep learning model fits into this technique are not provided, it is reasonable to assume that it could be utilized for classifying land use types based on input features such as satellite imagery or other relevant data sources. Additionally, the mention of a "small sample of target domain" being used as a seed to transform the source domain dataset suggests that the deep learning model might be involved in adapting the source domain data to better match the characteristics of the target domain, potentially improving the overall performance of the land use classification system.
