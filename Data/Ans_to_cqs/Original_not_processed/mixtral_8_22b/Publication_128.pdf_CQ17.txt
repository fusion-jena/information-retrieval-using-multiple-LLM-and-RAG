DenseNet: In 2017 Huang et al.[31] proposed a scheme to reduce hyper-parameters and guarantee 
gradient  propagate,  which  aims  to  release  gradient  vanishing  through  feature  reuse  and  bypass. 
DenseNet has a nice mathematical structure and high classification performance, but it needs a long 
computational time.

2.5. Model training 

ÔÅ¨  To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification, the exact 
parameters  and  functions  as  well  as  classifier  built-in  the  six  neural  network  models  are 
designed as follows: 

ÔÅ¨  The resolution of input data is 224√ó224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format, and the inputs 

are batch normalized before training; 

ÔÅ¨  Batch size is applied which is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one; 
ÔÅ¨  An  optimized  rectified  linear  activation,  Leaky  ReLU,  was  introduced  into  models  after 

convolution or concatenate layer; 

In MobileNet, width multiplier is 1.2, resolution multiplier is 1; 

ÔÅ¨  Learning rate and dropout rate adopt same value 0.001, bias value is 0;  
ÔÅ¨ 
ÔÅ¨  For the neural networks with lower depth, the higher training epochs are, the higher probability 
of over fitting is. Therefor models in which less than 100 layers adhibit raw data 60 epochs, 
otherwise executed 80 epochs;

AlexNet: In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.[28] constructed a model with more convolutional layers than 
LeNet for better high-dimensional feature extraction, and then three fully connected layers are used after 
flatten layer to pool channel information. This model employed rectified linear activation (ReLU) as 
activation  function  to  speed  up  training  process,  which  partially  solved  the  vanishing  gradient  and 
exploding problem. Features of each layer in AlexNet were depicted in Figure 2. Feature visualization

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there are some indications of techniques used to prevent overfitting. One method mentioned is the use of an optimized rectified linear activation, Leaky ReLU, which can help in preventing overfitting by introducing nonlinearity and reducing the risk of saturation. Additionally, the paper mentions adjusting the number of training epochs based on the depth of the neural network, with fewer epochs for shallower networks to avoid overfitting. Lastly, the paper discusses the use of batch normalization before training, which can also act as a form of regularization by reducing internal covariate shift and improving the stability of the learning process.
