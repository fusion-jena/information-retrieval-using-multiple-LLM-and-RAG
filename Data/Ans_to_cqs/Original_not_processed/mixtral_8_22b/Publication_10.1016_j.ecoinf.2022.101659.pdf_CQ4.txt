All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’. 

Funding

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

(Jørgensen et al., 1988), changes to gaping can have long term conse-
quences on organisms energetics. Obtaining values of energetic expen-
diture  associated  with  valve  movements  would  be  highly  valuable  to 
gain a deeper understanding and to be able to model the consequences of 
gaping changes, not only in terms of its modulation of energy input, but 
also to account for associated energetic loss. Bioenergetic models can be 
used to inform both aquaculture practices and management measures: e. 
g. allocation of space for aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021b; Brigolin 
et  al.,  2017);  quantification  of  ecosystem  functioning  and  services 
associated both with aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021a; Brigolin et al., 
2009) and with naturally occurring populations. It would thus be useful 
to  apply  this  clustering  methodology,  which  yielded  some  consistent 
results amongst two species and two areas, to analyse gaping data from

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available and reduce overfitting. However, without further details or context regarding the use of deep learning methods, it cannot be determined if these techniques were employed in this case.
