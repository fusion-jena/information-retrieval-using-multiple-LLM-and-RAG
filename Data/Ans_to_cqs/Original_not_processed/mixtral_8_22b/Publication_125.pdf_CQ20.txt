4.2.1. Data Augmentation

Execution Time

All runtimes reported in this section were measured on the Google Colab repository
with a CPU running at 2.30GHz. Table 10 presents a detail of the runtime for each CNN
model. The training runtime for VGG16, Xception, and ResNet50 is 22.27, 21.26, and
30.8 min, respectively. Additionally, the prediction runtime for these models is 0.803,
0.827, and 1.835 s, respectively. The training runtime for DenceNet121 and the proposed
model is 18.34 and 16.43 min, and the prediction runtime is 4.134 and 0.976 s, respectively.
Accordingly, the computation overhead varies from one model to another. However,
PHE data are signiﬁcantly fast during both training and prediction and therefore the
computation overhead of the proposed encryption schema is low.

5.2. Experimental Set-Up

The hardware conﬁguration and software used for the encryption process are:

Graphics processing unit: Intel Core i5-3210M (2.50 GHZ).

•
• Memory: 4 GB.
• Operating system: Windows 10 Professional.
•

Visual Studio Code with Python 3.9 extension.

These CNN experiments are conducted using the Google Colab repository, which
allowed us to execute Python code through the browser and also provided access to
NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPUs). The libraries used to conduct these experiments
are the Keras DL library and TensorFlow backend, a DL platform. The proposed model
was trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of
0.001, 32 batch size and 100 epochs.

5.5. Discussion

Recent years have seen increasing concerns about protecting the privacy of conﬁdential
information when processing data using models. This leads to the need for cryptographic
techniques to solve privacy concerns in data-driven models. Several PPDL techniques have
been proposed in the literature to solve these concerns. This research is, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst work that investigates PPDL for satellite image classiﬁcation.

Helpful Answer:
The hardware configuration used for training the deep learning model includes NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), accessed via the Google Colab repository. The specific GPU type is not mentioned in the given information. The other hardware components listed include an Intel Core i5-3210M processor running at 2.50 GHz and 4GB of memory, but these are associated with the encryption process rather than the deep learning model training.
