Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Typically,  a  higher  F1-score  (score  close  to  1)  indicates  a  better 
model performance, as it signifies a better balance between precision 
and recall. A low F1-score (score close to 0) suggests that the model may 
struggle  to  accurately  classify  positive  instances  and/or  may  miss  a 
significant  number of  positive instances.  Since the  classification algo-
rithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization 
of weights in ANN or random sampling during training. The experiments 
are performed over different runs to help capture the variability intro-
duced by these random factors.

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, there are some indications about how the performance was evaluated. It appears that the F1-score was used as a metric to assess the model's performance, where a score closer to 1 indicated better performance due to a good balance between precision and recall. Additionally, multiple runs were conducted to account for any variability introduced by random factors, such as random initialization of weights in artificial neural networks (ANNs) or random sampling during training. Therefore, while the specific monitoring strategy is unclear, we can infer that the overall approach involved evaluating the F1-score across multiple runs to ensure robustness and reliability in the results.
