4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

The cellular automata (CA) model has received widespread attention 
for its effectiveness in simulating land use expansion (Deep and Saklani, 
2014). The CA model and the Markov chain prediction model (Markov- 
CA) can be used to forecast land conversion under different scenarios 
(Deep  and  Saklani,  2014;  Ghosh  et  al.,  2017).  In  addition,  the  paral-
lelized  urban land  use simulation (PLUS) model,  which combines  the 
Markov-CA  model  and  the  random  forest  classifier  (RFC)  forecasting 
method, has been widely applied (Liang et al., 2021; Nie et al., 2023). 
The  PLUS  model,  which  combines  spatial  econometrics  and  environ-
mental science, provides an excellent data mining framework and land 
evolution  mechanism  and  can  predict  land  conversion  trends  more 
accurately  (Xu  et  al.,  2023a).  However,  as  the  PLUS  model  uses  the 
Markov chain prediction model to infer future land use conversion, it

Helpful Answer:

The context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, generally, in machine learning and deep learning practices, there are several commonly used strategies for splitting datasets. These include:

1. Random Split: Data is randomly divided into training, testing, and sometimes validation sets. A typical ratio might be 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation.

2. Stratified Sampling: When dealing with imbalanced classes, stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.

3. Time Series Split: For time-series data, where order matters, a chronological split is often employed. For example, earlier data could be used for training, while later data serves as the test set.

4. Cross-Validation: This involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or 'folds'. Each fold is then used once as a validation set, while the remaining k - 1 folds form the training set. This process is repeated k times, ensuring all observations serve as both training and validation instances.

Without explicit information from the given context, one cannot definitively state which strategy was used for this particular study.
