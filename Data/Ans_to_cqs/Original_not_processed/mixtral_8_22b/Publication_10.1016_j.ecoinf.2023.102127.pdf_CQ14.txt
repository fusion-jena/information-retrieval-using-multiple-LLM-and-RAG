are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will 
raise warnings and highlighted messages in case the provided informa-
tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

et  al.,  2017).  These  models  are  usually  the  most  computationally 
intensive, but also the most elegant as all integration is done through 
dataset specific likelihoods (Fig. 2h).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, whether it's through grid search, random search, or other methods. However, there are references to regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent, which could suggest that some form of optimization technique is used. Additionally, the text mentions that certain models can be computationally intensive, implying that efficient optimization techniques might be necessary. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized based solely on the provided context.
