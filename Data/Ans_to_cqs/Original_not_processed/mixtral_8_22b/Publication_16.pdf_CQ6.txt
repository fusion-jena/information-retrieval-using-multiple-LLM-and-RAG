MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies. 
A.  Data Collection and Description

(3) 

The MLP is configured with a filter size of 2 and is used 
with Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as 
the optimiser. A dropout value of 50% has been used in the 
first  three  layers  to  improve  generalisation  and  reduce 
overfitting. The first three layers are composed of 256 nodes 
while the final layer is equal to the number of classes in our 
dataset. The model summary is shown in figure 5. 

overfitting.  This  section  concludes  the  methods  used  in  this 
paper to train the model. 

The  performance  of  the  trained  model  is  measured  using 
Sensitivity,  Specificity,  Precision  and  Accuracy.  The 
Sensitivity  describes 
the 
Specificity describes the true negative rate. Precision is used 
to show the number of correctly classified species.

The  acquired  audio  files  are  transmitted  over  4G  using 
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. 
Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature extractor 
function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features 
for the classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged 
to the site for review.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this section the classification results are presented using 
the  evaluation  metrics  outlined  previously.  The  deployment 
and inferencing of the trained model in test environment are 
also presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the end-to-end 
pipeline. 
A.  Species Classification Performance

The results presented in this section were obtained over 100 
epochs. Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the 
test  and  validation  data  during  model  training.  The  figure 
shows  that  there  was  no  overfitting  during  training  and  that 
the dropout layers helped with model regularisation. Although 
model convergence was achieved early in the training session 
the loss shows continuing decreases throughout the specified 
epochs.

Training Session. 

Table 1 shows the performance metrics obtained using the 
test data. The best performing class was the Eurasian Collard 
Dove achieving a Sensitivity of 0.86 and a Specificity of 0.90. 
The  worst  performing  class  was 
the  Lesser  Spotted 
Woodpecker  where  the  model  attained  a  Sensitivity  of  0.58 
and a Specificity of 0.91.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized the Librosa library for data pre-processing. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training their deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. Generally speaking, common preprocessing steps for audio data may include normalization, scaling, noise reduction or removal, and feature extraction techniques such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). In this case, the authors do mention using MFCC for feature extraction from the audio samples. Additionally, they discuss segmenting the audio files into 15-second windows, which could be considered another form of preprocessing.
