4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  users’  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in any particular deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters like weight decay or dropout rate. These hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model and need to be carefully tuned based on the problem domain and available data. For example, the learning rate controls how much the weights of the network should change during each iteration of optimization, while the choice of optimizer determines the algorithm used to update these weights. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The batch size specifies the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters, while the number of epochs refers to the total number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network during training. Regularization techniques like weight decay and dropout help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the complexity of the learned model. To determine the optimal values for these hyperparameters, various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms can be employed.
