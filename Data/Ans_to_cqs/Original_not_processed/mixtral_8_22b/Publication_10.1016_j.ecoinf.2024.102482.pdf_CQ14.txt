The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

The input layer receives two-dimensional data of size [observation 
time (s) × 4, 1]. As mentioned (section 2.4.3), the output vector sizes of 
the three LSTM layers were set to 32, 32, and 16, respectively, and a 
dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. The number of stacked 
LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model 
hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve 
optimal performance. 

We have summarized the components of the proposed system into an 
overall  learning  and  testing  procedure  of  the  monitoring  system  in 
Fig. 6. During the learning stage, features are extracted from the training 
data set using the previously introduced feature extraction algorithm, 
and the  model is  trained. After the training is  completed, the trained 
model  is  used  to  predict  water  conditions  and  analyze  performance 
using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage. 

2.4.5. Performance metrics

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

Helpful Answer:
According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized through various experiments to achieve optimal performance. Specifically, the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters are adjusted until the best results are obtained. However, the exact optimization technique used, whether it's grid search, random search, or another method, is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model.
