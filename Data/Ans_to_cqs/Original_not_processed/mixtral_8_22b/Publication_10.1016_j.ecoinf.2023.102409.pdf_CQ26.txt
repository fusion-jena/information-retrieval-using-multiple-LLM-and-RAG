to augment the feature map size, aligning with the encoder’s pooling 
layer.  Each  decoder  module  concatenates  its  output  with  the  corre-
sponding encoder output. The final decoder tensor undergoes convolu-
tion and then traverses through a softmax layer, normalizing the output 
probabilities for two classes at each pixel (Gao et al., 2022; He et al., 
2022;  Qiu  et  al.,  2023).  The  model’s  initial  learning  rate  was  set  to 
0.0001, subsequently fine-tuned through iterative testing. The number 
of iterations was 150, the batch size was configured as 2, utilizing the 
Adam optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function.

activation function, aiding the network in learning the image’s low-level 
features. Post each convolutional block, a max-pooling layer is appen-
ded to reduce the feature map size while retaining essential information. 
The decoder (right dashed square) processes this vector to generate a 
full-resolution segmentation of the input image. It comprises multiple 
inverse convolution blocks, each housing an inverse convolution layer 
(also  known as  transposed  convolution),  batch  normalization, and  an 
activation function. These blocks facilitate the comprehension of high- 
level  semantic  information  about  the  image  (Wang  et  al.,  2023a). 
Following each inverse convolution block, a sampling layer is integrated

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details regarding techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine which techniques were employed from the available information.
