predictions. In contrast, machine learning, particularly neural networks, 
and deep learning provides powerful tools for pattern recognition, albeit 
with  challenges  in  data  requirements  and  interpretability  (see  (Barak 
and  Tsodyks,  2023;  Kliegr  et  al.,  2020;  Kuru  et  al.,  2023;  Tron  and 
Margaliot, 2004; Vos et al., 2006)). By adopting an integrative approach, 
we not only maintain the interpretability of traditional models but also 
benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, advancing 
our ability to predict behavioral outcomes in a wide range of scenarios. 
This methodology propels our investigation forward, opening new av-
enues  for  anticipating  animal  behavior  in  various  conditions  and 
emphasizing the controlled settings of T-maze experiments.

In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.

5.3.3. Results analysis and comparison 

The integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classification  algorithms  (see  (Bansal  et  al.,  2022; 
Boateng  et  al.,  2020)),  along  with  a  Principal  Component  Analysis- 
Support  Vector  Machine  (PCA-SVM)  hybrid  approach  (Hai  and  An, 
2016), has significantly enhanced our understanding of zebrafish and rat 
movements within T-maze environments. This comprehensive analysis, 
as  detailed  in  Tables  3  and  4,  showcases  the  detailed  insights  gained 
from these methodologies. For zebrafish, the KNN model demonstrated 
high precision and recall in identifying left movements, with impressive

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for tasks like object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, etc.
