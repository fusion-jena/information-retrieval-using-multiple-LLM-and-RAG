Addressing the pressing issue of water contamination in aquaculture, 
this research has presented a comprehensive framework that effectively 
classifies water quality to ensure ecosystem sustainability and the health 
of  aquatic  organisms.  Existing  deep  learning  approaches  often  face 
challenges  related  to  data  heterogeneity,  interpretability,  and  perfor-
mance.  In  response,  our  study  proposes  a  powerful  solution  that  in-
tegrates IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation, resulting in 
precise water contamination classification. By leveraging real-time data 
from  IoT  devices,  including  temperature,  pH,  dissolved  oxygen,  and 
nitrate concentration, we enable a holistic assessment of water quality. 
Employing  fish-specific  acceptable  ranges,  we  calculate  a  water 
contamination index, facilitating the accurate segregation of data into 
contaminated and non-contaminated classes. This critical step ensures

Water contamination presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting the sustainability of ecosystems 
and  the  health  of  aquatic  organisms.  Precisely  assessing  water  contamination  levels  is  crucial  for  effective 
monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating 
water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. 
Integrating  computer  technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  and  Data 
Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have 
limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study 
proposes  a  comprehensive  framework  that  incorporates  IoT-based  data  collection  and  data  segregation  tech-

Furthermore, Chou et al. (2018) demonstrated a machine learning 
method for evaluating the water quality in reservoirs, highlighting the 
ANNs model's accuracy while expressing worries about its scalability. 
Our study presents a customized paradigm for water pollution analysis 
in aquaculture, building on previous efforts. The AODEGRU model of-
fers increased accuracy and efficiency while addressing scaling issues. 
The  use  of  deep  learning  models  for  classifying  water  pollution  in 
aquaculture is still developing, despite its potential in several domains 
(Arepalli and Naik, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c; Zhang et al., 2021; Haq and 
Harigovindan,  2022).  Current  deep  learning  models  face  difficulties 
including inconsistent data, interpretability constraints, and poor per-
formance in this setting. To address this, we provide a novel attention 
based AODEGRU model in our study, which deviates greatly from pre-
