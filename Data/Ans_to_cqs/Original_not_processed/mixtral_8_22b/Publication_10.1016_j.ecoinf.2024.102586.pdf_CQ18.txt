accuracy in comparison to other supervised learning techniques (Brei-
man, 2001; Archer and Kimes, 2008) and allows quantification of var-
iable importance for each potential predictor. To obtain a high level of 
predicted  accuracy,  the  RF  model,  a  regression  tree  method  uses 

bootstrap aggregation and randomisation of predictors (Rigatti, 2017). 
The  model  works  by  using  the  training  dataset  containing  both  the 
response  and  predictor variables,  associated  distance matrix,  and  dis-
tance  thresholds  (Benito,  2021).  The  distance  threshold  is  simply  a

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the study employs the Random Forest (RF) model to examine the relative importance of selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance. However, there is no explicit information regarding the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. In general, when implementing machine learning models like Random Forest, strategies such as cross-validation or bootstrapping can be employed to assess the model's performance during training. These methods help evaluate how well the model will perform on unseen data and prevent overfitting. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific strategy was utilized in this case.
