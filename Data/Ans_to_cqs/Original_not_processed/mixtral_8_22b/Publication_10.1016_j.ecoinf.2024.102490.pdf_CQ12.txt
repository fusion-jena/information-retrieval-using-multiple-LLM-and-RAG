Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are mentions of various machine learning models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Structured Error Regression (SER), Functional Data Analysis (FDA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), MaxNet, and others. These are not specifically deep learning models but rather traditional machine learning algorithms. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
