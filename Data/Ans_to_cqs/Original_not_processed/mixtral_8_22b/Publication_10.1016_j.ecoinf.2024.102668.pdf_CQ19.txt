The Acoustic Complexity Index (ACIft) was proposed by Pieretti et al. (2011). It is based on the biological hypothesis that many biotic sounds have 
intrinsic variability in their frequency bands, in contrast to anthropophonic noise that tends to be constant, such as car and airplane traffic. It was 
initially proposed to quantify bird calls since they present significant intensity variations in the vocalization frequencies. However, its use has been 
extended to different tasks, such as analyzing habitat quality, communities, and the richness of various species (Buxton et al., 2018).

we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the study. The authors discuss using deep learning techniques for audio signal processing but do not provide details regarding the implementation or the frameworks employed. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context alone whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other specific deep learning framework was utilized in building the models.
