shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views.

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models.

5.2.3. Proposed models

In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

sound (Bai et al., 2020). In the meantime, many scholars have adopted 
deep learning methods to extract deep features. Deep learning feature 
extraction is to obtain new deep features from the raw audio or extracted 
handcrafted  features  through  the  deep  learning  architecture.  For 
example,  Xie  and  Zhu  used  the  CNN  layers  for  learning  generalized 
features and dimension reduction, while a conventional fully connected 
layer was used to classify 14 species of birds collected from Xeno-Canto 
website. The final best F1score is 95.95% (Xie and Zhu, 2019). Liu et al. 
extracted  the  WT  spectrum  of  birdsong and  constructed a  multi-scale 
CNN to achieve birdsong classification (Liu et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did not explicitly mention using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques. Instead, they focused on other aspects such as feature extraction, feature selection, and model evaluation.

To enhance the robustness of their model, the authors employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolution kernel pooling layers to extract deep features from the input data. This approach allowed them to capture complex patterns within the data, thereby improving the overall performance of the model. Additionally, they included a dropout layer in the fully connected layer to minimize overfitting by reducing the number of network parameters.

Regarding feature selection, the authors utilized a combination of handcrafted features (F1, F2, and F3) along with automatically learned features (F4, F5, F6, and F7) derived from various transformations like Fourier Transform (FT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). They also explored the fusion of these features to further boost the model's discriminative power.

Moreover, the authors evaluated their proposed models using a comprehensive dataset consisting of both training and testing subsets. Specifically, they allocated 80% of the data for training purposes and reserved the remaining 20% for testing. By doing so, they aimed to assess the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, thus ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Overall, although the authors did not directly address specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they still implemented several strategies to promote the generalizability of their deep learning model. These include employing a sophisticated feature extraction process, incorporating a variety of handcrafted and automatically learned features, and rigorously evaluating the model's performance on a separate testing subset.
