As it has been proven, ELMs are an important approach for handling and analysing Big
Data as they require the minimum training time relative to the corresponding engineering
learning algorithms. Moreover ELMs do not require ﬁne manipulations to determine their
operating parameters and ﬁnally they can determine the appropriate output weights
towards the most eﬀective resolution of a problem. What is most important, they have
in contrast to corresponding methods which adjust their
the potential to generalize,

performance based solely on their training data set. It is obvious that the emerging use of
ELM in Big Data analysis as well as DELE creates serious prerequisites for complex systems’
development by low-cost machines.

Before introducing our proposed algorithm, it would be essential to discuss the existing basic
theoretical framework. The question of whether a small Neural Network architecture can
learn a lot, even from huge training data sets, was answered in the aﬃrmative by ELM. An
ELM (Cambria & Guang-Bin, 2013) is a Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network
(SLFFNN) with N hidden neurons, randomly selected input weights and random values of
bias in the hidden layer, while the weights at its output are calculated with a single multipli-
cation of vector matrices. SLFFNNs are used in ELMs because of their ability to approach any
continuous function and to classify any discontinuous areas. An ELM can accurately learn N
samples, and its learning speed can be even thousands of times greater than the speed of
conventional Back Propagation Feed Forward Neural Networks (BP_FFNN).
