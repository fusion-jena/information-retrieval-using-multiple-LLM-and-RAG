With the rapid development of multi-scale data and multi-method
coupling research, scholars have started to base their research on
qualitative (Chen, 2020), quantitative (Liao et al., 2021; Mu et al.,
2019), frequency (Lu et al., 2021), probabilistic (Zhao and Xu, 2020),
temporal (Shen et al., 2019), spatial (Zhao et al., 2022) and other multi-
scale data. Improvements in random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al.,
2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), deep learning (Ren
et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed
effects (Yu et al., 2021a) models for improved fusion, e.g., Gu et al. (Gu
et al., 2024) fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least
squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography,
climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Research
in natural areas such as agro-land ecology has been performed in the
exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems

(Leng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022c), ecological sustainability assessment
(Lu et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2022), farmer behavioral decision-making
and crop management system optimization (Ren et al., 2020), and

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers have made improvements in deep learning models for better fusion. It also cites a few studies where deep learning algorithms were applied, but none of them specify the exact type of deep learning model used. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine which type of deep learning model was employed in the pipeline.
