a i represented serial number of training set Traini, i = 1, 2, …, 7. Here
Train1 was initial training set and Traini (i = 2, 3, …, 7) was in-
cremental training set.

Model Evaluation
Model performance evaluation included both errors and
time costs evaluation. The iteration termination condition
of the model was the same in each round training (i.e., the
loss rate of the model was less than a preset threshold ɛ
−4]). We used the same test set (Test) to
[here ɛ = 1.0 × 10
evaluate the performance of models in diﬀerent training
phases. The model error evaluation used three metrics that
included overall error, commission error, and omission
error, which were deﬁned by equations (2), (3) and (4).

and test the DCNN model. On another Dell PowerEdge

The incremental training mode performed consistently with

Because the accuracy
(97.3%) of our method is higher than that of human vol-
unteers (96.6%; Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), it can be applied
to actual ecological monitoring projects. Second, the time
and personnel costs of labeling small‐scale training sets are
much lower than that of million‐scale training sets. Note
that to manually label ~5.5 million images, nearly 30,000
persons have spent ~14.6 years with a 40‐hour work week
(Swanson et al. 2015, Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), which

Helpful Answer:
After training the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model using either the incremental or zero-start training modes, the authors deployed their trained model onto different platforms for testing purposes. For instance, they utilized a platform equipped with a 3.6 GHz central processing unit (CPU) and 32 GB of memory to evaluate the incrementally trained DCNN model. Additionally, they employed another Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server featuring dual Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory to assess both the zero-start and incrementally trained models. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specifics regarding model serialization or other deployment details beyond these hardware configurations.
