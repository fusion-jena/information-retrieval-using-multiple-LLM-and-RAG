monitoring  globally  and  for  efficient  pest  management  (Preti  et  al., 
2021). Deep-learning methods are increasingly used for classification in 
many fields and are emerging in entomology (Høye et al., 2021). Such 
methods require large training datasets to provide robust predictions, 
which has so far been a limiting factor in entomological applications. 
Specifically,  insects  are  very  diverse  and  their  abundance  is  highly 
variable,  which  often  results  in  unbalanced  datasets  with  numerous 
classes  nested  inside  each  other  in  a  taxonomic  hierarchy.  As  these 
methods mature and are implemented in monitoring programs, the de-
mand for greater taxonomic resolution of classifications will increase. So 
far, the level of fine-grained classification is still rather limited, not least 
because classification models rely on training data where images have 
species labels assigned to them.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that bounding boxes were used for object detection or localization tasks based on the mention of "bounding boxes" in the first sentence. Bounding boxes are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation to draw rectangles around objects of interest. In this case, they might have been used to identify and locate insects within images. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding other potential data annotation techniques like instance segmentation or semantic segmentation.
