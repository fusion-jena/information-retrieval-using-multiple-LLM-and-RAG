Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model.

training  (i.e.,  bagging),  then  to  obtain  unbiased  estimates  of  model 
performance  without  omitting  portions  of  the  feature  space  during 
validation. An important note is that the latter procedure also enables 
leveraging of spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction. 
Bagging normally proceeds by drawing many bootstrap samples of 
the data and training models on each, which are aggregated to form an 
ensemble predictor (Breiman, 1996). Individual data points each have 
probability P(si) = 1
n  of being selected during a single draw of a single 
bootstrap sample, where si  is one of n data points distributed over the 
study  area.  Non-independent  data  observations  can  be  considered  as 
partial replication of some information in the modelling dataset. In an 
extreme example, consider two data points at the same location with 
exactly the same environmental measurements. We could conceptualize

Recognizing the potential confluence of these factors, we believe it 
may be efficient to address issues of biased model training and valida-
tion simultaneously in some cases. Here we focus specifically on boot-
strap aggregation applications (i.e., “bagging”; Breiman, 1996), which 
are now widely applied for predictive geospatial modelling, for example, 
as implemented via Random Forest (Breiman, 2001). The bagging pro-
cess itself provides a useful probability-based mechanism for addressing 
both sources of bias using bootstrapping. Spatially correlated map errors 
may result from modelling of clustered sample data, and we propose to 
correct for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using 
residual spatial autocorrelation information in the bagging procedure. 
This  is  achieved  by  determining  weights  according  to  empirical  esti-
mates of spatially autocorrelated errors to first reduce bias during model

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide any direct information about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the use of bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) in machine learning models, particularly in the context of reducing bias during model training and validation. Bagging is an ensemble method that involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset, fitting a model to each subset, and combining their predictions to improve overall performance. It is often used with decision tree algorithms like Random Forest. While bagging is not an optimization technique per se, it contributes to improving the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models.
