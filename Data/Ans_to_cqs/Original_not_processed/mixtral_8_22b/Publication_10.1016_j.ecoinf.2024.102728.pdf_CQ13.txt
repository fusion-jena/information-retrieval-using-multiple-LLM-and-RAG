l=1

Where U is the union of l1 and l2 classification, such that the higher-
level classification (l1) with more classes (n = 32) is represented as el-
ements (∈) of the lower-level classification (l2) with fewer classes (n =
6), the nested classification between l1 & l2 is the reclassification of the
thematic spectral classes of l1 into the information classes of l2. Based on

a simple linear regression, the l1 / l2 crosstabulation results proved
insufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community
configurations.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact values or types of hyperparameters employed in this case. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, etc.), batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, and others depending on the specific architecture and problem being addressed.
