• CNN  window  size  (dim-filter-cnn)  ∈ [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].  The  convolution 
window size determines the size of the region over which convolu-
tion  is  applied  at  each  time  step.  It  is  important  to  choose  an 
appropriate window size to capture the relevant temporal patterns in 
the data.  

• the  number  of  filters  (nbr-filters-cnn)  ∈ [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64,
72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128].The  number  of  filters  determines 
how many different patterns the network can learn. The higher the 
number of filters, the more complex the network can be, but this can 
also make training more difficult.

Monitoring the impact of human activities on the environment is a major challenge as many pollutants can be 
found in the different ecosystems. This is the case of the caesium-137 that has been present in the environment 
for  many  decades  as  a  result  of  atmospheric  tests,  accidents  such  as  Chernobyl  and  release  from  nuclear  in-
dustries. With the recent advance in data-driven models, this study evaluate the relevance of a deep learning tool 
for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers. An encoder-decoder neural network, 
“Hierarchical  Attention-Based  Recurrent  Highway  Networks”(HRHN),  is  proposed  notably  for  its  ability  to 
extract the most relevant temporal and spatial information from the databases. Three monitoring stations were 
studied, one on the Rhˆone River and two on the Loire River, all of them downstream nuclear industries in these

encoder and the decoder:  

• hidden  layers  (nbr-layers-RHN)  ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  The  hidden  layers 
allow the neural network to model non-linear relationships between 
inputs  and  outputs.  Each  hidden  layer  in  a  deep  neural  network 
computes a non-linear transformation of the previous layer's outputs, 
allowing  the  network  to  learn  increasingly  abstract  and  complex 
features as information is propagated through the network.  

• dimension of hidden state (dim-RHN) ∈ [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 
, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128].The  dimension  of  the  hidden  state 
determines the size of the hidden state vectors that are calculated at 
each time step of the model. A higher dimension of the hidden state 
can allow the model to capture more complex and subtle information 
in the data, but it can also make the model slower to train and require 
more training data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined if the data repository is available on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
