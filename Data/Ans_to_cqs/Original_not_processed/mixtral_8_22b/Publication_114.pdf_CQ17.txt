CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in
the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem
by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity
and projection shortcuts) have been introduced for residual learning. Recently, these networks have
been introduced into the ﬁeld of remote sensing.

kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs.

In their review, Ma et al. [26] showed that nearly 200 publications using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been published in the ﬁeld of remote sensing by early 2019 of which most
focused on land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation [28], urban feature extraction [29–31], and
crop detection [32,33]. Deep learning approaches often require a large amount of training data, and
there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches
in the abovementioned remote sensing ﬁelds. Compared with the studies mentioned above, very
few studies using deep learning have focused on trees or forest classiﬁcation [34]. Flood et al. [35]
used a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution
three-band Earth-I imagery. In their research, a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled for training.
The ﬁnal results were pixel-wise and only two types (trees and large shrubs) were mapped. If there are

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization helps improve the model's ability to generalize by adding constraints during the optimization process.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a thinned version of the original network. This prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons and encourages each neuron to learn independently useful information. During prediction time, all neurons are used but scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of weights. By penalizing large weights, this method discourages the model from relying too heavily on any single input feature, promoting more distributed representations and reducing overfitting. The strength of the penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which uses the absolute value of weights instead of squaring them, and early stopping, where training is halted once validation error stops improving. These methods can be combined or applied individually depending on the specific requirements of the task and dataset.
