INTRODUCTION

Deep  learning  is  a  relatively  recent  development  in  ML.  Its 
main tool, the deep neural network (DNN), builds upon Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) which were already conceived in the 
middle of the last century. Essentially, “deep learning” refers to a 
set of techniques that allow the training of larger (more neurons) 
and  deeper  (more  layers)  ANNs  (Nielsen,  2015).  These  high 
capacity  networks  became  possible  due  to  the  development  of 
improved  algorithms  for  optimizing  connection  weights  [e.g., 
stochastic  gradient  descent  (Rumelhart  et  al.,  1986)]  and  a 
steep  increase  in  available  computing  power  and  training  data 
(Goodfellow et al., 2016). While these improvements may seem 
only gradual, current DNNs not only outperform their simpler 
ANN  ancestors,  but  frequently  also  perform  better  than  other 
ML approaches in standardized tests of prediction accuracy (e.g.,

guide for designing and training of DNNs, as well as practical 
considerations for DNN applications.

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the general use of deep learning that various types of data formats could potentially be utilized depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. For instance, if the task involves image recognition or analysis, then image data would likely be employed. Similarly, if the task pertains to speech or sound processing, then audio files might be incorporated into the model. In the case of video analysis tasks, video data would naturally form part of the input dataset. Furthermore, structured datasets like those found in CSV format could also serve as inputs for certain problems. Therefore, without explicit information about the particular application discussed in the given context, we cannot definitively state what type of data format was used in this case.
