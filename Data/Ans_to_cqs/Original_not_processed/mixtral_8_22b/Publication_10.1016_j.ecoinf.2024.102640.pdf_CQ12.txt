5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

The  MiT  encoder  of  SegFormer  is  designed  as  a  hierarchically 
transformer structure, which can generates the high-resolution coarse 
features  and  the  low-resolution  fine-grained  features.  The  MiT  trans-
former  blocks  use  the  sequence  reduction  process  in  self-attention 
layers,  which  can  reduce  the  computational  burden  by  a  constant 
ratio.  In  addition,  each  transformer  block  directly  places  a  Mix-FNN 
component  (zoomed in  at  the  right bottom  part of  Fig. 12),  along its 
feed-forward path and right before its output. With the Mix-FNN policy, 
SegFormer  does  not  need  to  train  positional  encoding  and  then,  can 
work with better generalization ability. The ALL-MLP decoder of Seg-
former consists entirely of MLP components, which are arranged in four 
main steps. With introducing few additional parameters, the ALL-MLP 
decoder  is  simple  but  effective,  because  its  input  (i.e.,  the  MiT  en-

SegFormer offers a set of MiT encoders (marked by MiT-B0, up to 
MiT-B5) with increasing model sizes. To strike a balance between per-
formance  and  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  model  deployment  on 
resource-constrained  mobile  devices,  we  choose  the  MiT-B1  as  the 
encoder of GVI learning. We train the model on a server with an NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The weights pretrained on 
ImageNet-1 K dataset are used to initialize the encoder and decoder. In 
training, we use the AdamW optimizer with the momentum parameter 
(cid:0) 8  to prevent division by zero. 
(β1
We employ a cosine annealing schedule and set the initial learning rate 
to 0.0001. The model is trained on the UGE-D dataset for 100 epochs 
with the batch size of eight. We supervise SegFormer's training with the 
Cross-Entropy loss function, which is formulated as:
