The utilization of an imbalanced dataset for training a deep learning 
model may introduce inherent biases and limitations (Dong et al., 2018). 
It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  the  dataset  used  may  not  fully 
capture  the  diverse  range  of  bird  populations  present  in  the  wild 
(Gregory and van Strien, 2010). This can result in a biased representa-
tion, potentially impacting the accuracy and generalization ability of the 
model. Factors such as geographical bias, limited sample sizes, or un-
derrepresentation of certain bird species can all contribute to this issue 
(Devenish-Nelson et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the 
limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting 
the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recog-
nition.  Additionally,  efforts  should  be  made  to  collect  more  compre-
hensive  and  diverse  datasets  that  better  reflect  the  true  variability  of

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the specific data repositories where the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context are stored is not explicitly stated. However, some papers mention online sources and specific datasets like CUB-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011) and Birdsnap (BirdGuides, 2012). To find out exactly where these datasets are located, one would need to refer back to the original source material or contact the authors directly.
