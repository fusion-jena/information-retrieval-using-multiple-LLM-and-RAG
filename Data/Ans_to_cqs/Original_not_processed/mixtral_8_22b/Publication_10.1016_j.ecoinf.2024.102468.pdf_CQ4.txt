WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of wavelet transform hidden Markov models (WT-HMM) for enhancing classification performance and emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training. It also mentions a study by Ibrahim et al. (2018) focusing on feature extraction methods for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls but does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Similarly, another cited work by Kaiser and Hudgins (1994) introduces wavelets, which can be used for signal processing tasks like denoising or compression, but again, no explicit reference to data augmentation techniques is made. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
