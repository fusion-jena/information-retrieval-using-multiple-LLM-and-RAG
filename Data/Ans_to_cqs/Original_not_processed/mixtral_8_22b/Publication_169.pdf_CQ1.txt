In  this  work,  a  combined  architecture  is 
proposed  where  by  the  CNN  layer  is 
embedded with the long short-term (LSTM) 
memory  layer  to  pass  those  significant 
features extracted in the initial layers to the 
deeper layers of the network. This supports 
effective  aggregation  of  feature  maps  for 
precise classification and ultimately accurate 
recognition.

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to

Helpful Answer:
The paper utilizes a publicly available dataset called "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains images of various plant species in grayscale format. It appears that the authors did not collect their own raw data but instead relied on existing datasets for their research. Therefore, no specific method for collecting raw data is mentioned in the given context. However, it should be noted that the use of publicly available datasets is a common practice in deep learning research, especially when dealing with image classification tasks. These datasets often contain labeled examples that can be used to train and evaluate models without the need for manual labeling or collection of new data.
