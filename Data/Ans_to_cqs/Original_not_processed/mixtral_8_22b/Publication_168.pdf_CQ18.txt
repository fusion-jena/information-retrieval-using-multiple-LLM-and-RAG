IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  experiment  is  performed  on  the  UAV  hyperspectral 
image  described  in  section  II.  There  are  ten  different  land-
cover  classes  in  the  captured  UAV  hyperspectral  image  as 
shown in Table I. Considering it is hard to label hyperspectral 
image in the real world, we split the labeled pixels of UAV 
hyperspectral image into the training set and test set with the 
ratio 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights 
and  biases  of  the  network,  and  the  test  samples  are  used  to 
evaluate the classification performance.

SSPCNN  produced  competitive  performance  compared  with 
other methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION

To quantitatively evaluate the classification performance, 
average  accuracy(AA),  overall  accuracy  (OA)  and  kappa 
coefficient (K) are  selected as performance  measures. Here, 
OA represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples 
in  the  total  samples;  AA  represents  the  average  of  each 
category classification accuracies; Kappa coefficient is used 
to  measure 
this  article 
for  consistency 
classification accuracy. Kappa coefficient is a consistency test 
metric.

test, 

The SVM,1-D-CNN, and 2-D-CNN methods are selected 
as  the  contrastive  algorithms.  The  experimental  results  are 
reported in Table II.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific strategy employed for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors have divided their dataset into two parts - one for training and another for testing purposes. This approach allows them to assess how well the model has learned by evaluating its performance on unseen data (the test set). Additionally, they use three metrics to gauge the model's effectiveness: Average Accuracy (AA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Coefficient (K). These measurements provide insights into the model's ability to accurately classify samples across all categories and its overall consistency in making correct predictions.
