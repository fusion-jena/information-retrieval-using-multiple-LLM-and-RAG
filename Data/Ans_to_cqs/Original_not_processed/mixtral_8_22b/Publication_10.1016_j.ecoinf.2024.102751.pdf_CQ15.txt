Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

Where yi is actual value, yp is predicted value and ‘n’ is number of

observations.

The values of predictors were finally extracted for the whole study
area in a regular 10 × 10 m square grid and used for wall-to-wall pre-
diction of VWC using the developed GAM model. Figures showing the
spatial distribution of predicted VWC, and its standard error were
created.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, the text does suggest the potential application of machine learning or deep neural networks for increasing the accuracy of predictions related to soil moisture estimation. These models often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam during their training process to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that if these methods were implemented, they might utilize optimization techniques like SGD or Adam.
