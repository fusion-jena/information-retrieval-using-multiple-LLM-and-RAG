Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

To solve the problem of high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences, we introduce
a deep learning model to extract useful features and classify ﬁsh from different families,
which is effective and robust.
To address the problem of overﬁtting caused by small dataset due to the limited
number of species in the family, the Elastic Net is introduced for the proposed method
to improve the generalization ability.

• We employ EN-SAE model to receive the outgroup scores. The decision threshold is
automatically learned by the KDE technique. A novel predictor is proposed based on
the outgroup scores, while other classiﬁcation studies often omit the importance of
automatic learning threshold.

• We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method, and the results show
that the ESK model outperforms four commonly used machine learning methods.
The effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed model for ﬁsh classiﬁcation
is demonstrated.

Abstract: Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world. Fish taxonomy
is an important component of biodiversity and the basis of ﬁshery resources management. The
DNA barcode based on a short sequence fragment is a valuable molecular tool for ﬁsh classiﬁcation.
However, the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of
ﬁsh species make it difﬁcult to reasonably analyze the DNA sequences and correctly classify ﬁsh
from different families. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic
Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK model. In
stage one, the ESK preprocesses original data from DNA barcode sequences. In stage two, EN-SAE is
used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each ﬁsh. In stage three, KDE is
used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify ﬁsh from different families. The

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that the Elastic Net is employed to improve the generalization ability of the ESK model and solve the overfitting problem when dealing with small datasets. This suggests that some form of regularization, possibly combined with weight decay, might be utilized within the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the use of autoencoders implies that unsupervised feature learning could play a role in optimizing the overall performance of the model.
