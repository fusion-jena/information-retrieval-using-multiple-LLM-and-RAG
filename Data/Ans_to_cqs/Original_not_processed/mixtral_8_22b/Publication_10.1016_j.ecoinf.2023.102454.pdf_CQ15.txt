where  i  is  the  type  of  energy  source;  Gi  is  the  annual  consumption 
amount of energy i, Ei  is the standard coal conversion factor of energy 
source type i, and each type of energy consumption can be converted to 
standard coal consumption based on its calorific value; Ki is the emission 
coefficient of CO2 for each type of energy source; and 44/12 is the molar 
ratio of CO2  to C. The energy consumption statistics of this study are 
broadly classified into nine categories, encompassing raw coal, crude, 
coke, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity.

sumption and economic development. Additionally, due to the low ur-
banization  rate,  sparse  population,  and  lack  of  industries  in  the 
surrounding areas, future development processes should incubate and 
catalyse new industries and business forms with green, low-carbon, and 
eco-cycling as the growth points to enhance carbon sequestration. At the 
same time, we must strictly control the use of coal and use technological 
progress  to  promote  urbanization  development  and  realise  the  con-
struction of a picturesque countryside.

2.1.1. Study area 

Since  the  reform  and  opening  up,  Xi'an,  as  the  core  city  of  the 
Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration and a national central city, has 
been  experiencing rapid economic  development while  simultaneously 
driving  the  economic  development  of  Northwest  China  (Zhang  et  al., 
2022). Currently, Xi'an is repositioned as the core city of the “Belt and 
Road”, supporting the east and starting the west, connecting north and 
south. Xi'an is situated in the middle of the Guanzhong Plain, spanning 
45′N, as 
between longitude 107
illustrated in Fig. 2. As of 2021, the total area of Xi'an is 10,108 km2, 
encompassing  11  districts  and  two  counties.  The  city  has  a  resident 
population  of  12.952  million,  a  gross  domestic  product  of  1002.03 
billion yuan, and a population urbanization rate of 79.49%.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to this query. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively.

Based on the given context, it appears that the research focuses on constructing provincial-scale fitting models using various data types such as land cover, meteorology, socioeconomic factors, and carbon emissions. While these models may involve machine learning or deep learning algorithms, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam being employed in the deep learning pipeline.
