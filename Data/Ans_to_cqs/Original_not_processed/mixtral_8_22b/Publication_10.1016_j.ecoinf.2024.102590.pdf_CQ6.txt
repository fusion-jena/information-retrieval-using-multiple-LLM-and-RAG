The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity.

2.3.1. Data upload and script preparation 

To perform a land cover (LC) classification, GEE requires two initial 
inputs:  an  aerial  image  and  the  boundary  of  the  area  of  interest.  We 
uploaded the subplot boundary and the aerial images of each subplot as 
GEE  assets.  Once  the  assets  were  imported  into  our  JavaScript-based 
program,  the  training/validation  datasets  could  be  created.  Since  we 
were interested in extracting the woody cover, we divided our training 
point features into two cover classes: ‘non-woody’ (LC property = 1) and 
‘woody’  (LC  property  = 2).  Woody  cover  was  considered  to  be  all 
vegetation  with  woody  stems  (i.e.,  excluding  grasses  and  forbs), 
including  trees  that  were  shrubby  (i.e.,  multi-stemmed)  and  short  in

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps may be required depending on the specific dataset and problem being addressed. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalizing the inputs helps ensure that no single feature dominates the others during training, leading to more stable gradients and faster convergence.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the values of input features to bring them to a similar scale. Common scaling techniques include standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and min-max scaling (rescaling the values to lie between 0 and 1).

3. Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or erroneous information from the dataset. Examples of cleaning operations include handling missing values, removing outliers, and eliminating duplicate entries.

4. Feature engineering: This refers to creating new features based on existing ones to improve the performance of the model. Techniques like polynomial expansion, binarization, and encoding categorical variables can help create meaningful representations of the data.

5. Augmentation: For image data, augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, cropping, and zooming can increase the diversity of the training set and reduce overfitting.

In summary, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, and augmentation play crucial roles in preparing the data for training a deep learning model. These techniques help improve the quality of the input data, making it easier for the model to learn patterns and generalize well to unseen examples.
