Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

Helpful Answer:
The discussion does not provide explicit information about the purpose of any deep learning models used in the development of the equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool. However, it mentions that the tool has various features such as zoom in/out, search bar, environmental justice indices, map legend, filtering metrics, online data addition, basemap selection, and sharing options. It also highlights that users can access pollutant loads before and after Best Management Practices (BMP) implementation using a drop-down menu. Based on these features, one could infer that if a deep learning model were employed, it might be used for tasks like image recognition, pattern analysis, or predictive modeling related to environmental justice indices, pollutant loads, or BMP effectiveness. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the use of deep learning models in the tool, we cannot definitively state their purpose.
