Other studies have noted that reducing the pixel size from 25 m to 5 m in 
urban areas increases the value of the pollination model (Grafius et al., 
2016). Furthermore, Rayner et al. (2021) found that reducing the pixel 
size from 100 to 10 m yield the prediction of abundance of wild bees by 
43%. As a result, they recommend using the 10 m resolution pixel in an 
agricultural context to make more accurate decisions when interpreting 
the output of the crop pollination model.

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly address this topic. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to modeling pollination services, such as the use of different pixel sizes, comparison between literature-based and field data, and different models for evaluating ecosystem services. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query based on the given context.

However, to address the query indirectly, one can mention that randomness is often handled in deep learning pipelines through techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of randomness. These techniques help ensure consistent results across multiple runs of the same model or improve overall performance by combining predictions from several models trained with different initial conditions.
