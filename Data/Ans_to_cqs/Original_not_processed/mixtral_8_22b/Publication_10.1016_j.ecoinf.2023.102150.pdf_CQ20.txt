We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

Fig. 3. The camera trap developed by Soininen et al. (2015) consists of a Reconyx camera that is mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small 
mammals. The camera traps are protected with stones when placed in the field.

training  data  set. The  models were  trained on  a  cloud  service  with  1 
GPU,  4  CPUs  and  16  GB  RAM  provided  by  Sigma2  -  the  National 
Infrastructure  for  High  Performance  Computing  and  Data  Storage  in 
Norway. 

We evaluated the model performance on the validation data set and 
the  out-of-sample  test  data  set  by  calculating  model  accuracy  as  the 
number of correct predictions divided by the number of all images as 
well as precision, recall and F1 score for each class (Appendix B): 

Precision =

Recall =

TP + FP

F1 = 2*

(TP = Truepositives)

(FP = Falsepositives)

(FN = Falsenegatives)

from  the  images  taken  between  summer  2020  and  summer  2021  for  model 
retraining.
