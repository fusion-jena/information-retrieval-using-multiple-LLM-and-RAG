We evaluated the model performance utilising leave-one-out cross- 
validation, (LOOCV) approach. In the LOOCV approach, one observa-
tion at a time is extracted from the dataset and the model parameters are 
estimated  using  the  remaining  (n-1)  observations.  The  model  is  then 
applied to the extracted observation. 

3. Results 

The  GEDI  data  and  the  available  field  data  did  not  coincide 
geographically or in size. Thus, we have compared the GEDI L4A AGBD 
footprint values with AGBD estimated from the Sentinel-2 models. We 
also compared the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field 
data and GEDI data, respectively to understand the relationship between 
GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field based 
values at the two study area.

Spectral  values  for  all  100  m  resolution  Sentinel-2  bands  were 
extracted to the GEDI footprints the using bilinear interpolation method 
in which we done taking the weighted average determined by the value 
of the four nearest 100 m pixels and their relative position or weighted 
distance adjusted to account for their distance from the centre of the 
GEDI footprint. By resampling Sentinel-2 images to the size of the field 
plots (100 m × 100 m) we lose valuable details which might have an 
negative influence on our AGBD model. 

A regression model estimating AGBD was constructed using Sentinel-2 
spectral  data  of  100  m  (all  spectral  bands  except  bands  1,  9  and  10) 
and the available field data (Eq. (1)).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the evaluation of the model performance does not explicitly mention any specific metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., which are commonly used in evaluating deep learning models. Instead, the text mentions that they utilized the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach to evaluate the model performance. This approach involves removing one observation from the dataset, training the model on the remaining observations, and then testing the model on the removed observation. This process is repeated until each observation has been left out once. While this approach can provide insights into the model's ability to generalize to new data, it does not directly measure traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated what metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
