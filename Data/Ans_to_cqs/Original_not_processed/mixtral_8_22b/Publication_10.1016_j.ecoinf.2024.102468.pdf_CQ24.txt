WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

(14) 

Typically,  a  higher  F1-score  (score  close  to  1)  indicates  a  better 
model performance, as it signifies a better balance between precision 
and recall. A low F1-score (score close to 0) suggests that the model may 
struggle  to  accurately  classify  positive  instances  and/or  may  miss  a 
significant  number of  positive instances.  Since the  classification algo-
rithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization 
of weights in ANN or random sampling during training. The experiments 
are performed over different runs to help capture the variability intro-
duced by these random factors. 

3.3. WT-HMM performance with different dataset sizes

Sequel to training the two HMMs independently, HMM1 and HMM2 
are combined to form an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture 
weights. One of the HMMs is represented by the first 1–4 states, and the 
other  HMM  is  represented  by  the  following  5–8  states.  Specifically, 
states 1–4 depict the waveform of blue whale vocalizations while states 
5–8  represent  the  noise  signal.  Subsequently,  the  feature  vectors 
extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian 
parameters to produce refined feature vectors. The V-alg employs these 
refined feature vectors, along with T  and π, to classify the test dataset as 
either blue whale vocalizations or noise. It is noteworthy that that the V- 
alg switches from states 1–4 to states 5–8 with equal transition proba-
bilities. Table 1 shows the parameters used for WT-HMM simulation.

2.5. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 

The  HMMs  are  powerful  statistical  models  widely  used  in  various 
fields,  including  speech  recognition,  bioinformatics,  and  natural  lan-
guage processing (Rabiner, 1989; Rabiner and Juang, 1986). At the core 
of  an  HMM  is  the  concept  of  hidden  states,  which  are  not  directly 
observable  but  are  assumed  to  generate  observed  data.  Each  hidden 
state represents a particular underlying system or phenomenon, and the 
transitions between states are governed by probabilities. Additionally, 
each state emits observable symbols or outputs with associated proba-
bilities (Rabiner, 1989; Rabiner and Juang, 1986).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, performing multiple runs of the experiment, and averaging results across those runs. Setting a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of results, while running multiple trials helps account for variability introduced by random factors like weight initialization in neural networks or random sampling during training. By averaging results across multiple runs, we can obtain a more robust estimate of model performance. In this case, the WT-HMM was evaluated over 10 runs with varying dataset sizes to capture the impact of randomness on its performance.
