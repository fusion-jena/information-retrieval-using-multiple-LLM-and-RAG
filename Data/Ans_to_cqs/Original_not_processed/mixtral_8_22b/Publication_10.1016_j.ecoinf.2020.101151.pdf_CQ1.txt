2.5. Vegetation

for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that some form of remote sensing or satellite imagery is being used, as evidenced by the mention of a "spatial resolution" and "grid cells." This suggests that the data collection method might involve using satellites or other forms of remote sensing technology. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the "nine-cell approach," which could imply the use of a specific type of sensor array or data processing technique. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it is difficult to definitively state what methods are being used for data collection.
