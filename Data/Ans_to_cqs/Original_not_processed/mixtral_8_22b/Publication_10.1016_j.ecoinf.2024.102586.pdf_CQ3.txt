specimens of the native species (~ 3200) from the alien species (~ 800). 
The specimens of alien species belonged to different categories such as 
cultivated, casual, naturalised and invasive. Only the specimens of those

2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a category, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques can be applied to various types of data, including text, audio, and video, depending on the requirements of the project. In this case, without further context, it cannot be determined which specific technique was employed.
