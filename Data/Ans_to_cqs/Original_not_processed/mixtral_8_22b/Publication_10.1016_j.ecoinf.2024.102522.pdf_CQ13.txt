Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

From Table 11, the correct prediction rate for “present” was 76.84%, 
the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 77.55%, and the 
overall  validation  accuracy  was  76.17%.  The  results  showed  that  the 
accuracy  of  the  model  in  predicting  the  “present”  sample  points  was 
>70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%. The 
model  was  effective,  and  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  model  was 
slightly  greater  than  that  of  the  model  based  on  remote  sensing  data 
without the introduction of nighttime light information.

Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hyperparameters were used in this case.
