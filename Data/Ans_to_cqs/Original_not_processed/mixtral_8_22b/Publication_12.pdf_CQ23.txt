We further improved Waveman by modifying BatNet and opti-
mizing parameter setting of batch size. We add new kind of BNorm
layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting when
we trained models using BatNet (Fig. 2C). Therefore the model
“learned” to generalize from a trend in both “known” and “unknown”
datasets rather than to maximize the performance on the “known”
datasets (usually called training datasets, Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).
Computers can only train with small volumes of images at once as they
have too little Random Access Memory or Graphic memory. Batch size
was set to limit the image number. In this study, we set a large batch
size equal to 128, which means training with 128 images for each
iteration.

rate equaled 1e-3 (only a network called ResNet_v2 was set to 1e-5). We
trained a model using the training dataset (incl. 111,244 images) for
50–60 times using Graphic Processing Unit (GPU, Nvidia 1080ti, US)
for two hours and 10 min. After training the model contained refined
parameters and a graph which were saved for the downstream analysis.

2.2. Testing and further refinements of Waveman

We used filtered data (i.e., validation dataset in which 19,614
images were selected) to test different model and taxon bias. Then we
collected audio-files from a corridor for the 15 species to test how to
lower the misidentification and false positives. Finally, we optimized
the BatNet and collected audio from different human and natural
conditions to test the generalization of the model by recording the same
species under different conditions these audio-files are unfiltered and
were directly imported into Waveman.

2.2.1. Comparison of BatNet and other three networks

currently possible. Furthermore, by automatically including a large
number of different measures and metrics, we enable the application of
the approach to diverse systems, such as tropical ecosystems, with the
ability to discriminate even subtle differences in call structure we can
apply these approaches to any given system once a training dataset has
been developed.

Helpful Answer: To improve the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. First, they modified BatNet and optimized its parameters, specifically adjusting the batch size. They added new kinds of BNorm layers after the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting during training. This modification allowed the model to learn trends in both known and unknown datasets instead of focusing solely on maximizing performance on the training datasets. Second, they increased the batch size to 128, enabling the model to process more images per iteration. Lastly, they tested the model using various datasets, including a validation dataset containing 19,614 images, audio files from a corridor for 15 species, and audio files recorded under different human and natural conditions. These tests helped lower misidentifications and false positives while improving the model's ability to generalize across different environments and conditions.
