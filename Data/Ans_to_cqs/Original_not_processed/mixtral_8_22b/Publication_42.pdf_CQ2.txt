7,047,754 learnable parameters gave a F1-score of 84.93% which is even lower. CNN
architectures with many parameters (more than 20,000,000) such as ResNetV50 [38] and
InceptionNetV3 [39] gave a high training accuracy, but a lower validation F1-score of 69.1%
and 81.7%, respectively. This result indicates overﬁtting and that more training data are
needed when such large deep learning networks are used. A very high F1-score of 96.6%
was ﬁnally achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only
training the output layers. This indicates that the state-of-the-art was able to outperform
our proposed model, but requires pretrained weights with many more parameters.

2.2.4. Summary Statistics

Finally, the customized CNN architectures were compared with selected state-of-
the-art CNN optimized architectures. EfﬁcientNetB0 [36] is scaled to work with a small
image input size of 224 × 224 pixel and has 4,030,358 learnable parameters. Using the
moths dataset with the same data augmentation, the EfﬁcientNetB0 achieved a F1-score
of 88.62%, which is lower than our top ﬁve best architectures. DenceNet121 [37] with

One of the potential sources of error in the algorithm was the choice of dataset used
for training and validation of the CNN model. Collecting a sufﬁciently large dataset with
enough data points for efﬁcient classiﬁcation of the rarer species was a signiﬁcant challenge.
However, it is likely that increasing the number of images available for training the CNN
model could improve performance even further. The current classiﬁcation algorithm relies
heavily on padding the bounding box found during blob segmentation. The performance
of the system changes signiﬁcantly with variation in padding before CNN prediction. The
CNN algorithm was trained on a dataset using manual annotations of the moths. These do
not surround the moths as closely as the bounding boxes placed by the blob segmentation
(see Figures 4 and 6). Thus, there is a difference in the sizes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the information provided that the data format used is most likely images. The text mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are primarily used for processing grid-like topology data, such as images. Additionally, the context discusses EfficientNetB0, which is designed for working with small image inputs. Furthermore, the discussion about collecting sufficient datasets with enough data points for efficient classification of rare species suggests that the data format being referred to is indeed images. Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images.
