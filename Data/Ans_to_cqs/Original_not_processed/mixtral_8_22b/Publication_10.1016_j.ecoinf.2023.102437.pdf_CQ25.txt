The  recurrent  neural  network  (RNN)  model  is  an  artificial  model 
used  for  processing  sequential  data.  RNNs  have  been  successfully 
applied  in  areas  such  as  speech  recognition,  language  models,  and 
translation,  where  the  material  is  continuous.  However,  RNN  have 
limitations  in  processing  past  information  if  there  is  a  considerable 
difference  in  time  duration  between  the  initial  and  final  parts  of  the 
data.  LSTM  (Long  Short-Term  Memory)  is  a  type  of  recurrent  neural 
network (RNN) architecture designed to address some of the limitations 
of  traditional  RNNs  when  it  comes  to  handling  long  sequences  and 
capturing long-term dependencies in data. LSTM networks are used in 
machine learning and deep learning for sequential data tasks, such as 
natural language processing, speech recognition, time series forecasting, 
and  more.  Especially,  LSTM  models  possess  the  ability  to  make  pre-

Machine-learning models have been democratized in environmental 
science  over  the  past  few  years.  Several  ML-based  models  can  be 
grouped  based  on  their  architecture.  The  topic  of  neural  networks  is 
addressed in the following section. In this section, we focus on a model 
based on a tree structure. The RF model, which is based on tree struc-
ture, has been frequently used for ENSO (Gibson et al., 2021; Pal et al., 
2020). We compared its performance in forecasting ENSO with that of 
the  Lasso  model. The RF  models are  often  associated  with “ensemble 
learning,”  which is derived from the aggregation of tree structures or 
trees created during the learning phase RF models. Notably, the number 
of trees was defined downstream, and all our models were composed of 
200 trees.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the references cited, it appears that the deep learning model might be used for forecasting or prediction purposes. Specifically, the paper by Ham, Y.-G., Kim, J.-H., Luo, J.-J. (2019) discusses using deep learning for multi-year ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) forecasts. Additionally, the reference to Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J.H., Friedman, J.H. (2009) suggests that the deep learning model could also be employed for statistical learning, data mining, inference, and prediction. Therefore, without further specific details about the deep learning model discussed in the context, one can only infer that its purpose may involve forecasting, prediction, or other related applications.
