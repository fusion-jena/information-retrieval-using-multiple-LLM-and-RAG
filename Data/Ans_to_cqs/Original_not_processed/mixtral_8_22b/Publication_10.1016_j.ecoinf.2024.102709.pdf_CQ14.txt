split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

To determine the ideal training–test split for our model, we used k- 
fold  cross-validation  (k  = 5,  epochs  = 500,  imagesize  = 640).  The 
epochs provide the number of repetitions for training, and the image size 
is  expressed in  pixels. k-fold  cross-validation  (Rodriguez et  al., 2010) 
was used to determine the best training test set for the model. Hereby, 
the data are split into k different training–test sets. The model was not 
trained on the entire dataset but on each training split. The result was an 
investigation of the best data split. Functions of the Python library scikit- 
learn  (scikit-learn  developers,  2023)  were  used  to  split  the  data  and 
investigate the results of each trained model. In addition, YOLO training 
losses and mAP50 values of each model were investigated. The split with 
the  highest  mAP50  value  indicates  the  highest  number  of  correctly 
predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. We used the

Table  7  depicts  the  six  models  in  greater  detail  by  comparing 
different loss training values, which indicate how well the model learned 
during training. The goal of training was to minimize the loss value. The 
YOLO loss function was divided into three parts (Zafar et al., 2018). 

The box loss is a regression loss that measures the error in the pre-
dicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions relative to the ground 
truth. When the value is lower, the bounding boxes are more accurate (Li 
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). This value is computed by YOLO using 
Intersection  over  Union  (IoU)  (Zheng  et  al.,  2016)  and  distributional 
focal  loss  (DFL)  (X.  Li  et  al.,  2020b).  The  IoU  measures  the  distance 
between the ground truth and the actual box (Zheng et al., 2016). DFL

From the given context, it appears that the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some clues about the methods used for determining the optimal configuration of the model.

Firstly, the use of k-fold cross-validation suggests that the authors employed this technique to evaluate the performance of their model across multiple subsets of the data. K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the data into 'k' folds or partitions, where one fold is held out as a validation set while the remaining folds are used for training. This process is repeated 'k' times, such that each fold serves as the validation set once. By averaging the performance metrics obtained from each iteration, the authors can estimate the overall performance of the model.

Secondly, the mention of epochs implies that the authors used iterative training to improve the accuracy of their model. Epochs refer to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the learning algorithm during training. Each pass through the dataset is called an iteration, and the total number of iterations required to complete one epoch depends on the batch size used for training. By increasing the number of epochs, the authors could potentially improve the convergence of their model towards the global minimum of the loss function.

Lastly, the reference to functions from the Python library scikit-learn suggests that the authors may have utilized various tools available within this library for optimizing the hyperparameters of their model. For instance, they might have used techniques like grid search or random search to systematically explore different combinations of hyperparameter values and identify the ones that yield the best performance. However, without further information, it is difficult to confirm whether these specific methods were indeed applied.
