%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" discusses the use of deep learning models for identifying various bird species based on their vocalizations. However, it does not provide specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The authors mention that they used a diverse dataset consisting of recordings from different habitats and seasons, but there is no information regarding the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to validate the model's performance. Therefore, we cannot determine which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the given context.
