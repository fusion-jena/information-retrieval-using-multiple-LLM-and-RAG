details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention several databases like GBIF, iNaturalist, OBIS, AquaMaps, and a reference to Zhang and Vincent (2018), which could potentially contain relevant data. It would be best to refer to the original source or contact the authors directly for more precise information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
