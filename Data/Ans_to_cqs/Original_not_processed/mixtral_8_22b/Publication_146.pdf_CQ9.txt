Due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own data set for the purpose of
the project. The data set created is, in a deep learning context, still at a relatively small size. However,
testing the model under very diﬃcult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good
detection capabilities, paving the way for future work.

to keep these values. There is some variance in proposed learning rate settings, but studies applying
Yolo to aerial imagery have succeeded with a learning rate of 0.001 [12] and have proven that this value
produces higher precision [20]. The model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, resulting in a total
training time of 27 h. Due to limitations in computer memory, the batch size was set at 4.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that a new dataset was created due to the lack of existing quality data, but it does not provide any details about where this dataset has been made publicly accessible or uploaded to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
