when sampling the fundamentally different population conditions of a

applied for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attri-

to traditional methods to improve our biological understanding in future 
or retrospective research.

In addition to the OOB, the model performance was also evaluated 
using  the  confusion  matrix  with  the  following  metrics:  Cohen’s  kappa 
coefficient (κ) to measure the proportion of agreements (Cohen, 1960), 
Precision to determine proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for 
the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true 
negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the 
proportion  within  each  phase.  Descriptions  of  these  metrics  are  as 
follows: 

κ =

2 × (TP × TN (cid:0) FN × FP)
(TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN)

On each sampled fish, the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) was computed 
as  GSI  = (OW  /  (TW  -  OW))  × 100.  In  addition,  a  measurement  of 
relative condition factor (Krel) was calculated as an indirect measure of 
nutritional status in according to Le Cren (1951), as Krel = TW / (αTL
),

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the study or project. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating various evaluation metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. These metrics help assess the performance of the model and its ability to accurately predict the target variable. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, such as false positives and false negatives. Other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps can be employed to visualize which input features contribute most significantly to the model's output, providing valuable information about feature importance and model interpretability.
