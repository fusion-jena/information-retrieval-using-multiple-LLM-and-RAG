for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides details about the input data layers for the model, including the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), both having a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km. Additionally, it mentions the use of a nine-cell approach to improve prediction results by smoothing out data inaccuracies within individual grid cells. However, without further context regarding the deep learning model itself, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters employed.
