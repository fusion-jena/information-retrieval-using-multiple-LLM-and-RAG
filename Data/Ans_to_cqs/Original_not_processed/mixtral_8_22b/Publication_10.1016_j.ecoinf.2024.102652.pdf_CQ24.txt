2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like k-fold cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability due to random sampling, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve model performance and robustness by reducing the impact of random factors during training.
