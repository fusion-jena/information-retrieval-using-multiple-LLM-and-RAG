Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

5. Conclusions 

Our study investigated the efficacy of active learning as a framework 
for  building deep  learning models  in a  setting  where  limited  training 
data were available and the cost to obtain training data was high. Using 
field  recordings  of  a  threatened  species,  the  southern  black-throated 
finch,  we  successfully  developed  and  demonstrated  the  value  of  an 
open  access  active  learning  method  that  considered  imbalanced  and 
unlabelled data and ambiguous vocalisations, which are common bar-
riers to constructing call recognition models for rare or cryptic species, 
and other species that vocalise infrequently. Our results demonstrate the 
utility of these methods in developing effective call recognisers for rare 
and difficult to survey species.

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found within the context. For instance, Teixeira et al. (2022) discuss nest monitoring of endangered black-cockatoos using bioacoustics and open-source call recognition, suggesting that audio recording devices such as microphones might have been employed for data collection. Similarly, Ross et al. (2023) talk about passive acoustic monitoring, implying the use of sound recording equipment like hydrophones or remote sensing technology. Roh et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive overview of various data collection techniques for machine learning from a big data-AI integration perspective, but they do not specifically focus on the case of this research. Lastly, Ruff et al. (2020, 2021) describe workflows and convolutional neural networks for automated identification of animal sounds, indicating that their studies likely involved gathering audio data through field recordings or similar means. Therefore, while there isn't explicit information regarding the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the given sources, it can be inferred that audio recording devices and possibly remote sensing technologies may have played significant roles in acquiring relevant data for the deep learning pipeline.
