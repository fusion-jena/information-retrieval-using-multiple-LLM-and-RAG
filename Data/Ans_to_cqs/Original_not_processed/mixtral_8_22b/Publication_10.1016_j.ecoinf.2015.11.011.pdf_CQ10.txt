For each site, we aggregated the data at the raster level to a range
of cell sizes and ﬁt models for each cell size. Das et al. (2011) calcu-
lated a tree's neighborhood, “an area big enough to allow at least
two of the largest trees to interact,” based on allometric equations
for tree species in the Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. They
found that a 9-m radius (18-m diameter) was a reasonable area to
“capture local processes affecting trees both large and small.” As
Douglas-ﬁr is a major component in the densest parts of our sites,
as well as a component in Sierran forests studied in Das et al.
(2011), we used 18 m (rounded to 20 m for raster cell sizes) as a min-
imum linear distance to include neighborhood dynamics. Oak spe-
cies are likely to have larger and more variable crown diameters as
well as wider spacing than Douglas-ﬁr and other conifers found in
the Sierra Nevada (Burns and Honkala, 1990), so scales up to 40 or

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or their respective code repositories. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the code repository link of such a pipeline based solely on this text.
