mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Trails  were  collected  from  free-ranging  Amur  tiger,  of  unknown 
identity, at the study sites. Table 2 reports the trail ID collected for each 
trail. As described above (Section 3.1) sub-trails were formed where >10 
footprints existed in any one trail. For example, the table indicates that 
using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, we were able to derive 
four sub-trails. Section 3.5 below explains how the sex classification for 
images and the resulting designations for each trail were made.

A  classification  dendrogram  was  generated  using  the  FIT  pairwise 
comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). The process was iterated multiple times by altering elements 
within  the  model  to  generate  the  fewest  misclassifications  (Li  et  al., 
2018). The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers giving 
100%  accuracy.  This  algorithm  was  then  used  to  classify  the  free-

The equipment required for the implementation of FIT is minimal. A 
basic digital camera (e,g. a Sony CyberShot) or smartphone can capture 
data at a minimum recommended 1600 Ã— 1200 pixels. A metric scale is 
required. Images can be stored on an external or cloud-based drive. A 
standard home-office laptop computer can run the required analyses. In 
areas where human resources are already deployed for monitoring at- 
risk species (eg anti-poaching or community-outreach), data collection 
can be integrated at very little extra cost. In areas where this is not the 
case,  salaries  for  data  collectors  are  required  for  fieldwork,  but  this 
comes with the benefits of community capacity-building. The costs of 
implementing camera-trap or eDNA survey for low density populations 
may be considerably higher but will vary greatly depending on the area 
to be surveyed and local costs. Jewell et al. (2020) offered a qualitative

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be necessary to ensure accurate results. These steps include:

* Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent certain features from dominating others during training due to their larger magnitudes.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the values of input features to bring them into a common range. Standardization is a popular method of scaling, which transforms the feature values to have zero mean and unit variance.
* Cleaning: Preprocessing often includes removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the dataset. This step ensures that the model learns only relevant patterns and does not get confused by irrelevant information.
* Feature engineering: Depending on the problem domain, additional features might need to be created based on existing ones. For instance, polynomial features could be derived from raw inputs to help the model better understand complex relationships among variables.
* Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models require numerical inputs; thus, categorical variables must be converted into numeric form. One-hot encoding is commonly used for this purpose, creating binary vectors representing distinct categories.

These preprocessing techniques aim to improve the quality of input data, making it easier for the deep learning model to extract meaningful patterns and generalize well to unseen examples.
