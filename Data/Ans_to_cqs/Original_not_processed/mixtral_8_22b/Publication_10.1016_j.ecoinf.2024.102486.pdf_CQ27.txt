the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine 
learning  where  the  training  phase  can  readily  be  parallelised  and 
accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose.

classification  of  visual  images  (e.g.  Atila  et  al.,  2021)  or  acoustic  re-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. However, it mentions several popular libraries and frameworks used for developing and training deep learning models, including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and others like the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools often provide functionalities for saving and loading models, which can be useful during the deployment stage. For instance, TensorFlow has built-in functions for saving and restoring models, while PyTorch provides methods for saving and loading entire models or individual components. As for platform selection, the choice depends on various factors such as hardware requirements, scalability needs, and integration with other systems. Some platforms commonly used for deploying deep learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as edge devices for real-time processing.
