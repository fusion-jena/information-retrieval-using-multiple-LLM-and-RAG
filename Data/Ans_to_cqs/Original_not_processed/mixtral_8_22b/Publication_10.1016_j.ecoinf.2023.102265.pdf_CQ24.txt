easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

successful trials in the sample. In our case, the sample size is the number 
of images per species, and a successful trial corresponds to an image in 
the sample having a natural background.

We tested the performance of pre-trained ResNet-18/50/101 models 
by  training  each  with  the  same  500  honey  bee  images.  This  dataset 
contained 250 images of natural backgrounds and 250 anthropogenic 
backgrounds as determined by the manual algorithm. The training times 
for  all  three  models  were  similar,  with  ResNet-50  being  marginally 
faster. A pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model was therefore selected for 
our study, and the last layer before its classification layer was used to 
extract 1000 features for training our classifier model. These features are 
visualised in Fig. 7 using a t-SNE algorithm (Maaten et al., 2008). This is 
a  non-linear  dimensionality  reduction  method  for  visualising  high- 
dimensional data by providing each data-point a location in 2-D or 3- 
D space. In this case it shows that our two classes, natural and anthro-
pogenic microhabitats, are well structured (see Table 1).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variance, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of random initialization. It should also be noted that while randomness can introduce variability, it can sometimes help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Based on the given context, we cannot provide specific details about how the authors handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the helpful answer provides general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines.
