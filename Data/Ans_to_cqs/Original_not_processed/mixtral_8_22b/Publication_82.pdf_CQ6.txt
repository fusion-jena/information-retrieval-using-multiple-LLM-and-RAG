• Momentum: 0.9,
• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

Each of these 60 experiments runs for a total of 30 epochs,
where one epoch is deﬁned as the number of training iterations
in which the particular neural network has completed a full pass
of the whole training set. The choice of 30 epochs was made based
on the empirical observation that in all of these experiments, the
learning always converged well within 30 epochs (as is evident
from the aggregated plots (Figure 3) across all the experiments).
To enable a fair comparison between the results of all the
experimental conﬁgurations, we also tried to standardize the
hyper-parameters across all the experiments, and we used the
following hyper-parameters in all of the experiments:
• Solver type: Stochastic Gradient Descent,
• Base learning rate: 0.005,

• Learning rate policy: Step (decreases by a factor of 10 every

of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, there are some implicit indications about certain aspects of data preparation.

Firstly, the context mentions three types of datasets: color, grayscale, and leaf segmented. This suggests that some form of image processing or conversion might have been applied to generate different versions of the original dataset. Grayscaling involves removing color information from images, while leaf segmentation could involve isolating leaves from their backgrounds in images.

Secondly, the context refers to varying distributions of training and testing sets, ranging from 80-20% to 20-80%. This implies that the raw dataset was divided into separate subsets for training and testing purposes.

Lastly, the context discusses the use of stochastic gradient descent as the solver type, along with other hyperparameters like base learning rate, learning rate policy, momentum, weight decay, gamma, and batch size. While these are not strictly preprocessing steps, they do indicate how the data was handled during the training process.

However, without explicit details regarding normalization, scaling, cleaning, or other common preprocessing techniques, it cannot be definitively stated what preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning models.
