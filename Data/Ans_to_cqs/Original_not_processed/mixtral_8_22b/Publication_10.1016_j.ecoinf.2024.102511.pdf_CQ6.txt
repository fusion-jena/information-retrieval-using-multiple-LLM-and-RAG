Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020;

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, this involves adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting their range or losing information. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Standardization.

3. Cleaning: This step involves handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. Missing values can be filled with mean, median, mode, or other imputation techniques. Outliers can be detected and handled using various statistical methods. Errors in the dataset need to be corrected manually or by using appropriate algorithms.

4. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to predicting the target variable. Some might even degrade the model's performance. Therefore, it's important to select only those features that significantly impact the output. Techniques like correlation matrix, Chi-square test, mutual information, etc., can be used for feature selection.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since most machine learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly, they must be converted into numerical form. One common method is label encoding, where each category is assigned a unique integer value. Another popular technique is one-hot encoding, which converts each category into a binary vector.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, synthetic samples can be generated through transformations such as rotation, zooming, flipping, cropping, etc. This technique is particularly useful when working with images but can also apply to other types of data.
