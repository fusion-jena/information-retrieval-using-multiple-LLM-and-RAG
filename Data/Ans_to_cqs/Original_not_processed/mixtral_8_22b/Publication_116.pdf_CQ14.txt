IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

2) Unbiased Dataset: For each species X in dataset D, we
tried to approximate a 70%-30% distribution as in the Biased
Dataset case. However, in order to avoid the SSPB, we used
the unique specimen identiﬁer to place images from the same
specimen in eiher the training dataset or the testing dataset.
This restriction alone could not be achievable if, for example,
one species X has photos of several leaves but they are all
from the same specimen. Our dataset D was created so that it
precludes such scenario, as there are photos from at least two
different specimens for each species X in dataset D. However,
this restriction clearly makes it harder to approximate the ideal
70%-30% distribution both, at the species level and globally.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others were employed. Further research into related papers or contact with the authors may help clarify this aspect.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the paper focuses more on comparing different approaches to plant identification rather than delving into specific details regarding the optimization techniques used for their models. The experiments conducted involve hand-crafted feature extraction and computer vision pipelines, including deep learning architectures. However, the exact process of selecting optimal hyperparameters remains unclear without additional information.
