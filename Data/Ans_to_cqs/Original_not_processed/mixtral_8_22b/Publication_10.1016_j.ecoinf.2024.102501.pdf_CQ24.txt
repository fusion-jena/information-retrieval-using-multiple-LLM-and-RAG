The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example, 

Models

In  contrast,  deep  learning  methods,  while  powerful,  often  require 
large  datasets  and  substantial  computational  resources.  They  can  be 
prone  to  overfitting,  especially  when  the  available  data  is  limited  or 
noisy, as is often the case in aquaculture environments. be less inter-
pretable, making understanding the underlying decision-making process 
challenging. RNNs, although proficient in handling sequential data, may 
struggle  with  the  complex  and  noisy  environmental  data  typical  in 
aquaculture settings. Additionally, RNNs are more prone to overfitting 
and  may  require  more  computational  resources.  Whereas  attenuation 
mechanism methods might struggle with the multifaceted and dynamic 
nature of the aquaculture system.

for  predicting  DO  concentration  in  rivers,  which  outperformed  the 
M5Tree  and  MARS  models  (Yaseen  et  al.,  2018).  Tree-based  models 
usually include decision trees, random forest (RF), and extreme gradient 
boosting  (XGBoost).  Lu  proposed  a  short-term  DO  prediction  model 
based  on  XGBoost  and  RF,  which  was  applied  to  the  data  after  pre-
processing with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with 
adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)(Lu and Ma, 2020). Heddam used extreme 
randomized  tree  and  RF  to  predict  DO  concentrations  in  the  Charles 
River  and  Mystic  River,  with  better  model  accuracy  than  those  of 
multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) models (Adnan et al., 
2021). Ahmed proposed a quantile regression forest algorithm for pre-
dicting DO levels in three rivers, and the results show that their model

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the given references directly addresses the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage this issue include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value before training the model, one can ensure reproducibility of results across multiple runs. This helps eliminate any variability introduced by the random initialization of weights and other factors.

2. Ensemble methods: Combining predictions from several independently trained models can help reduce the impact of randomness. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking can be used to create ensembles of models, improving overall performance and robustness.

3. Cross-validation: Using k-fold cross-validation during model evaluation allows assessing the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This provides a more reliable estimate of its true performance and reduces the risk of overfitting due to random fluctuations in the data.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters through techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can lead to finding a set of optimal hyperparameters that work well across various random initializations.
