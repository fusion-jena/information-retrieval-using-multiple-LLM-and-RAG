vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the text discuss various aspects of machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to ecology and biodiversity studies but do not provide specific details about the location or accessibility of their respective data repositories. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of this particular deep learning pipeline can be found.
