Table C.2

Surface area as a share of each bioregion (ID) for every SRI category for each of the three grid sizes (R1= ∼ 1
). Values show the surface area as 
a share of each bioregion for every SRI category (see §2.2.1). ID is the identification number given to each bioregion (Table 1). H are cells with a high representativeness 
of species richness (i.e. SRI > 0.85). M are cells considered as having a medium representativeness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0.60, 0.85)). L cells are cells with a low number of records 
and are thus not considered to be representative of actual species richness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0, 0.6)). NR as cells with no records (SRI = NA), and IR as cell with insufficient 
records to apply SRI.

Appendix A. The database 

Table A.1 below shows the data loss for each criterion that we have used to clean our database. We downloaded 71,670,596 records from GBIF and 

OBIS. Only 820,004 records were useful for our analyses.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs were utilized for this purpose based solely on the given context.
