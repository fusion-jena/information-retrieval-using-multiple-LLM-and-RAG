scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its purpose. However, generally speaking, deep learning models can be used for various purposes such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, natural language processing tasks like text generation, translation, sentiment analysis, etc. Without further details about the specific deep learning model mentioned in the paper, we cannot determine its exact purpose.

Based on the provided context, this study focuses on using different machine learning algorithms, including regression techniques and tree-based ensemble methods, to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests. These algorithms include Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forests (RF). The results show that integrating spectral bands with other variable sets, such as those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-derived indices, leads to better outcomes when predicting AGB. Therefore, the purpose of these machine learning models is to accurately estimate AGB in forests by utilizing remote sensing data and other relevant features.
