model (Sowmya et al., 2020). The best model is selected comparing the 
performance scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

(cid:0) 4;  

The following configuration optimized the performance of the model 
and was accordingly adopted for analysis: Adam solver (Kingma and Ba, 
(cid:0) 4,  constant  learning 
2014),  10 neurons  per  hidden  layer, alpha  = 10
rate, and rectifier activation function, also called Rectified Linear Unit 
(ReLU) activation function, defined as:

In the case of the RF, the hyperparameters include the number of 
decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the 
number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. 
This  set  of  hyperparameters  was  tested  using  the  grid  configuration 
shown below:  

1.  Number of decision trees: from 100 to 1000 (in steps of 100);  
2.  Number of features to consider at every split (max features): auto,

sqrt, log2, None;  

3.  Maximum number of levels in decision tree: None, or from 10 to 100 

(in steps of 10);

4.2. Performance evaluation and results

3.3.3. Standardization and performance metrics 

In this work, the dataset was standardized to reduce the influence of 
outliers.  All  features were  normalized  and  scaled so  that they  have  a 
similar  range.  In  particular,  a  standard  score  based  on  the  following 
equation was used: 

(8)  

z =

x (cid:0) μ
σ

(10)  

where x is the real value of the sample, μ is the mean of the population, 
and σ  is  the standard deviation. Using  the standard score all features 
have a zero mean and a unit variance. 

The model performance was evaluated based on three statistical in-
dicators:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  root  mean  square  error 
(RMSE),  and  mean  bias  error  (MBE),  calculated  according  to  the 
following equations:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was standardized to reduce the influence of outliers. This involved normalizing and scaling all features so that they had a similar range. A standard score was used, which ensured that all features had a zero mean and a unit variance.

Secondly, the model's performance was evaluated based on three statistical indicators: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE). These indicators helped assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Lastly, the best model was selected by comparing the performance scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They can significantly impact the model's performance. For instance, in the case of Random Forest (RF), the hyperparameters included the number of decision trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. These hyperparameters were tested using a grid configuration.

However, it should be noted that while these measures help improve the model's generalizability, they do not guarantee it. Other factors such as the diversity of the dataset, use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, etc., also play a crucial role in ensuring the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of these techniques being employed in the given context.
