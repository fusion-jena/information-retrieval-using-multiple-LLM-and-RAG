resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst them. By ignoring certain neurons, the network becomes less sensitive to specific weights in the network and thus generalizes better. Dropout can be applied to any layer in the neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. The goal of L2 regularization is to keep the weights small and avoid overfitting. It encourages the model to spread out the weights across all features rather than depending too much on individual ones.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights to the loss function. Early stopping stops the training process before it converges when the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones, helping the model learn more robust representations.

In summary, regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding penalties to the loss function during training. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
