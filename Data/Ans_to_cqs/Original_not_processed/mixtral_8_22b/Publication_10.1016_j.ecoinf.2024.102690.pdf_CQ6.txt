Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

biodiversity. The habitat maintenance bundle accounted for 32% of the 
total area, mainly constituting woodlands, and was characterized by the 
highest delivery of biodiversity, water conservation, and raw materials, 
whereas it had a moderate delivery of other services.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and the problem being addressed. Some common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or incorrect information from the dataset, such as missing values or outliers. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric variables so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Scaling is another technique used to rescale features to a range between 0 and 1, or -1 and 1. Other preprocessing steps may involve encoding categorical variables, feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. However, the exact preprocessing steps required will depend on the specific application and dataset being used.

Unhelpful Answer:
Preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model typically involve data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. These steps help ensure that the data is properly formatted and ready for use in the model. Additionally, some models may require additional preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables or performing feature engineering. Ultimately, the specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the particular application and dataset being used.
