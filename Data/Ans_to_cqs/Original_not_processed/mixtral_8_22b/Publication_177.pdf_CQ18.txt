minimizing  the  loss  on  the  validation  dataset  to  perform 
objective function evaluations. The models were trained for a 
maximum of 10 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent 
with  a  momentum  (‘sgdm’)  optimizer.  Thus,  a  total  of  six

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The  implementation  of  models  and  ensemble  learning 
methods was performed using the MATLAB R2021a. Based 
on the transfer learning approach, the individual models were 
trained  using  the  six  pre-trained  networks  for  each  dataset.  
The weights for the first 10 layers for each pre-trained network 
were  frozen  and  the  optimization  of  hyperparameters  was 
performed using the Bayesian optimization. The classification 
accuracies  for  validation  and  testing  data  for  UBD_45  and 
VP_200  datasets  are  presented  in  Fig.  4  and  Fig.  5, 
respectively.  For  the  UBD_45  dataset,  all  models  perform 
well with a testing accuracy above 90% except for GoogleNet.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the authors used the validation dataset to minimize the loss. They employed the stochastic gradient descent with momentum ('sgdm') optimizer for this purpose. The models were trained for a maximum of 10 epochs. This strategy allowed them to evaluate the objective function effectively while ensuring optimal performance of their models.
