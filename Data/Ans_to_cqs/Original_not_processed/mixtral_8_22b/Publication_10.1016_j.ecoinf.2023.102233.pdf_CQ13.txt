Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate.

3.1. CNN model development with active learning 

The CNN model performance stabilised within five active learning 
iterations (Fig. 4). The majority of model performance improvement was 
achieved within the first two iterations, with a 34.3% decrease in macro- 
averaged MAE between iterations one and three, compared to a 12.1% 
decrease in macro-averaged MAE between iterations three and the final 
model (Fig. 4). Most of the training data added between iterations one 
and  three  consisted  of  non-target  calls  (Table  1),  which  led  to  rapid 
improvements in the model’s ability to differentiate non-target sounds, 
resulting in a reduction in false positives.

5. Conclusions 

Our study investigated the efficacy of active learning as a framework 
for  building deep  learning models  in a  setting  where  limited  training 
data were available and the cost to obtain training data was high. Using 
field  recordings  of  a  threatened  species,  the  southern  black-throated 
finch,  we  successfully  developed  and  demonstrated  the  value  of  an 
open  access  active  learning  method  that  considered  imbalanced  and 
unlabelled data and ambiguous vocalisations, which are common bar-
riers to constructing call recognition models for rare or cryptic species, 
and other species that vocalise infrequently. Our results demonstrate the 
utility of these methods in developing effective call recognisers for rare 
and difficult to survey species.

Helpful Answer:

In this study, the authors used a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to develop a call recognition system for a threatened species, the southern black-throated finch. They employed an active learning approach to improve their model iteratively.

Regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, the text mentions that they utilized a grid search technique to tune the hyperparameters of the final model. This technique involves testing various combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal set that yields the best performance.

Specifically, the authors mention that they tuned the following hyperparameters:

1. Number of epochs: Ten epochs were used during the active learning iterations. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this was also the case for the final model after applying the grid search technique.

2. Batch size: A batch size of 64 was used during the active learning iterations. Similar to the number of epochs, it is unclear if this remained the same for the final model.

3. Learning rate: The initial learning rate used during the active learning iterations was 0.001. Again, there is no explicit information about any changes made to the learning rate when fine-tuning the final model.

Unfortunately, the given context does not provide details regarding the specific optimizer used in the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the provided information, I can only confirm that the hyperparameters mentioned above were adjusted during the process of developing the final model.
