The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiÔ¨Åc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning, was used to develop the species richness estimation model. This implies that the development and possibly deployment could have been done locally without relying on any major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
