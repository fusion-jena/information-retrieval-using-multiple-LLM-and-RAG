cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

and left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which reduced 
the  issue  of  overfitting,  and  strengthened  the  algorithms  capacity  to 
match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. 
The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For instance, the paper mentions using "data augmentation techniques" such as "left-right mirroring," which are commonly employed when working with image data in CNNs. Additionally, one of the cited papers discusses an "automated vertebrate animals classification using deep convolution neural networks." This further supports the idea that CNNs might be involved in the pipeline. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated that CNNs are the only deep learning model used in the pipeline.
