easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

ResNet-50 is made up of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of 
one  another  (Fig.  5).  The  image  features  are  extracted  from  the  fully 
connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database (https://imag 
e-net.org/index.php). The input to the network is an image of 224x224

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was utilized.
