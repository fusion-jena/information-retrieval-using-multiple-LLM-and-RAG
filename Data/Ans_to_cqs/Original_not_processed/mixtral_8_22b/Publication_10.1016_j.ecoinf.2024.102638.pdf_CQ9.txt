The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the data is semi-hourly and comes from various sources such as Soil Moisture Probes, Radiation Stations, and Eddy Covariance Stations. However, without further details or references, we cannot determine the exact location of the data repository.
