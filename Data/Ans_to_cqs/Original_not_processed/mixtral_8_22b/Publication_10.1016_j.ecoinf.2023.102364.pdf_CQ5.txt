information system (GIS) platform and then added 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U. 
S. Census data. We trained, tested, and evaluated the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models, 
resulting in predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots, at 100-m resolution for inference. We find that 
Short-billed Gulls prefer the synergy of industrial areas near man-made water bodies, impervious surfaces, gravel 
pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps) and some young forest vegetation. This study is a first-known 
attempt  to  utilize  a  blended  ‘Big  Data’  approach,  in  combination  with  traditional  multi-year  field-based data 
collection and alternative model assessments, in order to characterize an urban seabird niche. Our findings, and 
the digital infrastructure herein, provide an interdisciplinary baseline for potential applications in urban plan-
ning and monitoring the spread of disease reservoirs.

2.3. Machine learning ensembles 

We  used  the  combined  2014–2015  Short-billed  Gull  presence/ 
absence data cube to train an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models 
in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3 (Formula 1). We used several 
established and leading ML algorithms (Hegel et al., 2010; Fern´andez- 
Delgado et al., 2014 for overview) and combined them in an averaged 
ensemble to obtain the best-possible prediction and overall synergy from 
each algorithm best as possible (sensu J. Friedman ‘many weak learners 
make for a strong learner’; Friedman, 2002, Hastie et al., 2009. See also 
Hardy et al., 2011, Fox et al., 2017 and Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2022 
for applications). That approach will overcome stand-alone approaches 
such  as  linear  regression,  which  do  not  offer  unique  solutions,  e.g. 
Ascombe’s Quartet, and have difficulty to meet all required parametric 
assumptions (McArdle, 1988). The specific algorithms and their settings 
are described below.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not mention any use of image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses a dataset containing 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence data along with 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic US Census data. These datasets were used to train an ensemble of machine learning models in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3. The goal was to create predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots at a 100-m resolution for inference.
