Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

BirdVox-DCASE-10 h (BV-Training set): The BV dataset was pro-
duced  as  part  of  the  BirdVox  project  Website  of  the  BirdVox  project: 
WebsiteoftheBirdVoxproject:\url{https://wp.nyu.edu/birdvox},  whose 
goal  is  to  monitor  bird  migration  with  autonomous  recording  units 
(Lostanlen et al., 2018). The recordings were obtained in four locations 
of Tompkins County, NY, US, during the 2015 fall migration season. An 
expert  ornithologist,  Andrew  Farnsworth,  has  annotated  2662  flight 
calls  from  11  species  of  passerines,  e.g.,  Swainson’s  thrush  (Catharus 
ustulatus)  and  White-throated  sparrow  (Zonotrichia  albicollis.  These 
flight  calls  have  a  duration  in  the  range  50–150  milliseconds  and  a 
fundamental frequency in the range 2–10 kHz.

• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models used for bird call classification. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the exact steps taken for model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspects related to the deployment of these models. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it is common practice to serialize the model using popular formats such as ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, or HDF5. Once serialized, the model can be deployed on various platforms depending on the use case requirements. For instance, edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson might be suitable for real-time applications, while cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure could be more appropriate for larger scale processing needs. Again, without further context, this is only speculation and may not reflect the actual practices employed in the BirdVox project.
