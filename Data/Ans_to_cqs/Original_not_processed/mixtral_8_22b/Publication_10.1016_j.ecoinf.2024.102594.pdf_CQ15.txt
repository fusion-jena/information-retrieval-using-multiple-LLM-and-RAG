3.1. DeepLabV3+ algorithm 

DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which 
is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family (Scepanovic et al., 
2021).  In  the  encoding  stage,  DeepLabV3+ introduces  dilated  convo-
lutions,  which expands  the  receptive field  without losing information 
(Fig.  3).  The  Atrous  spatial  pyramid  pooling  module  with  dilated 
convolution  has  been  mainly  designed  to  appropriately  incorporate 
multi-scale information. During decoding, it is capable of enhancing the 
accuracy  of  segmentation  boundaries  by  further  integrating  low-level 
features with high-level features (Liu et al., 2021a).

DeepLabV3+ algorithm was developed by the PyTorch (1.12.1) li-
brary,  using  the  Python  (3.9)  programming  language  in  the  present 
investigation. Xception was chosen as the backbone network (Li et al., 
2022),  and  dilated  convolutions  with  different  dilation  rates  were 
employed for feature extraction. The selected loss function was Cross-
EntropyLoss with an initial learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 4, and 
epochs  of  150  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022).  In  selecting  the  optimizer  and 
learning rate adjustment strategies, this study compared the SGD and 
Adam algorithms and experimented approach with various strategies, 
including  StepLR,  CosineAnnealingLR,  and  ReduceLROnPlateau. 
Finally, it was found that utilizing Adam in combination with Reduc-
eLROnPlateau could accelerate the convergence rate of model training 
and effectively reduce the risk of overfitting. The operating principle of

ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, two optimization techniques are mentioned for use in the deep learning pipeline - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques are used to update the weights of the neurons in the neural network during the training phase.

The authors compare these two optimization techniques and find that using Adam in conjunction with ReduceLROnPlateau can speed up the convergence rate of model training and effectively mitigate the risk of overfitting. This means that Adam is more effective than SGD in updating the weights of the neurons in the neural network.

ReduceLROnPlateau is a technique used to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the performance of the model. It reduces the learning rate when the validation loss stops decreasing for a certain number of epochs. In this case, if the validation loss does not decrease after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. If there is still no decrease in the validation loss after ten consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped.

Therefore, the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline in this context are Adam and ReduceLROnPlateau.
