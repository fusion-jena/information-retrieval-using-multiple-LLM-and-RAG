hyperparameters  in  a  model.  It  identifies  the  most  effective  set  of 
hyperparameters  that  enhance  the  model's  performance.  During 
training,  GSCV  generates  a  series  of  models,  each  characterized  by  a 
different  set  of  hyperparameters.  The  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
systematically train and assess the performance of these various models 
through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the 
model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by 
its optimal hyperparameter combination (Adnan et al., 2022). Details of 
the primary tuning parameters, their range and the optimal combination 
of  hyperparameters  utilized  for  each  algorithm  for  each  model  are 
shown in Table 1.

2.6. Modeling algorithms and ensemble analysis

To assess the performance of the models, k-fold cross-validation was 
employed,  a  widely  used  evaluation  method  in  machine  learning 
(Anguita et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2022; Yadav and Shukla, 2016). This 
technique has proven to be valuable in machine learning for estimation 
and aids in preventing overfitting by dividing the dataset into k subsets. 
Some of these subsets are used for training the model, while the others 
are utilized to evaluate its performance. In the present study, a 10-fold 
cross-validation  design  was  employed  as  per  Tyralis  et  al.  (2019b). 
The  dataset,  consisting  of  138  ground-based  AGB  estimates  (after 
eliminating outliers), was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset 
was designated for model training while the remaining 30% was used as 
testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a 
sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset

Helpful Answer:
During the training phase, Grid Search Cross Validation (GSCV) is employed to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters that can improve the model's performance. GSCV generates a series of models, each having different sets of hyperparameters. These models undergo systematic training and assessment through cross-validation. The ultimate goal is to select the best performing model based on its optimal hyperparameter combination. In this case, a 10-fold cross-validation design was adopted, where the dataset was divided into two parts - 70% for model training and 30% for testing purposes. This approach ensures sufficient data for training the model and provides an independent dataset for evaluating its performance.
