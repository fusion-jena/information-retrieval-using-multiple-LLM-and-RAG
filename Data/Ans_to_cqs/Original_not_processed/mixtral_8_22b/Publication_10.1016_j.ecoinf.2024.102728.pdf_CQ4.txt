2.2. Data sources

There were two main data sources assembled within a database and
used for the fieldwork/analysis: (1) archaeological survey data from the
Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) (Dagan, 2006) for LTA-LU; and (2)
remotely sensed data (spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-
toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENμS), airborne Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for LC. Addi-
tional ancillary data was required for establishing research control,
georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas, including (1) digital maps
from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC (M.O.
A., 2023); (2) georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of
Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area (S.O.I.,
2018); (3) substrate data for geology, from the Israel geological survey
(I.G.S., 2010, 2016), and soil (Ravikovitch, 1969); (4) climate-related
data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S., 2023) and the US

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise or blurring images. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization.
