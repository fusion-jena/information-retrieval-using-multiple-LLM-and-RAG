Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

2.2. Feature extraction 

To  solve  problems  using  the  machine  learning  method,  extracting 
features from the raw data to be used as inputs for the machine learning 
model is necessary. Although the importance of feature extraction has 
decreased with the introduction of deep learning, there are still aspects 
where features play a key role, such as considering the computing power 
of devices, reducing training time, and ensuring real-time performance 
in decision-making. 

In  this paper,  we used  the BLS  entropy profile to  characterize the 
swimming behavior of C. elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). 
The BLS profile has also been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, 
an indicator of how similar two sequences are, in order to illuminate the 
similarities  and  differences  in  swimming  patterns  of  C.  elegans  in  a 
controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment (Kang et al.,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot give a direct answer to your query. However, generally speaking, some commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, and key point annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the type of dataset and problem being addressed. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is useful for pixel-level classification tasks. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects within an image. Polygon annotation is typically used for irregularly shaped objects, whereas landmark and key point annotations are employed for facial recognition and pose estimation tasks.
