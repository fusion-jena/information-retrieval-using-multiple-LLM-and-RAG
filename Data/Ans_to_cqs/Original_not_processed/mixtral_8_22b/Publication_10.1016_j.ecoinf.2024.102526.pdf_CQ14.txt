Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Planned type of quantification 

Planned derived metrics (e.g., 
abundance, diversity, biomass, 
frequency/rate) 
Description of desired statistical 
comparisons (including sample 
units, replicates, etc.) 
A description / definition of the 
planned spatial extent of the study 
(inside which the photographs were 
captured), including boundaries and 
reasons for constraints (e.g. 
scientific, practical), may connect to 
‘target habitat’ below 
Survey bounding box 

A description / definition of the 
planned temporal extent, including 
boundaries, rationale for duration/ 
frequency, and reasons for 
constraints (e.g. scientific, practical) 
Survey bounding dates and times 

Image or frame interval 
A description, delineation, and 
definition of the habitat or 
environment of study  
Benthic / bentho-pelagic / pelagic 

Type of imagery 
Location of specimens when 
photographed 
Number of cameras, including stereo 
cameras

Set of attributes for target population definition, incorporating some existing iFDO fields and proposing new ones (indicated by *). Indicated mapping to DarwinCore 
terms (‘MachineObservation’ data type), and Ecological Metadata Language terms. Multiple fields map to the DarwinCore ‘samplingProtocol’ term, but may alter-
natively be stored using the ExtendedMeasurementOrFact approach; likewise, in Ecological Metadata Language many fields map to ‘sampling’.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of a model are optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they use techniques such as grid search, random search, or other optimization methods.
