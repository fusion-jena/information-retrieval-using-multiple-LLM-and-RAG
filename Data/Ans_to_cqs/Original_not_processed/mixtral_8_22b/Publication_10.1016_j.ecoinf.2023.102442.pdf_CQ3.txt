2.2. Data and platforms 

The initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine 
(GEE),  a  cloud  processing  platform  which  provides  a  public  catalog 
containing  petabytes  of  satellite  imagery  and  geospatial  datasets, 
allowing for high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and 
analysis  of  images.  The  platform  allows  for  access,  selection,  and

et al., 2017).

their data-fusion reclassification approach was applied. Using CART on 
the  GEE  platform,  Lobo  et  al.  (2018)  reported  an  accuracy  of  74.5% 
(80% producer accuracy, 69% user accuracy).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or classification technique might have been employed due to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) mentioned in one of the papers. CNNs typically require labeled training data, such as bounding boxes or pixel-level masks for object detection or semantic segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact data annotation techniques were utilized in this case.
