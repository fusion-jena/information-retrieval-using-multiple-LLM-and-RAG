processing compared to traditional boosting models (Chen and Guestrin,
2016). XGB typically operates 10 times faster than gradient boost
models and better handles multiple different datasets. LGB efficiently
implements gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) with two new
techniques: gradient-based one-sided sampling and exclusive feature
bundling (Ke et al., 2017). LGB operates >20 times faster than tradi-
tional GBDT models without sacrificing accuracy. CAT automatically
transforms categorical variables to numerical variables for gradient
boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). CAT also solves the overfitting
problem and improves the learning speed of gradient boosting. MLP, an
artificial neural network that stacks multiple layers of perceptrons
(Goodfellow et al., 2016), makes no prior assumptions on the data dis-
tribution and robustly learns nonlinear relationships between the input
features and class labels. LR is a probabilistic model that predicts the

Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to environmental factors and river health prediction, which suggests that the data might include geospatial or hydrological data. Additionally, references to machine learning and deep learning models imply that structured data such as CSV files could be utilized. Without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are employed in the deep learning pipeline.
