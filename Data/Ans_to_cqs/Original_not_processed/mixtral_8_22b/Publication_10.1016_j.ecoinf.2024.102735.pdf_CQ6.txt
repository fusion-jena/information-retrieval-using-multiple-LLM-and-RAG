3. Methodology

To provide clarity, this section begins with a brief overview of the
methodology which includes each objective and the sequential steps
undertaken to achieve them, followed by a detailed explanation of the
methods employed for each objective.

3.1. Overview of methodology

Objective 1
This objective involves the development of multiple machine-
learning models using randomized subsets of training data to estimate

effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions.

While the overall methodology is shown in the flowchart in Fig. 2,
this section provides the general outline of the methodology adopted to
address objective 1.

I. Data Acquisition

i. High frequency (e.g., 15 min) continuous surface water
quality data (e.g., pH, turbidity) were acquired from water
quality sensors-YSI profiler deployed in Boyd Millpond by the
Land Development Division of Greenville County, SC.

Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

included during the model training phase when introducing high-
frequency datasets. This is unsurprisingly as dataset size is often line-
arly related to number of regression trees required to build the models
(Biau and Scornet, 2016). This will enable the RF model to learn more
patterns
in the water quality datasets efficiently and improve
chlorophyll-a predictions. The most occurring max_depth when using
the manually sampled dataset was 28, which increased to 37 when more
datasets were used to train the model. Deeper trees in the continuous
high frequency data allows the model to learn intrinsic water quality
patterns. Less deep trees in the manually sampled datasets helps the
model to learn effectively with the few datasets without overfitting. The
inclusion of the chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable made
little impact on the parameter distribution for both RF_with_Sensor and
RF_w/o_Sensor (Fig. 5). This suggests that increasing predictor numbers

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data acquisition and processing must have occurred given that the authors use high-frequency continuous surface water quality data. Typically, preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, handling missing or inconsistent data points, normalizing or standardizing features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. In this case, the authors do mention that they used randomized subsets of training data, suggesting that their dataset might have undergone partitioning. Additionally, since the authors discuss the effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions, it could imply that they took measures to address these uncertainties during preprocessing. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing techniques applied, one cannot definitively determine what specific steps were undertaken prior to training the deep learning models.
