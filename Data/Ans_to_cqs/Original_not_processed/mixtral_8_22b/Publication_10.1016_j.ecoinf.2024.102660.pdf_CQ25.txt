network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the 
model  accuracy  during  the  training  phase,  and  356  image  pairs  for 
testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

The proposed network was compared on the WSGD test dataset with 
the current state of the art model: UNet used by Giles(Giles et al., 2021) 
and seed pixel region growing used by Chong (Chong et al., 2022), and 
several  classic  semantic  segmentation  networks  (PSPNet,  HRNet  and 
UNet++). The quantitative results of the neural network are shown in 
Table  2,  and  the  qualitative  results  of  the  seed  pixel  region  growing 
algorithm and the neural network are shown in Fig. 7. 

It can be concluded from the table above, the Res_AUNet network 
achieved  the  best  performance,  followed  by  UNet  and  UNet++ net-
works. The F1-score of UNet++ network reached 0.8107, IOU reached 
0.7124, while HRNet and PSPNet had the worst performance, with an 
Accuracy of less than 70%.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this study is semantic segmentation. Specifically, it aims to detect water sun glint in UAV water images. The authors propose a new network called Res_AUNet, which is based on the UNet architecture but enhanced with additional components such as the Convolutional Block Attention Module and residual structures. The goal is to improve the ability of the network to accurately identify areas affected by water sun glint, which can negatively impact the quality of UAV imagery. The Res_AUNet network was trained and tested using the WSGD dataset, achieving high levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and intersection over union (IOU). It outperformed several other popular semantic segmentation networks, including UNet, UNet++, PSPNet, and HRNet. Overall, the main objective of this research is to develop a more effective method for identifying and removing water sun glint from UAV water images, thereby improving their usefulness for various applications.
