Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

2.3.4. Bayesian optimization

p(D)

Probabilistic proxy models are used to estimate the prediction error
of the LSTM model with various hyper parameters. Through iterative
computation of BO and a constant correction of the prior probabilities,
the agent model will closely approximate location objective functions. In
this study, Gaussian processes are selected as the probabilistic agent
model, which is widely employed in non-linear regression, classifica-
tion, and other fields (Seeger, 2004). The Gaussian distribution is
expressed as:

f(x) ∼ GP(μ(x) , k(x, x) )

(10)

where μ(x) = E(f(x)) is the mathematical expectation of f(x), usually the
mean function is set to 0; f(x) is the mean absolute error; k(x, x) is the
covariance function of x.

2.3.5. Model evaluation

To assess the model’s performance, the root mean square error
(RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination
(R2) were used. The definitions of these evaluation metrics are provided

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help determine how well the model has learned from the data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Feature Importance Analysis: Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values can be used to understand the importance of each input feature towards the final output of the model. This helps identify which features contribute most significantly to the predictions made by the model.

3. Visualization Tools: Various visualization tools can be used to better understand the behavior of the model. For example, saliency maps can highlight important regions within images that influence the model's decision-making process. Similarly, confusion matrices can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model during classification tasks.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may also involve fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model using techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Grid Search to further improve its performance.

5. Ensemble Methods: Multiple models can be combined through ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., to create a more robust and accurate predictive system.

These postprocessing steps play a crucial role in ensuring that the trained model meets the desired objectives and performs optimally when deployed in real-world scenarios.
