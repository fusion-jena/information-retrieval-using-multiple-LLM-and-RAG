model with training parameter matrix Wo. The multi-head self-attention 
mechanism makes the model capable of learning the sequence and po-
sitional information in various representations.

3.3. Experimental setup 

The system configuration used for training and experiments of the 
proposed model is given in Table 2. The proposed model EMViT-Net uses 
a kernel of size 3 and strides with size 1 for feature extraction from the 
convolutional  layer  and  generates  enriched  feature  spaces. To  reduce 
the size of extracted feature space max-pooling and average pooling are 
applied to look up the maximum and average value of generated feature 
spaces. To illustrate the point-wise and depth-wise combination of local 
convolutional  features  a  separable  convolutional  parameter-sharing 
attention block is added and batch normalization is applied to ensure 
the stable training and faster convergence of the proposed model. 

3.4. Performance evaluation

b)  Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization 
are  performed  to  address  the  diversity  of  training  data  and  data 
imbalance problems in classification tasks.  

c)  The preprocessed images are fed to the transformer-based network 
EMViT-Net for extracting the both local and global features of mi-
crobes from EM images.  

d)  The integration of the SCPSA block in the CNN module of the EMViT- 
Net makes the model more efficient in extracting depth-wise features 
from the images.  

e)  The  extracted  features  are  then  given  to  a  multilayer  perceptron 

module for final feature fusion and classification.  

f)  Finally, the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is evaluated on 
unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics 
accuracy, precision, recall and f1-Score.

performance  of  the  architecture  and  a  residual  connection  is  applied 
after the block to upgrade the performance of the network by skipping 
some  connections  to  reach  the  final  output  layer.  The  output  of  the 
transformer is used to create feature vectors which are given to the MLP 
module for feature fusion and to make the final classification.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net model. These include:

1. Calculating performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated using unseen test sets of the dataset to assess the overall performance of the model.

2. Feature fusion and classification: Extracted features from the microbe images are passed through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) module for final feature fusion and classification. This step helps in making the final predictions based on the learned features.

3. Residual connections: A residual connection is applied after the transformer block to improve the performance of the network. By skipping some connections, this technique allows the network to reach the final output layer more efficiently.

However, it should be noted that the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, these methods may not necessarily apply to the EMViT-Net model described here.
