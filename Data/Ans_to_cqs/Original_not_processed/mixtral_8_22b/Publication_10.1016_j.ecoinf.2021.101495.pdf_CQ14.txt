model 1. However, model 1 is superior to model 2 where for YFT which 
is the only species where model 1 has more training data than model 2. 
Analyzing both models and Table 4 at the same time, looks like accuracy 
is dependent on the number of training segments per species and not 
dependent on the dataset itself.

obtained through a port sampling program. This sampling strategy for 
estimating the composition of catches by species and sizes in the purse 
seine tropical tuna fisheries was established in 1998, and although it has 
been  slightly  adapted,  it  is  still  used  today  by  European  scientists 
(Duparc et al., 2019). When a tuna vessel arrives at port, sampling be-
gins with the selection of the well to be sampled. Although some wells 
may contain catches from different sets, those that store catches from a 
single  set  are  prioritized.  For  each  well  selected,  a  sample  of  500  in-
dividuals  is  randomly  selected  and  sampled  (i.e.,  species  id  and  size 
measurement). Sampling is conducted during the routine fish landing 
process in two batches while it is still frozen: 300 individuals first and 
200 individuals one hour after the first batch. The measurements taken 
at port are made either to FL if the fish is small or to LD1 otherwise.

Helpful Answer:
The table titled "Hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network" provides information about the search spaces for various hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, learning rate, activation function, and train/test split ratio. It also lists the best assignments for these hyperparameters. However, the method used to find these optimal values is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot definitively determine whether techniques like grid search, random search, or manual tuning were employed to optimize the hyperparameters.
