Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

We used the R package glmmTMB (Magnusson et al., 2017) to fit the 
model, and the R package DHARMa (Hartig, 2022) to evaluate the fit of 
the GLMM. The DHARMa package uses simulation-based dispersion and 
outlier  tests  to  assess  goodness-of-fit.  Beta  coefficients  and  standard 
errors  from  the  fitted GLMM  were then  used  to create  confidence  in-
tervals for each permutation of classification outcome and treatment, as 
discussed in the following section.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the final dataset consisted of 6936 tagging events under three treatments, which suggests some level of diversity in the dataset. Furthermore, the use of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) indicates that the researchers considered random effects in their analysis, potentially accounting for variability within the dataset. Lastly, the use of the R packages glmmTMB and DHARMa to fit the model and evaluate its goodness-of-fit also implies rigorous statistical testing to validate the results. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the dataset composition and preprocessing steps, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
