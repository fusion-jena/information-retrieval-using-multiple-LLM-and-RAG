cles, autonomous vehicles, and surface vessels have been deployed for 
the  offshore  industries  and  deep-sea  archaeology,  ocean  engineering 
projects, rescue operations and environmental measurements for the last 
several  decades.  For  instance,  the  Argo  program,  an  international 
collaboration,  has  deployed  approximately  3900  instruments  in  the 
world's oceans to facilitate the collection of data for climatological and 
oceanographic studies. (Riser et al., 2016). Besides, artificial structures

using supervised approaches (e.g., (Kuru et al., 2023)) to help evaluate 
the  maritime  industry  and  natural  ecosystem  together  within  well- 
prepared  models.  We  aim  to  incorporate  the  built  methodology  with 
camera  systems  used  in  aeroplanes  and  unmanned  aerial  vehicles 
(UAVs) and to employ it in real-time rescue missions on high seas and 
open oceans as a future work, in particular, after aeroplane crashes and 
maritime accidents to find wreckages and survivals.
