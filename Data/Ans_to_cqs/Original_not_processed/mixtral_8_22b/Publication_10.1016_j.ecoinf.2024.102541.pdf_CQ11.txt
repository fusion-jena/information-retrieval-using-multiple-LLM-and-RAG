Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.1.1. Backbone network 

The YOLOv5s model, a standout in computer vision, excels in various 
applications with its convolutional layer backbone, adept at extracting 
high-level image features. This backbone, based on CSPDarknet53 and 
shown in Fig. 2(a), improves upon Darknet53 from YOLOv3 (Redmon 
and Farhadi, 2018) to ensure efficient information processing. This led 
to the reengineering of the YOLOv5s backbone (Fig. 2(b)), enhancing its 
efficiency and reducing computational demands. The modified model is 
both  versatile  and  lightweight,  blending  the  precision  of  computer 
vision with ecological research needs. Subsequent subsections detail the
