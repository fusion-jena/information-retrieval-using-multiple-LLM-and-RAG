EfficientNet-B5  feature  extractor  [27].  EfficientNet  is  a 
CNN  developed  by  Google,  characterized  by  high  accu-
racy  and  computational  efficiency.  Model-2  was  initial-
ized  by  pre-trained  weights  based  on  the  Imagenet  data 
set  [28].  All  the  parameters  were  optimized  using  the 
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

Training

An  Nvidia  GeForce  RTX  2060  GPU  was  used  for  train-
ing,  with  a  batch  size  of  8.  Model-1  (without  feature 
extractor)  was  trained  for  7  h  and  Model-2  (with  a  fea-
ture  extractor)  for  17  h.  Based  on  the  model’s  perfor-
mance on the validation set, the early stopping technique 
was  applied  to  avoid  over-fitting.  Model-2,  which  used 

pre-trained  weights  and  thus  some  prior  relevant  infor-
mation, converged faster than Model-1 (Fig. 3).

Model evaluation: testing

The  Model-K  architecture  is  a  regression  model  based 
on  VGG16  without  the  feature  extractor  on  top.  The 
output layer was flattened and given as input to 2 fully 
connected  (FC)  layers  with  linear  output.  The  regres-
sion  model  was  designed  to  predict  classwise  (five 
categories)  count.  To  compare  it  with  the  proposed 
solution,  we  modify  the  model  by  connecting  the  out-
put  layer  with  a  fully  connected  one  output  neuron. 
Model-K  was  initialized  with  pre-trained  Imagenet 
weights  and  then  trained  using  our  training  data  set 
with  a  Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  optimizer 
and  an  MSE  loss  function.  The  proposed  Model-2 
with  EfficientNet  feature  extractor  reached  an  RMSE 
value  of  1.88  and  0.60  for  the  SLL  and  elephants’  data 
sets,  respectively,  performing  better  than  the  Model-K 
with  an  RMSE  of  2.17  and  0.81  for  SSL  and  elephants’

In  the  proposed  work,  the  down-sampling  (contract-
ing)  path  repeatedly  applies  a  block  comprised  of  two 
3 × 3  convolutions,  followed  by  batch-normalization, 
a  Rectified  Linear  Unit  (ReLU)  activation  and  a  2 × 2 
max-pooling  layer  of  stride  2.  The  number  of  feature 
map  channels  in  the  contracting  path  is  doubled  at 
each  down-sampling  block.  Similarly,  the  up-sampling 
(expansive)  path  replaces  the  max-pooling  layers  with 
up-sampling layers that apply nearest-neighbor interpo-
lation.  Analogous  to  the  contracting  path,  the  number 
of  feature  map  channels  is  halved  at  each  up-sampling 
block.  The  feature  maps  of  the  up-sampling  path  are 
concatenated  with  the  feature  maps  of  the  contracting 
path. Finally, the output layer results by applying a 1 × 1 
convolution.

Loss function

layers  of  the  DL  models  employed.  Specifically,  the 
feed-forward  regression  networks  in  [11,  26]  compress 
and  encode  images  into  smaller  representation  vectors, 
while the combination of CCNN and ResNeXt models in 
[11]  takes  an  input  image  of  size 72 × 72  and  produces 
an  output  density  map  of  size  18 × 18 .  To  overcome 
this  potential  information  loss,  the  UNet  model  was 
employed  as  the  learning  model  [24].  UNet  is  a  CNN 
architecture  originally  proposed  for  biomedical  image 
segmentation,  based  on  an  encoder–decoder-type  net-
work.  The  name  of  the  architecture  is  derived  from  its 
distinctive ‘U’ shape. The down-sampling/encoder block 
encodes the input images into feature representations at 
multiple  level,  capturing  the  context  information  from 
the  image. The  up-sampling/decoder  block  decodes  the 
feature  maps  learned  from  the  encoder.  The  symmet-

Helpful Answer:
Answer: In the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. This optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.001 to optimize all the parameters. Additionally, the early stopping technique is applied to avoid overfitting, based on the model's performance on the validation set.
