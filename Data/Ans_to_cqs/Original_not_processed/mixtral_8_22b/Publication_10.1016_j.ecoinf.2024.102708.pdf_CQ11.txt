2.4. Deep learning models 

Two  widely  used  object  detection  models  were  selected  for  com-
parison, YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2021) and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN) (Ren 
et al., 2015). YOLO is a lightweight approach where objects are identi-
fied directly through as single pass, whereas the FR-CNN is a multi-stage 
network approach based on identifying potential regions and then cat-
egorising and discarding some inappropriate regions (Ren et al., 2015). 
For the YOLOv5 model, we also tested three variants, YOLOv5 small, 
YOLOv5  medium  and  TPH-YOLOv5  (Zhu  et  al.,  2021b),  which  is  a 
modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH) 
(Yang et al., 2019).

As three of our models are based on the YOLO structure, we would 
expect the results to be relatively similar, and the results demonstrate 
the success on small training data quantities compared to larger model 
complexity. Intuitively, it would be expected that a smaller model can 
successfully learn from fewer data to represent less complex problems, 
whereas larger more complex models may require more data to repre-
sent more complexity within the object to detect. The results indicated 
that YOLOv5s, as the smallest model, performs best in terms of preci-
sion. The TPH-YOLOv5, which is an extension of the YOLOv5s model is a 
slightly more complex model, and further pre-training on RPAS specific 
imagery. The results indicated that detection of Pacific oysters does not 
demand  the  complexity  of  the  larger  YOLOv5m  model  and  using  the 
TPH-YOLOv5 model pre-trained with RPAS data, is not beneficial in this 
instance.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository containing the deep learning pipeline. However, the article mentions two popular object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, which have been applied to identify invasive Pacific oysters using drones and remote sensing techniques. These models are open source and their code repositories can be found online. For instance, YOLOv5 can be accessed via GitHub (<https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>) and Faster R-CNN can be found in TensorFlow's Object Detection API (<https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>). It is possible that the authors might have shared their customized versions or modifications of these models along with their dataset in a public repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without additional information, it cannot be confirmed.
