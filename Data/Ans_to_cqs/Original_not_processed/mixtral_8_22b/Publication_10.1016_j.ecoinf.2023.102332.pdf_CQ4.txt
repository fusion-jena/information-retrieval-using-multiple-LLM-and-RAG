different  language  communities  perceive  landscape  features  during 
recreational activities. Yet we need to emphasize that word-sense am-
biguity issues caused certain misclassification but have occurred very 
sporadically and were easily noticeable in the manual checking. How-
ever, these NLP algorithms are expected to improve in the future, pri-
marily  by  including  textual  data  from  social  media  (Gugulica  and 
Burghardt, 2023) or applying the emerging transformer-based models, 
for  example,  the  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Trans-
formers  (BERT)  that  have  been  shown  as  a  promising  tool  for  text 
classification (Devlin et al., 2018; Hunter et al., 2023).

Word2vec  is  a  widely  known  word  embedding  technique  (e.g., 
Mikolov et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), and has been a successful tool for 
investigating CES from social media data (e.g., Gugulica and Burghardt, 
2023).  Word2vec  can  be  carried  out  in  two  ways:  by  creating  and 
training your own word2vec space based on two different architectures, 
namely, Skip-gram, which predicts the target word based on a nearby 
word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which learns to predict a 
target word according to its context (Mikolov et al., 2013), or by using 
pre-trained  models (e.g.,  Baroni et al., 2014). Training a new  custom 
word2vec model requires a very large dataset, increases the computa-
tional effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data. 
Therefore,  we  performed  the  semantic  analysis  using  the  pre-trained 
baroni  word2vec  model  provided  at  http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebin

automated,  flexible  and  transferable  data-driven  approach  using  NLP 
techniques  that  can  overcome  some  of  the  limitations  of  manual 
methods.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The context primarily discusses natural language processing (NLP) methods used for investigating Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) from social media data. It mentions the use of Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique, and the application of pre-trained models like the baroni word2vec model. Additionally, it refers to the potential benefits of employing emerging transformer-based models, such as BERT, for text classification tasks. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques used within this context.
