significant time and memory resources.

networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

We use different global-feature extractors at different levels for the 
following two reasons. First, a deeper global feature extractor at shallow 
levels  facilitates  reserving  continuous  information.  To  extract  global 
context,  a  straightforward  approach  is  to  enlarge  the  receptive  field, 
which  is  often  achieved  through  dilated  convolution.  If  the  dilated 
convolution is directly conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, 
however,  the  continuous  information  contained  in  them  will  be  lost. 
Thus,  we  apply  more  convolution  and  pooling  operations  at  shallow 
levels before conducting dilated convolution to extract as much original 
continuity information as possible. Second, a series of dilated convolu-
tions at deeper levels facilitates extracting richer global context infor-
mation. At deeper levels, the input feature map’s resolutions are small in 
comparison to those of the shallow layers. Thus, we directly use a group

First,  TA applies  an  l2-norm  normalization  component  to  each 
channel  to  garner  global  spatial  information.  Typical  channel-wise 
attention,  such  as  the  seminal  SE-block  (Hu  et  al.,  2018),  depends 
heavily  on  the  global  average  pooling,  which  often  leads  to  implicit 
channel context aggregation. Different from such an average pooling, 
our  l2  normalization  policy  is  not  only  computationally  efficient  but 
makes channel context more representative. 

Second,  TA assigns  weights  (i.e.,  the  learnable  parameters  α)  to 
different  channels  by  their  significance,  aiming  at  modeling  the  re-
lationships between more significant channels. 

Third,  to  build  the  across-channel  relationship,  TA uses  the 
computation-efficient l2-norm to normalize channels, in order to prevent 
the high computing cost caused by full connection and non-linear op-
erations used by prior works.
