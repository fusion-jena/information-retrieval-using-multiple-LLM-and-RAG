INTRODUCTION

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

Helpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the given sources that the study uses a dataset related to bark beetle outbreaks in coniferous forests. This dataset covers an area of 13,319 hectares and is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). Additionally, more information about the dataset and its statistical analysis can be found in Seidl et al. (2016). Unfortunately, without further details or access to the mentioned references, I cannot provide specific information regarding the collection methods of this raw data.
