%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available for building models, which can improve their performance and generalization capabilities. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but I cannot provide a helpful response to this query as there is no relevant information in the given context regarding the use of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
