where ys is 1 if species s is present (the species has been observed) and 0

s  represents the model’s prediction for species s 
at a random location, S is the number of species considered, and 1[⋅] is the 
indicator function, returning 1 if the condition inside the brackets is true 
and 0 otherwise. It is important to note that this loss function is defined 
for a single presence location, and therefore the overall loss for the entire 
training dataset is computed by averaging over all the presence locations 
in the training set. We observe that L full  is composed of three distinct 
terms, each corresponding to a different type of sample. The first term 
addresses presences, favoring a high score for the species that is present, 
and is weighed by a coefficient λ to compensate for the relatively small

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a specific loss function called L_full. This loss function is designed to handle imbalanced datasets with multiple classes, which is common in ecological studies where there are many more absence points than presence points for any given species. The L_full loss function consists of three terms, each addressing a different type of sample: presences, absences, and background samples. Presence samples receive a higher weight through a coefficient lambda to account for their relative scarcity compared to absence or background samples. By minimizing this loss function during training, the model aims to accurately predict species distributions while accounting for the inherent class imbalance in the data.
