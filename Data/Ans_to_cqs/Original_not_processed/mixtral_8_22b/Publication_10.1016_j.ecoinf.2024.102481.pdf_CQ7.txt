Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied in 
teleost  and  elasmobranch  reproductive  biology,  used  to  determine 
maturation  condition,  sex,  and  spawning  habitats  (Brown-Peterson 
et al., 2021; Brownscombe et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2017; Slembrouck 
et  al.,  2019;  Vitale  et  al.,  2006).  In  this  study,  Random  Forests  (RF) 
analyses  proved  to  be  similarly  effective  in  classifying  maturity  in 
Chilean hake, with high precision measured against the gold-standard of 
histological  staging.  The  RF’s  accuracy  in  classifying  immature  and 
mature-inactive females was notably high, in contrast to macroscopic 
analysis which generally misassigned these stages due to their similar 
external characteristics of the gonads – making them difficult to discern 
by  the  naked  eye,  even  for  experienced  scientific  observers.  This  is  a 
common  problem  in  macroscopic  analysis  beyond  Chilean  hake,

when sampling the fundamentally different population conditions of a 
healthy  versus depleted  stock. The use of  RFs has the  potential to  be 
applied for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attri-
butes  are  essential  for  their  management  and  conservation  in  the 
ecosystem. Machine learning methods may offer an accurate alternative 
to traditional methods to improve our biological understanding in future 
or retrospective research.

incorporation  of  covariates  on  the  reproductive  process  requires 
analytical tools beyond the simple description of gonadal development. 
During  the  last  decade  the  application  of  Machine  Learning  (ML) 
techniques has grown in many research areas, serving to model complex 
relationships in ecology, genetics, and climate change (Lindegren et al., 
2020;  Rolnick  et  al.,  2022;  Schrider  and  Kern,  2018;  Smoli´nski  and 
Radtke, 2017). Machine learning algorithms use computational methods 
to  “learn”  directly  from  data  without  relying  on  a  carefully  defined 
function  as  a  model  -  in  contrast  to  a  linear  model  say,  where  the 
function must be made explicit. They are generally predictive models 
and characterised by having few assumptions and little dependency on 
the  classic  statistical  assumptions  of  conventional  models  (e.g.  error

Helpful Answer:
In machine learning, including deep learning, datasets are typically divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Each subset serves a specific purpose during the model building and evaluation process.

1. Training Set: This is the largest portion of the dataset, usually around 60-80%. It is used to train the model, meaning it helps the model learn patterns and relationships within the data. During training, the model adjusts its parameters based on the errors it makes while trying to predict the target variable.

2. Validation Set: Also known as the development or holdout set, this subset comprises about 10-20% of the total dataset. Its primary function is to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data because it has learned the noise and outliers instead of generalizing the underlying pattern. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set after each epoch (complete pass through the training data), we can identify the optimal number of iterations before the model starts to overfit.

3. Testing Set: This subset represents approximately 10-20% of the entire dataset. Once the final model has been trained using the training set and validated using the validation set, it is evaluated on the testing set. This step provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on completely new, unseen data. Since the testing set remains entirely separate throughout the training and validation processes, it offers a reliable measure of the model's ability to generalize.

These proportions are not fixed and can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset. However, maintaining a balance between the three sets ensures that the model is robust, accurate, and capable of handling real-world scenarios effectively.
