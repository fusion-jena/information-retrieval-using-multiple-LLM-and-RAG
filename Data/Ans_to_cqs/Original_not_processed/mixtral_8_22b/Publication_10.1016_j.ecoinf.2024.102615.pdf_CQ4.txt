The performance of a neural network is traditionally improved by 
optimizing  its  hyperparameters,  which  influence  the  overall  model 
performance.  Using  different  hyperparameter  combinations  (e.g., 
combining  different  learning  rates  and  dropout  values)  will  lead  to 
marked  differences  in  the  predictive  performance  of  a  model.  As  a 
traditional  hyperparameter  optimization  method,  the  grid  search 
approach is widely used to optimize a model by comparing the values of 
evaluation  metrics  for  different  parameters  and  selecting  the  optimal 
parameters from a large search space (Bhagat et al., 2020). This method 
can optimize the model by comparing the values of evaluation metrics 
for different parameters and selecting the optimal parameters from the 
search space. In this study, the grid search method was used to optimize 
five of the MLP model’s hyperparameters. The hyperparameter adjust-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about data augmentation techniques applied in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shifting, shearing, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of the model.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing images, while rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling changes the size of the image, either increasing or decreasing it. Cropping removes parts of the image, while zooming magnifies portions of the image. Shifting moves the image along one axis, and shearing distorts the image along one axis. Adding noise introduces random variations into the image. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data being analyzed and the goals of the analysis.
