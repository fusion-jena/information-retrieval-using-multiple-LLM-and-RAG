RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6. 
and then compared it with the state-of-the-art 
approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy.

Data preprocessing 

Before  the  training  stage,  we  first  need  to 
pre-process  the  raw  data  from  the  dataset.  
The input of the pose estimator is the cropped 
image,  but  the  original  ground  truth  of  the 
image  is  the  absolute  position  in  the  entire 
raw image. Therefore, there is a need to first 
transform  the  ground  truth  into  a  relative 
position  with  respect  to  the  center  of  the 
hand. Finally, the images are sized to 96x96 
and  in  grey-scale  with  values  normalized 
between 0 and 1.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that one possible criterion could be reaching a certain level of accuracy during the training process. In this case, the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 95.06%, which was higher than the previously reported accuracy of 91%. Additionally, the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and reached this accuracy after 140 epochs. These details suggest that the training may have been considered complete once the desired level of accuracy was achieved or after a certain number of epochs had been completed. Other common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in the validation loss or a decrease in the learning rate. However, without more information, it cannot be definitively stated what specific criteria were used in this particular study.
