the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

means the images where the extracted numerical features were used in 
Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in

ing illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. Considering only studies 
focusing on molluscs, several deep learning approaches to image-based 
data have been employed for several purposes, although to our knowl-
edge none within the food traceability framework (Table 2). Regarding 
some  of  the  published  examples  of  applications  of  deep  learning  ap-
proaches to mollusc image analysis for different purposes, it is possible 
to observe that the use of CNNs is rather common, including some of the 
tested  algorithms  in  the  present  paper.  In  terms  of  accuracy,  and 
although  the  remaining  analyzed  studies  do  not  focus  on  the  same 
purposes as our study, it is possible to observe that all of them present 
high classification accuracies using deep learning approaches, being our 
study  among  the  highest  ranked  in  terms  of  model  classification 
efficiency.

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase 
factor in accuracy as compared to its equivalent model to Approach 1 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the raw data collected for the deep learning models mentioned are primarily images related to molluscs. These images could be obtained through various means such as underwater cameras, drones, or even publicly available datasets. It is also stated that the images were used for detecting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, suggesting that they might have been captured in marine environments. Nevertheless, without more precise information regarding the data collection process, it would be speculative to definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering the raw data.
