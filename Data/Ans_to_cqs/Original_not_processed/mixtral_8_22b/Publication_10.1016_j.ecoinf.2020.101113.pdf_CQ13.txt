2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

learning, wherein a model already optimized for a similar dataset is re- 
trained with new data. We used a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the 
ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across

1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). Although ImageNet does not contain 
spectrograms,  models  pre-trained  with  the  dataset  learn  a  variety  of 
image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram clas-
sification  previously  (Lasseck,  2019;  Florentin  et  al.,  2020).  While 
previous  studies  have  found  optimal  performance  using  ensembles  of 
multiple CNN models (Kahl et al., 2017; Lasseck, 2019; Florentin et al., 
2020), in the interest of prediction efficiency and reasonable memory 
requirements, we chose to evaluate a single ResNet50 model.

be  necessary  to  increase  the  training  data  size  for  rare  species.  Thus, 
future  efforts  should  investigate  optimal  data  augmentation  methods 
for  bioacoustic  recognition.  Third,  an  important  challenge  will  be  to 
maintain  high  accuracy  while  increasing  the  efficiency  of  prediction. 
This  will  require  increasing  the  prediction  speed  and  decreasing  the 
memory  footprint  of  the  model by  investigating  other  network archi-
tectures and reducing the number of parameters.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that a ResNet50 model was utilized, which had been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This implies that transfer learning was applied, where a model trained on one task is adapted to another related task. In this case, the pre-trained model was fine-tuned for spectrogram classification. Additionally, the text suggests that the researchers focused on maintaining high accuracy while improving prediction efficiency and reducing memory requirements, which could involve adjusting various hyperparameters. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding these aspects, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.
