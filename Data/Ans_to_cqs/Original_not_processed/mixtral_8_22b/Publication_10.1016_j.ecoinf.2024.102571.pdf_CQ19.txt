Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks or libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to develop the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture was developed using activation functions like tansig and purelin. This suggests that the model might have been built using general programming languages like Python or MATLAB, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed if any popular deep learning frameworks were utilized.
