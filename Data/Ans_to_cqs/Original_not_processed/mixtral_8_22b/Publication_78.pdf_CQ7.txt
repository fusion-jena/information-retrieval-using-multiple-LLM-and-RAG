where (cid:107) ξi − ξ j (cid:107) provides the Euclidean distance between two samples. Width of Gaussian
kernel can be set by variance (cid:36) that controls the classiﬁer performance.

3.5. Confusion Matrix

It is the parameter to validate the performance of a machine learning model. It also
tells us the accomplishment of the classiﬁcation problem. Following are some of the
essential parameters of the confusion matrix.

True Positive (TP): It is the accurate prediction of the bleached corals.
True Negative (TN): It is the accurate prediction of the unbleached corals.
False Positive (FP): It is the false prediction of the bleached corals.
False Negative (FN): It is the false prediction of the unbleached corals.
Sensitivity (TPR): It is the ratio of accurate prediction of the corals and can be given
by Equation (4).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include the following:

1. Train Set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns from this data and adjusts its internal parameters accordingly. Typically, around 60-80% of the total data is allocated for training purposes.

2. Test Set: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated using new, unseen data to assess how well it has learned. This evaluation is done using the test set, which should ideally contain data not seen during training. Usually, about 20-30% of the total data is reserved for testing.

3. Validation Set: In addition to the train and test sets, sometimes a third subset called the validation set is created. This set is used during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation set is usually derived from the training set itself, with a common practice being to use 10-20% of the training data for validation.

These splits help ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and does not simply memorize the training examples.
