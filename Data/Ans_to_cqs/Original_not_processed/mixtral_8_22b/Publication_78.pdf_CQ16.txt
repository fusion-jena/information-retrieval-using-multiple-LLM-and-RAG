where (cid:107) ξi − ξ j (cid:107) provides the Euclidean distance between two samples. Width of Gaussian
kernel can be set by variance (cid:36) that controls the classiﬁer performance.

3.5. Confusion Matrix

It is the parameter to validate the performance of a machine learning model. It also
tells us the accomplishment of the classiﬁcation problem. Following are some of the
essential parameters of the confusion matrix.

True Positive (TP): It is the accurate prediction of the bleached corals.
True Negative (TN): It is the accurate prediction of the unbleached corals.
False Positive (FP): It is the false prediction of the bleached corals.
False Negative (FN): It is the false prediction of the unbleached corals.
Sensitivity (TPR): It is the ratio of accurate prediction of the corals and can be given
by Equation (4).

Sensitivity

(TPR) =

TP
(TP + FN)

Speciﬁcity (Sy): It is the ratio of the prediction of unbleached corals and can be given
by Equation (5).

Accuracy: The ratio of correct prediction to the total number of instances can be given
by Equation (6).

Accuracy =

Cohen’s Kappa (κ): κ gives us the amount of data by the execution of classiﬁer for the
examination of the its performance in case of some coincidence. It can be calculated
by Equation (8) [34].

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include reaching a minimum threshold for accuracy or other performance metrics, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or setting a maximum number of iterations or time limit for training. In this study, it appears that various models were trained using different methods, such as SVM with RBF kernel, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, but no specific stopping criterion was mentioned. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete in this particular study.
