cropland to forests and grasslands has been adequately promoted in our 
framework. The monitoring system has improved, and the restoration of 
degraded grasslands and the integration and optimization of different 
types  of  nature  reserves  have  been  incorporated.  Finally,  further 
research and improvement are needed in the mathematical modeling of 
the objective function of the MOP model, the selection of uncertainty 
methods, and the experimentation of prediction methods. Attempts can 
be  made  to  remodel  the  MOP  model  using  models  such  as  interval 
planning  and  chance-constrained  planning,  and  machine  learning 
methods can be used to process the time series data.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

Helpful Answer:
After completing the model training phase, several postprocessing steps may be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which input features contribute most significantly to a model's output by highlighting areas of importance within the input data. This technique can provide valuable insights into how the model makes its predictions and identify any potential biases or weaknesses in the input data.

Calculating various performance metrics allows researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of their trained model objectively. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These metrics enable comparisons between different models and configurations, helping researchers select the best approach for their particular application.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating classification models. It provides a tabular representation of actual versus predicted classifications, allowing researchers to quickly assess the model's strengths and weaknesses across different classes. By examining the confusion matrix, one can determine where the model performs well and where it struggles, guiding future improvements and optimizations.
