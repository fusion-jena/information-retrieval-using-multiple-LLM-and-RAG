Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
There is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the given context. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, some common techniques can be mentioned. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that each class has equal representation in both training and testing datasets; oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority classes are reduced to match the size of minority classes; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources or conditions to ensure broad representation. It should be noted that these methods may not all apply directly to image processing tasks, but they provide a starting point for addressing potential biases in deep learning pipelines.
