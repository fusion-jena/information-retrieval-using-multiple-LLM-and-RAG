In Experiment 9, we achieve a reduction in the number of parame-
ters, GFLOPs, and model size while incurring a marginal loss of 0.8% in 
P and 0.1% in R, and a minor decrease in mAP. In contrast, Experiment 
10 yields a significant reduction in the number of parameters and model 
size, with only 36.32% of the original model parameters and 38.71% of 
its  model  size.  Although  a  reduction  in  the  mAP  is  observed,  the 
improved  model  demonstrates  the  shortest  processing  time.  Further-
more, R reaches its peak, and P remains on par with the original model, 
achieving an optimal balance point. These findings show that the com-
bination  of  the  Multicat  module,  Reduce  detection  head,  and  C2flite 
module has the best overall performance (Fig. 11). The Multicat module 
significantly offsets the large increase in GFLOPs and processing time 
due to reduced detection heads, while the combination with the C2flite

To select the optimal model, we employed various metrics to assess 
its performance, including parameters, GFLOPS, time, P, R, mAP, and 
model size. P stands for precision and R stands for recall. The mAP50

4. Discussion 

Real-time  detection  and  counting  of  pests  in  a  specific  area  are 
important  for  timely  pest  spotting  and  control.  This  work  helps  to 
quickly determine the distribution and quantity of pests in the current 
environment, not only by providing critical data for agricultural man-
agement but also by helping to optimize the use of pesticides, thereby 
preventing  unnecessary  pesticide  waste  and  environmental  pollution 
(Dhankhar and Kumar, 2023; Liu et al., 2021).
