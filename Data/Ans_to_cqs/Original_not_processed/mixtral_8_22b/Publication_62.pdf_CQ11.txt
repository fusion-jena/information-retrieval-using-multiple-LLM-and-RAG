Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Deep   learning   might   ultimately   be   leveraged   in   many   ways   for   many   diﬀerent   types   of
NHCs.   Here,   we   focus   on   the   digitized   portion   (currently   1.2   million   specimens)   of   the
United States National Herbarium. Our analyses, focused on the detection of specimens
previously treated with mercury and the discrimination of superﬁcially similar plant families,
are complementary to those recently published on species identiﬁcation (Carranza-Rojas et
al. 2017) and further demonstrate how CNNs might be used to learn more from NHCs.

Materials and methods

typically accessible only to researchers who can physically visit repositories. Digitization
eﬀorts obviate the need for many types of in-person data gathering (Beaman and Cellinese
2012)   and   remarkable   progress   is   now   being   made   in   compiling   specimen   data   and
images   (Barkworth   and   Murrell   2012).   Coupling   these   data   with   the   classiﬁcation
capabilities of CNNs will unlock more of the rich potential of NHCs.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include a direct link to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the study focuses on the digitized portion of the United States National Herbarium, which currently consists of 1.2 million specimens. Additionally, there are supplementary materials listed, including notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These notebooks can be downloaded as Mathematica notebook files or PDF files. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a direct link to a data repository containing the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study.
