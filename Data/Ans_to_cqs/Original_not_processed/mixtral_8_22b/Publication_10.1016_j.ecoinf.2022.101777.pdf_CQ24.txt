Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF), which is a machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle randomness effectively.

Random Forest works by creating multiple decision trees from different subsets of the data, each with varying degrees of randomness introduced during their creation. This randomness can be controlled through various hyperparameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. By averaging the predictions of these diverse trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves overall performance.

While the text does not explicitly discuss managing randomness through a fixed random seed value, this practice is common in many machine learning applications. Setting a fixed random seed allows for reproducibility of results across experiments and ensures consistency when comparing models trained under identical conditions. In the case of Random Forest, fixing the random seed would ensure that the same subset of features and samples are selected for each tree, leading to consistent results between runs.
