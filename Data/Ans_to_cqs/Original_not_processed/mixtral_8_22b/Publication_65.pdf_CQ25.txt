Figure 9. Schematic diagram of the evaluation process.

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

2.2.2. Evaluation Metrics

The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

Therefore, our originality comes from the dataset and the exertion of deep learning
algorithms to improve the nature conservation efforts in this region, and our primary con-
tribution is related to the investigation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods
to detect trees in urban areas. For this task, we used data with a high spatial resolution
(Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 10 cm) inside an urban area inside the Cerrado biome
and used ﬁve state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to process the data. Deep learning-
based approaches designed to tackle this task receive, as input, an image and return as
output, another image, generally with the exact size of the input data with each pixel
associated with one class. We choose to use deep learning because they present a better
performance in semantic segmentation and scene interpretation tasks over traditional
machine learning and trained professionals in many ﬁelds of science as demonstrated
by [38–42].

U-Net and SegNet: According to [43], the U-Net architecture was the ﬁrst network to
propose an encoder-decoder architecture to perform semantic segmentation tasks. This
deep network was created by [45] to segment biomedical images. To generate an initial
prediction map, are used the encoder and max-pooling layers with feature extraction. The
encoder consists of a stack of convolution, and the decoder comprises convolutions, decon-
volutions, and unpooling layers in a symmetrical expanding path, using deconvolution
ﬁlters to up-sample the feature maps. An illustration of this architecture is presented

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models employed in this study is to perform semantic segmentation tasks within an urban area located in the Cerrado biome. These models take an image as input and output another image of the same size, where each pixel is associated with a specific class. The goal is to identify and label different objects or regions within the input image accurately. In particular, these models aim to detect trees in urban areas, which can contribute to nature conservation efforts in the region. The five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures used include FCN, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet. Each of these architectures has been developed to address various computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image segmentation, and scene understanding. However, their application in this research focuses specifically on semantic segmentation for tree detection in urban environments.
