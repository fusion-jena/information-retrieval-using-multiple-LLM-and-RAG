bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Appendix C. Site: S2 

C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on inter- and intra-brand recordings using different devices (SongMeter and AudioMoth), sample schemes, frequencies, and gain settings. The goal appears to be minimizing device bias for broader comparative analyses and potential applications in machine learning and deep learning. However, no explicit mention of any particular dataset was made.
