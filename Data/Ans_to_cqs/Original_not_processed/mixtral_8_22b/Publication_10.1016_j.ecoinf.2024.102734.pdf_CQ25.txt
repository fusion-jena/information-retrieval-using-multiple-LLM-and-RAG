query set are negative. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) propose transductive
propagation that iteratively propagates labels from labelled instances to
unlabelled instances according to the graph structure of the embeddings.
Other semi-supervised learning techniques have been applied such as
active learning. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2022) combines a few-shot

Machine learning tasks designed for low-data contexts are referred to
as few-shot learning tasks. Within the context of bioacoustic applications,

the field of computational bioacoustics (Stowell, 2021) has experienced
significant development over the last few years, in part due to public
challenges such as the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes
and Events (DCASE) (Nolasco et al., 2023).

We compare three classification models - ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016),
Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) and HuBERT
(Hsu et al., 2021). The classification models compared in Section 4.1
were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments automatically
generated by the annotator. The dataset includes 1130 possum vocal-
isations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset has an 80/20% training-
validation split which is used to evaluate model performance during
training. Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the
recommendation outlined by the model authors. Each segment has been
manually reviewed by a human. 500 segments are separated into a test
set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The
distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of
the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset
performance are reported. Using the test dataset we evaluate the model

Feature extraction model selection is evaluated in Section 4.1.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is being used for classification purposes. This is because the text mentions comparing three classification models - ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT. These models are known for their use in image and audio classification tasks. Furthermore, the context discusses evaluating the model using a test dataset containing both positive and negative examples, which is a common practice in classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes within the context of computational bioacoustics.
