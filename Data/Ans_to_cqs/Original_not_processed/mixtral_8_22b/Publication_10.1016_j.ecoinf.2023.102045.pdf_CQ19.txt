Obviously,  open  source  code  is  always  in  motion.  As  an  example, 
concerning point (i), an image might also be gathered via screenshot and 
sent  to  R,  e.g.  based  on  standalone  software  like  flameshot  (htt 
ps://flameshot.org/).  Moreover,  additional  and  more  sophisticated 
methods to let a function distinguish between minima and maxima in a 
rainbow colour palette like Random Forest or neural networks can be 
implemented in the cblindplot package. 

Inspiring  R  packages  have  been  devoted  to  improve  mapping  of 
various scientifically sound response variables like biodiversity (F´eret 
and de Boissieu, 2020) or species distributions (Schuetz et al., 2020a; 
Schuetz et al., 2020b). Connecting the cblindplot package with such 
libraries  would  be  an  enormous  advantage  for  colour  blind  people. 
Hence, the authors of the present paper have contacted the developers of 
such packages to implement such function in their packages.
