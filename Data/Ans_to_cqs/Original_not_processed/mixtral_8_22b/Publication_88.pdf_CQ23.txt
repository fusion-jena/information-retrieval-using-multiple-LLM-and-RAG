The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

2.6. Inﬂuence of the Number of Training Samples

To evaluate the inﬂuence of the number of training samples, four scenarios were considered.
Speciﬁcally collecting samples from the training set of a one, two, three and four tiles, denoted as Ni,
where i corresponds to the number of tiles used in each scenario. For EF and SN methods, the validation
set (val) was used to stop training once the loss increased in 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping).
As mentioned before, for CSVM and SVM the samples in this set were added to the training set (tr).
The number of training samples in each scenario for the Amazon and Cerrado databases is presented
in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were taken during its development and evaluation process. Firstly, the authors utilized diverse datasets consisting of satellite images from both the Amazon and Cerrado regions. These datasets contained various types of land cover, such as deforestation and non-deforestation areas, which helped improve the robustness of the model.

Secondly, the data was split into different subsets – training, validation, and testing – using stratified sampling based on the available deforested and non-deforested samples. This approach ensured that the class distribution remained consistent across all subsets, preventing any potential bias towards specific classes.

Thirdly, the authors employed a technique called early stopping while training the model. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on the validation set and halting the training process when there is no further improvement observed over multiple epochs. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Lastly, the authors also experimented with varying numbers of training samples to assess the influence of sample size on the model's performance. By doing so, they could determine the optimal amount of training data required to achieve good generalization without compromising computational efficiency or risking overfitting.

In summary, the authors took several steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, including utilizing diverse datasets, employing stratified sampling for data splitting, implementing early stopping during training, and evaluating the impact of varying training sample sizes.
