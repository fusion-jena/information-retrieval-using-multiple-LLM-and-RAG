Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Despite its invasive nature, iceplant remains a minority land cover 
class  in  most  NAIP  scenes  in  this  region  compared  to  non-iceplant 
vegetation. Generating training and test data by sampling designs such 
as  random  sampling  or  allocating  samples  in  proportion  to  expected 
class  areas  would  therefore  result  in  a  highly  unbalanced  dataset. 
Training machine learning models with unbalanced sets poses a chal-
lenge to accurately predicting the minority class, often leading to under- 
predicting  it,  and  multiple  methods  exist in  the  literature  to  improve 
balance  in  a  dataset  (He  and  Garcia,  2009).  Due  to  the  high  spatial 
resolution of NAIP and the expanse of the study region, data availability 
for both classes allowed us to create a reasonably balanced final training 
dataset  having  38%  iceplant  points  and  62%  other  vegetation  points 
without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points.

4.3. Model development 

We developed a random forest (RF) binary classification model to 
identify  iceplant  within  Santa  Barbara  County  coast  vegetation.  The 
model was then used to perform a per-pixel analysis of all NAIP scenes 
from 2020 over this region (Section 4.4). A RF classifier is a supervised 
classifier that uses a set of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to 
make a prediction (Breiman, 2001). Each tree in the RF is created using a 
subset of the training data randomly sampled with replacement. A user- 
defined number of features is randomly selected from the data’s features 
to grow the tree at each splitting node. After all trees in the RF have been 
trained, the classification of a new data sample comes from averaging 
the class assignment probabilities for the sample produced by all trees in 
the forest.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, common strategies include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by randomness.

Based on the provided context, I can infer that the authors did not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in their deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, some general strategies for managing randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixing the random seed value: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can ensure reproducibility in experiments involving random processes, such as weight initialization, batch selection, and dropout regularization. This allows researchers to compare different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization methods more reliably.

2. Using deterministic algorithms: Wherever possible, opting for deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones can help eliminate sources of randomness. For instance, using a deterministic optimizer like gradient descent instead of a stochastic variant like Adam can lead to more consistent results.

3. Cross-validation and ensemble methods: To mitigate the impact of randomness on performance estimates, researchers can employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation and ensemble methods. These approaches involve partitioning the dataset into subsets, training multiple models, and aggregating their predictions. This helps reduce variance due to random factors and provides a more robust estimate of model performance.
