amount  of  data,  distribution  data  for  machine  learning  models  and 
physiological data for process-based models. For both types of models, 
the  data  is  difficult  and  costly  to  collect.  This  poses  a  bottleneck  for 
building SDMs for practical use.

Following this, forward feature selection (FFS) was performed. FFS is 
a  common  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Hastie  et  al.,  2020),  which 
begins with an empty model, and iteratively selects the next feature from 
the initial set which most improves model performance. Candidate lo-
gistic  regression  and  random  forest  models  were  evaluated  via  (1) 
random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV (Roberts et al., 2017), 
in which the full training dataset was partitioned into spatial blocks like 
those shown in Fig. 2. 

Because model performance estimated via spatial CV is dependent on 
the spatial configuration of the CV folds, the procedure was repeated 
over 100 random blocking configurations; those features selected most

fold was also utilized when calculating numerical scores for the models.

The  iterative  model  exploration  in  this  work  roughly  follows  the 
Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). The 
Bayesian and non-Bayesian model pairs are chosen so that one repre-
sents  a  less  flexible  model  in  terms  of  possible  shapes  of  its  decision 
boundary (Bayesian logistic regression and MLE logistic regression) and 
one  represents  a  more  flexible  model  (Bayesian  GAM  and  random 
forest).
