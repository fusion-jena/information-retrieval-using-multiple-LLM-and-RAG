2.2. Training data and validation distribution data 

The workflow adopted for data acquisition, preparation and to set RF 
models are summarized in Fig. 2. The field data were collected during 
the summer season in 2010 (see Boscutti et al., 2015 for details about the 
field sampling procedure). The presence or absence and the cover per-
centage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling 
point, by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. To reduce the 
effects  introduced  by  non-vegetated  and  mixed  pixels,  the  points  not 
falling within the region of interest (ROI) (i.e. main channels and tidal 
islands  of  the  lagoon), and  the  points  considered  mixed  (i.e.  those in 
which  the  co-occurrence  of  multiple  species  was  recorded),  were 
removed. The removed mixed points represented 16.7% of the original 
data.  Considering  the different  combinations of  the three  species’  co-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on using random forest classification for statistical analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, some general techniques can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that the class proportions in the training dataset remain similar to those in the overall dataset; oversampling, where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves collecting more varied data to improve model performance. It should be noted that these techniques may not necessarily apply to this particular study without further information.
