The  selected  network  models  were  initialized  with  pre-
trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to our datasets. 
The performance of a deep neural network for a dataset highly 
depends on network hyperparameters. The selection and fine-
tuning of  optimized hyperparameters  is  generally  a  difficult 
and  time-consuming  task.  Instead  of  manually  selecting  the 
hyperparameters, we employed Bayesian optimization to find 
their optimal values for each of the six models.  A Gaussian 
process  model  of  the  objective  function  is  used  by  the 
Bayesian optimization technique.  Different variables can be 
optimized using this technique such as network section depth, 
batch size, initial learning rate, momentum, and regularization 
strength. For this study, we optimized the network for batch 
size  (between  1  and  32)  and  initial  learning  rate  (between 
1×10-4  and  1×10-2).  The  optimization  was  performed  by

minimizing  the  loss  on  the  validation  dataset  to  perform 
objective function evaluations. The models were trained for a 
maximum of 10 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent 
with  a  momentum  (‘sgdm’)  optimizer.  Thus,  a  total  of  six

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that one of the hyperparameters optimized during training was'regularization strength'. This suggests that some form of regularization was indeed applied. Regularization techniques help to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages complex models. Common types of regularization include L1 and L2 regularization, also known as Lasso and Ridge regression respectively, and Dropout. L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as penalty term, while L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of coefficients. Dropout is another popular regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or 'dropped out' during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. Without further information, it cannot be determined exactly which type of regularization was used in this case.
