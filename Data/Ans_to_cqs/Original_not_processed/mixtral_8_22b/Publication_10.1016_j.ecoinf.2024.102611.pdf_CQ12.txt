samples in GSL100 would also help in the extensibility of the developing 
a deep learning model that works on multiple levels.

2.2. Classification using deep learning models 

Plant  leaf  recognition  has  been  carried  out  using  deep  learning 
models for adaptability to handle many species or classes. Some of the 
investigations in these directions are as discussed.

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several research papers that use various types of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and classification tasks. These include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 architectures, as well as other unnamed deep learning models. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
