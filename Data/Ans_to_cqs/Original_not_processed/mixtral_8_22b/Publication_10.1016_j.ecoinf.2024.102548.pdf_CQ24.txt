3. Deep learning techniques 

In the Deep Learning section, we delve into the technical aspects of 
our  model.  We  utilize  RNNs  to  effectively  capture  sequential  de-
pendencies in the data. RNNs, such as LSTM and GRUs, allow our model 
to retain and propagate information from previous steps, enhancing its 
understanding of sequential patterns. Additionally, we employ transfer 
learning  techniques,  initializing  our  model  with  pre-trained  weights 
from  large-scale  datasets  like  ImageNet.  This  transfer  of  knowledge 
enhances  the  modelâ€™s  performance  by  leveraging  learned  representa-
tions  from  related  tasks.  Detailed  explanations  and  implementation 
specifics of RNNs and transfer learning are provided in the subsequent 
subsections.

The implications of our findings for the agricultural sector are sub-
stantial.  Timely  and  accurate  detection  of  YVMV  using  deep  learning 
techniques empowers farmers with the ability to implement proactive 
interventions, preventing the spread of the virus and minimizing eco-
nomic  losses.  Our  study  lays  the  foundation  for  the  development  of 
automated systems capable of scanning large-scale crop fields, swiftly 
identifying  infected  plants,  and  supporting  decision-making  processes 
for farmers.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or explanation regarding how the authors handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seeds, in the given context. Therefore, it would be speculative to provide any specific strategies they might have employed without further information. However, some common practices to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed random seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average predictions across multiple runs, and applying cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on various dataset splits.
