In contrast, the Distortion method solely considers the distance of the 
data within the cluster. It is suitable for use on data with high separation 
and no longer involves the distance between clusters. Datasets with high 
overlap do not necessitate separation; they only require cohesion. We 
observe that the Distortion starts with a high value and then continues to 
decrease.  These  results  suggest  that  an  increased  cluster  number  will 
reduce the intra-cluster distance, indicating an improvement in cluster 
quality. However, our goal is not to determine good cluster quality but to 
identify the correct elbows in the transitions between clusters. There-
fore, these results are followed by analysis using the Elbow method.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization can be applied during training to reduce model complexity and improve generalization performance. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. Other techniques like early stopping or weight decay can also help prevent overfitting. However, without further information from the original source, it cannot be determined if these methods were specifically utilized in this study.
