Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not explicitly mention the specific data format used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, based on the context, we can infer that some of them use image data. For instance, [18], [19], [20], and [21] all discuss applications related to image analysis or recognition. Specifically, [18] uses a deep learning CNN architecture for analyzing water pollution in agriculture, while [19] introduces a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition. Similarly, [20] describes an automatic localization and count method for agricultural crop pests, and [21] presents a benchmarking study for pest detection and identification using internal databases. Additionally, [25] mentions the use of X-ray scans for diagnosing COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases, which suggests the use of medical imaging data. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these studies employ image data in their deep learning pipelines. However, without explicit information about the data format used in each case, we cannot definitively state what other types of data may have been utilized.
