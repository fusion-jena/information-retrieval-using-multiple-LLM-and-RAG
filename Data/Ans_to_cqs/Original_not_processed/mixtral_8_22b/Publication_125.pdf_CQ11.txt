4.2.1. Data Augmentation

The fundamental concept behind the ResNet model is to use shortcut links to bypass
blocks of convolutional layers (bottleneck). The CONV layers each have a 3 × 3 ﬁlter
and are designed according to two rules: (1) the layers have the same number of ﬁlters
with the same output feature map size and (2) the number of ﬁlters is multiplied if the
feature map size is halved. The convolutional layers conduct the downsampling with
a stride of 2. The network ends with an average POOL layer and 1000 FC layers with
a SoftMax activation function. The default input size is 224 × 224 × 3 [24].
Xception: The Xception model’s architecture was proposed by Chollet (2017). This
model is a CNN-based architecture also trained on the ImageNet dataset. The Xception
architecture comprises 36 CONV layers with a 3 × 3 ﬁlter and stride of 2. These CONV
layers are structured into 14 modules, all of which have the ReLu activation function

The motivation driving this speciﬁc research project is to link two cutting-edge re-
search topics, which are DL and privacy. Indeed, the progress of machine learning (ML)
and its subﬁeld of deep learning (DL) need not come at the expense of privacy or data
security. Therefore, this research work proposes a powerful approach based on PPDL
utilized on big satellite images in order to maintain anonymity and safeguard privacy
related to data. Our main contribution is to apply PPDL for satellite images’ data, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is an approach that has not been proposed or attempted
anywhere in the literature. In particular, the contributions of this study are:

Abstract: Satellite images have drawn increasing interest from a wide variety of users, including
business and government, ever since their increased usage in important ﬁelds ranging from weather,
forestry and agriculture to surface changes and biodiversity monitoring. Recent updates in the ﬁeld
have also introduced various deep learning (DL) architectures to satellite imagery as a means of
extracting useful information. However, this new approach comes with its own issues, including
the fact that many users utilize ready-made cloud services (both public and private) in order to
take advantage of built-in DL algorithms and thus avoid the complexity of developing their own
DL architectures. However, this presents new challenges to protecting data against unauthorized
access, mining and usage of sensitive information extracted from that data. Therefore, new privacy
concerns regarding sensitive data in satellite images have arisen. This research proposes an efﬁcient

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources such as the original paper, author contact details, or other related resources to find out more about the specific data repository used in this case.
