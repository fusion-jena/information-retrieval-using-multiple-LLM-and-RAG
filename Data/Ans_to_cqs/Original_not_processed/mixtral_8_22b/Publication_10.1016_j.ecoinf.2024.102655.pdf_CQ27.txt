study and larger datasets do not necessarily produce more precise
models as the use of too much data can lead to model overtraining and
precision loss (Sj¨oberg and Ljung, 1995). Additionally, water quality
datasets are composed of a large number of parameters that often
represent redundant information (Haghiabi et al., 2018; Muharemi
et al., 2019). Despite these known issues, detailed analysis of historical
variation in a dataset is rarely employed for selecting training data
subsets prior to developing predictive models. It is anticipated that their
implementation may improve the training step and, therefore, lead to
improved predictive outputs. For these reasons, analyzing historical
trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and
representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training.

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses machine learning models and discusses the importance of selecting appropriate training data subsets for improving predictive outputs. Based on this information, we can infer that the deployment process likely involves saving or serializing the trained model and then integrating it into a suitable platform for making predictions. This could involve using popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model serialization and platforms like Flask or Django for web application integration. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the deployment process, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
