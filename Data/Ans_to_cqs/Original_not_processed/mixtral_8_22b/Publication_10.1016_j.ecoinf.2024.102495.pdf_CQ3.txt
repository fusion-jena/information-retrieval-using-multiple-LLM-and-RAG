2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (Fran√ßa et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

In the CNN, feature extraction is automatically performed through a 
convolution process that applies a convolution kernel to the input data 
and pooling, which progressively reduces the spatial size of data rep-
resentation (Fernandes et al., 2021). Using convolution layers, pooling, 
and the parameter-sharing feature also makes CNN effective and effi-
cient  in  classifying  data,  such  as  images  and  sound  recordings  (Kim 
et al., 2018). When processing voice-recorded data, a visual represen-
tation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram is generated (Thakur 
and Kumar, 2021). Therefore, as with image data, a CNN can be used to 
map  patterns  from  a  given  sound  recording  data  (a  mosquito  voice 
recording in this case). Additionally, it can produce considerably higher 
accuracy than other deep learning algorithms.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does discuss the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for analyzing voice-recorded data. In this case, the feature extraction process involves generating a visual representation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram. The CNN then uses this visual representation to map patterns from the sound recording data. It should be noted that data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are typically associated with image data rather than audio data.
