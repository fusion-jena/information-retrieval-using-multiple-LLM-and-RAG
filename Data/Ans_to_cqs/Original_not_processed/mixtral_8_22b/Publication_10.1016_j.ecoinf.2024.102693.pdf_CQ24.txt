Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information.

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can ensure reproducibility in their experiments. This means that every time the code runs, it will produce the same results, making it easier to compare and debug.

2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some machine learning libraries offer deterministic versions of certain algorithms, ensuring consistent output even when using different seeds.

3. Data shuffling: When training a model, randomly shuffling the input data before each epoch helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model learns from diverse examples.

4. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, early stopping, and weight decay help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize across various datasets.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or hyperparameters can lead to better overall performance and robustness against randomness.
