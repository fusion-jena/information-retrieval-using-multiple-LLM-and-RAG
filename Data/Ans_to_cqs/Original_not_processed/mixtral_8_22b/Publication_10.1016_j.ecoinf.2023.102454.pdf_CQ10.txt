where  i  is  the  type  of  energy  source;  Gi  is  the  annual  consumption 
amount of energy i, Ei  is the standard coal conversion factor of energy 
source type i, and each type of energy consumption can be converted to 
standard coal consumption based on its calorific value; Ki is the emission 
coefficient of CO2 for each type of energy source; and 44/12 is the molar 
ratio of CO2  to C. The energy consumption statistics of this study are 
broadly classified into nine categories, encompassing raw coal, crude, 
coke, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity.

2.1.1. Study area 

Since  the  reform  and  opening  up,  Xi'an,  as  the  core  city  of  the 
Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration and a national central city, has 
been  experiencing rapid economic  development while  simultaneously 
driving  the  economic  development  of  Northwest  China  (Zhang  et  al., 
2022). Currently, Xi'an is repositioned as the core city of the “Belt and 
Road”, supporting the east and starting the west, connecting north and 
south. Xi'an is situated in the middle of the Guanzhong Plain, spanning 
45′N, as 
between longitude 107
illustrated in Fig. 2. As of 2021, the total area of Xi'an is 10,108 km2, 
encompassing  11  districts  and  two  counties.  The  city  has  a  resident 
population  of  12.952  million,  a  gross  domestic  product  of  1002.03 
billion yuan, and a population urbanization rate of 79.49%.
