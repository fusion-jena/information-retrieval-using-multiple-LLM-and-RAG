In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

D0,  min  defines the time taken for the ecological target to reach a con-
dition score of 1- ε from a condition score of 0. FERM then assumes that 
the time taken to reach a condition score of 1- ε is linear within respect to 
the condition score at the start of the wet spell. Epsilon is used to solve 
the asymptotic nature of the curve, which allows for physically-based 
parameterization.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context does not provide details about any deep learning models or their development process. Therefore, it cannot be determined if diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods were employed to improve the model's generalizability.
