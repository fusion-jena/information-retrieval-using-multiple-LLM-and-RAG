Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

posite  data,  the  annual  mean  NDVI  data  (January–December),  the 
growing season mean NDVI data (March–November), the spring mean 
NDVI data (March–May), the summer mean NDVI data (June–August), 
and  the  winter  mean  NDVI  data  (September–November)  were

NDVIR = MAX(NDVIi)

(2) 

Among them, NDVIR is the monthly (annual) NDVI value, and NDVI i 

is the value before synthesis. 

2.3.3. NDVI classification analysis 

The Jenks natural breaks optimization method is a statistical tech-
nique designed to determine the optimal classification by maximizing 
the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within clas-
ses, thereby identifying natural groupings in the data (Jenks, 1967). The 
Jenks natural breaks optimization method has been widely applied in 
the classification research of vegetation indices, such as NDVI and Soil 
Adjusted  Vegetation  Index  (SAVI)  classification  research  (Anchang 
et al., 2016; Silva Costa et al., 2023). To accurately compare the dif-
ferences in value sizes between different NDVI products, we used the 
Jenks  natural  breaks  optimization  method  to  divide  the  average  or 
maximum values of four NDVI products at different time scales into six

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this specific query.

However, it should be noted that the context does mention the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classifying NDVI data. This method is not directly related to optimizing hyperparameters but rather focuses on finding optimal classifications based on natural groupings in the data.
