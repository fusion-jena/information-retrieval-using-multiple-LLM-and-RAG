of understory terrain using RGB cameras. In this circumstance, machine 
learning  methods,  such  as  random  forests,  support  vector  machines, 
feature fusion techniques, and neural networks, may be more adept at 
establishing  AGB  equations  through  the  integration  of  UAV-LiDAR, 
hyperspectral,  and  high-resolution  RGB  data  (Brodi´c  et  al.,  2022;

Nevertheless,  the  trees  within  the  study  plot  were  planted  in  pits 
(Fig.  1b),  and  the  generated  DTM  elevates  the  height  of  these  pits, 
leading to a lower H extracted from the CHM compared to the ground- 
measured H (Fig. 6d). During the extraction of individual tree canopy 
boundaries,  ground  cover  classification  based  on  the  DOM  may  yield 
incomplete  canopy  coverage.  However,  by  buffering  the  canopy 
boundaries, the CD obtained from aerial surveys closely matched ground

adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of forest morphological 
characteristics  and  biomass.  However,  the  field  survey  is  time- 
consuming and resource-intensive (Viana et al., 2012).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods or cross-validation to reduce variance, and employing regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting. These strategies help ensure consistent results and improve model performance despite inherent randomness in the training process.
