field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

The MIF block begins with a TA module for local and global feature 
enhancement.  As  is  widely  acknowledged,  the  feature  maps  will  be 
degraded  in  resolution  after  passing  through  a  set  of  deep  neural 
network layers. Such resolution degradation results in a significant loss 
of  saliency-related  information.  So  the  TA module  is  implemented  in 
MIF block  to  address  this  loss.  Our  TA module  is  designed  both  to 
distinguish  the  channel  importance  and  to  emphasize  as  many  infor-
mative textural features as possible with less information loss. The de-
tails of our TA module will be given later in Section 2.2.3.
