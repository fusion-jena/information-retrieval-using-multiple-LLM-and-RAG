Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

provide crystal-clear images for further examination. The added image 
enhancement  technique  enabled  the  proposed  systems  to  reach  high 
accuracy values. 

This  dataset  is  used  after  these  pre-processing  steps  with  the  sug-
gested models. Table 3 presents a comparison between different trained 
deep learning models proposed in this paper. The table shows the five 
different  deep  learning  models  chosen  for  this  application  and  their 
reported  accuracy  and  F1-score.  The  table  also  shows  ten  different

Accuracy

• EfficientNetB0 EfficientNet is a CNN architecture and scaling method 
that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. EfficientNetB0 (Tan 
and Le, 2019) is a network that is trained on more than a million 
images from the ImageNet database.  

• EfficientNetB3 

EfficientNetB3 (Tan and Le, 2019) is another network of the Effi-
cientNet  family.  EfficientNetB3  comes  from  scaling  EfficientNetB0 
which was generated using AutoML.  

• InceptionResNetv2 

InceptionResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) is a CNN network that 
builds on the inception family of architectures. However, the model 
incorporates residual connections instead of the filter concatenation 
stage of the inception family.  

• ResNet50v2 

(Gomez et al., 2017) ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture that 
is  50  layers  deep.  ResNet50v2  is  also  trained  on  a  million  images 
from the ImageNet dataset.

3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that EfficientNetB0 is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. Additionally, ResNet50v2 is mentioned to be trained on a million images from the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, one can infer that the ImageNet dataset has been utilized in the deep learning pipeline. Furthermore, the text discusses a dataset called PlanVillage, but it doesn't explicitly state whether it is used for training or testing purposes. It only mentions that an augmented version of PlanVillage is proposed for use by different researchers for comparison.
