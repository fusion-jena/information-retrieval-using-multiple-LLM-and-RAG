1. Introduction

This will deepen people's understanding of the impacts of climatic fac-
tors  and  human  activities  on  NDVI,  and  provide  effective  technical 
recommendations  for  coping  with  vegetation  problems.  From  the 
perspective of natural and financial development, a series of measures 
should be encouraged to increase vegetation cover, including improving 
rainfall utilization efficiency, adopting biotechnology to improve water 
utilization efficiency, prohibiting overgrazing, and returning farmland 
to forest and grassland.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these are common preprocessing steps often used when preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization typically involves rescaling numeric variables to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Scaling can involve techniques like min-max scaling where values are shifted and rescaled so that they fall within a specified range, usually between 0 and 1. Cleaning data may include handling missing values, removing outliers, or correcting inconsistent data entries. These steps help ensure that the input data is suitable for the deep learning algorithm and can contribute to better performance and more accurate predictions.
