2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

We compared the performance of our method with those of previous 
studies using the IP102 dataset, as shown in Table 3. This table presentes 
the  results  of  both  the  single  models  and  ensemble  methods.  By 
comparing the four basic models in Table 2 with the single models in 
Table  3,  it  is  evident  that  our  trained  basic  models  demonstrated 
impressive performances on the IP102 dataset. For example, our trained 
ResNet-50 exhibited a remarkable improvement of approximately 20% 
in accuracy compared to the results reported by Wu et al. (2019), and 
our  trained  ViT-S/16  outperformed  the  larger-scale  AA-Trans  (Wang 
et al., 2023). This notable enhancement can be primarily attributed to 
the implementation of advanced deep transfer-learning strategies and 
the incorporation of multiple data augmentation techniques. Moreover, 
the performance of Volo-d1 exceeded that of some larger-scale single 
models  and  ensemble  methods.  This  observation  highlights  the

2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Transformer-like models mainly differ from each other due to variations in their token mixer modules. These modules play a crucial role in fusing spatial and channel information within the models. For instance, the token mixer in a Vision Transformer (ViT) is a self-attention module. Another example is the Volo model, which uses the novel Outlook Attention as its token mixer module. This enables fine-grained token representation and the aggregation of global information.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly compare CNNs with traditional machine learning algorithms. However, generally speaking, CNNs offer several advantages over traditional machine learning algorithms. They excel in image classification tasks due to their robust translational invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. Additionally, architectures like ResNet allow for deeper networks, enabling the extraction of more expressive features. As a result, CNNs often demonstrate superior performance in various downstream recognition and detection tasks when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.
