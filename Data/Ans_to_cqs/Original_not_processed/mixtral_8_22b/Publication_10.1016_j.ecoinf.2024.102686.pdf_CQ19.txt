, j ∈ Sk(t)

(4) 

In Eq. (4), η(t) is the learning rate, which decreases with time t, and 

Sk(t) is the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t.  

(5)  The process is repeated using a new input vector. 

2.4.4. Clustering quality index (CQI) 

Owing to the characteristics of unsupervised clustering of SOM net-
works,  changing  the  number  of  categories  significantly  affects  the 
clustering results, and determining the number of categories is the key to

(1)  Initialization is performed, with a small random initial value (wij) 
being assigned to the connection weights of N input and output 
neurons  and  an  initial  neighborhood  being  set  for  each  output 
neuron j.  

(2)  A new input sample vector (X) is provided.  
(3)  The Euclidean distances (dj) between the input sample and each 
output  neuron  j  are  calculated,  and  the  neuron  (k)  with  the 
minimum distance is the winning output unit.

In Eq. (3), X is the input sample vector, Wj  is the weight vector, N is 
the number of input neurons, xi is the ith input neuron, wij is the random 
initial value of the connection weight between the ith and jth neurons, 
and t is time.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
