Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.3. Parameter setting 

The experiments were performed using GPU acceleration to expedite 
computations.  The  models  were  initialized  with  pre-trained  weights 
obtained from the ‘imagenet’ dataset. To tailor the models to the specific

5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments. 

5.1.5. Total layers in the model

Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) allows computing on 
the GPU, making it easier for users to develop GPU programs. This en-
ables faster and more efficient computing by utilizing the power of the 
Graphics  Processing  Unit  (GPU).  Tahmasebi  et  al.  (Tahmasebi  et  al., 
2020) uses the GPU computation with NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU for ra-
diation therapy was studied, demonstrating a five-fold improvement in 
efficiency compared to working with a Central Processing Unit (CPU). 
Another approach, as discussed in the article (De Cea-Dominguez et al., 
2020), utilizes Nvidia GPU with four CUDA kernels for video compres-
sion,  optimizing  the  memory  usage  and  resulting  in  superior  perfor-
mance compared to JPEG2000 and HEVC/H.265 compression methods. 
Usually,  when  a  leaf  is  infected  by  many  diseases,  it  develops 
symptoms that cannot be differentiated from other diseases. Noon et al.

The exceptional performance of MobileNet-GRU can be attributed to 
the combination of the lightweight MobileNet architecture, which has 
only 20,009,154 parameters and requires 918.23 s for training, and the 
temporal  modeling  capabilities  of  GRU.  The  GRU  model  itself,  with 
183,298  parameters  and  8  layers,  requires  a  longer  training  time 
(183,298 s), indicating its complexity despite fewer parameters. Mobi-
leNet  is  designed  to  be  computationally  efficient,  making  it  ideal  for 
deployment on devices with limited resources. It achieves this efficiency 
through the use of depthwise separable convolutions, reducing both the 
number of parameters and computational cost while preserving impor-
tant features.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The experiments for training the deep learning model were performed using GPU acceleration to expedite computations. Specifically, the text mentions the use of NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU for radiation therapy and Nvidia GPU with four CUDA kernels for video compression. These examples suggest that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include GPUs. Additionally, the mention of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) further supports the use of GPUs, as CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia. However, there is no explicit mention of TPUs or any other specific hardware resources being used for training the deep learning model.
