As deep learning continues to flourish, a myriad of researchers has 
pivoted  their  focus  towards  animal  individual  recognition,  aiming  to 
gain  deeper  insights  into  animal  behavior,  growth  status,  and  more. 
However,  the  pursuit  of  animal  individual  recognition  necessitates  a 
substantial  dataset  of  animal  images,  and  acquiring  such  datasets  is 
often challenging. To overcome the hurdle of dataset collection, Ferreira 
et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously gathers training 
data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for their study on small bird individual recognition. This 
approach  alleviates  the  need  for  manual  annotation  and  independent 
neural network training.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that there is a scarcity of databases for live underwater fish individuals, which poses a significant challenge in the field. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors did not find any suitable data repository for their research. It would be best to contact the authors or refer to the original paper for further information regarding the availability of the data repository.
