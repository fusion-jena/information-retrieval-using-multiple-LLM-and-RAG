RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6. 
and then compared it with the state-of-the-art 
approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy.

containing  64  different  element  vectors  of 
plants in a set of 100 distinct classes of plant 
species.  Several  state-of  the-  art  model 
architectures were trained, with the proposed 
model  attaining  performance  of  95.06% 
success rate in identifying the corresponding 
plant  species.  The  significant  success  rate 
makes the model very useful identifier or/and

real ecosystem services.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer from the results section that the authors measured the performance of their proposed model after each epoch. An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire dataset, where the model sees every sample once. After each epoch, they likely calculated the accuracy of the model on a validation set to track its progress over time. This allowed them to observe how well the model was learning and whether it was improving or not. Additionally, they may have monitored other metrics such as loss, precision, recall, and F1 score to gain more insights into the model's performance. Without additional details, this is our best guess based on common practices in deep learning research.
