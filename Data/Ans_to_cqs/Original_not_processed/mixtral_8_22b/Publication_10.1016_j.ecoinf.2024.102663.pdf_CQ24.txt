Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

1. Introduction 

Fish biomass estimation is essential for the fisheries and aquaculture 
industries  (Li  et  al.,  2020).  Manual  methods  of  estimation  can  be 
strenuous for the fish. Thus, there is a need for non-intrusive methods of 
fish  biomass  estimation.  Biomass  estimation  in  a  turbid  environment 
also comes with several challenges. This is where deep learning can play 
a  vital  role.  Training  a  deep  learning  model  on  large  datasets  of  fish 
images  can  provide  accurate  biomass  estimates  without  causing  un-
necessary  strain  to  the  fish  and  minimizes  manual  effort.  Hence,  the 
motivation of this research lies in providing an efficient, precise, and 
cost-effective  method  for  estimating  fish  biomass  in  turbid  environ-
ments. The reliance on fishing and aquaculture is a prominent charac-
teristic of numerous societies, playing a substantial role in bolstering the 

economic and social vitality of various nations and locations.

1.  Draw a bootstrap sample of the dataset.  
2.  Grow  a  decision  tree  from  the  bootstrap  sample.  At  each  node:  a. 
Randomly  select  a  subset  of  features.  b.  Determine  the  best  split 
based on these features.  

3.  Repeat the process for each new node until a stopping criterion is 

met.  

4.  Aggregate predictions from all the trees for the final prediction. 

The following section describes the materials and methods involved 
in the system, including dataset details, proposed methodology, training 
procedure,  and  performance  evaluation  parametersâ€”the  section 
following  that  tabulates  the  results  and  discussion,  followed  by  the 
conclusion and references.

Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  deep  learning  techniques  to  pre-
processing under extreme conditions such as low light, extreme occlu-
sion, or overlapping of fish can address unique challenges by tailoring 
datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these 
datasets. Incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe (Abualigah et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2020) embeddings could enhance the detection and 
classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and 
semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass esti-
mates. Continuing to modify the architecture of deep learning models 
like YOLO, to better suit specific requirements, includes altering various 
parts of the architecture as needed to handle different environmental 
factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, one common strategy used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness is setting a fixed seed value before running experiments. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across multiple runs of the same experiment.

Additionally, another approach to handling randomness is using ensemble methods like Random Forest Regressor, mentioned in the context. Ensemble methods combine multiple base learners to improve overall performance and reduce variance caused by randomness. In the case of Random Forest Regressor, it uses bagging (bootstrap aggregating), where each tree in the forest is trained on a randomly sampled subset of data points and features. This introduces controlled randomness into the model, allowing it to capture diverse patterns and generalize well to unseen data.

While the context does not directly discuss strategies for managing randomness related to seed values, it highlights the importance of employing robust algorithms like Random Forest Regressor to mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance.
