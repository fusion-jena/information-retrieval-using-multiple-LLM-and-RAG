that would include a map and sighting data (40%); to create a poster and 
other dissemination material (40%), and; to advertise the program and 
participating  dive  centres  on  social  media  (20%).  The  taxa  that  were 
most frequently requested included: Batoidea (e.g., butterfly ray, com-
mon  eagle  ray),  Aulostomus  strigosus  (Atlantic  trumpetfish),  Seriola 
Dumerili  (Greater  amberjack),  Sphyraena  sphyraena  (European  barra-

dive  plan.  Additionally,  the  app  also  collects  metadata  on  location,  number  of  dives  and  number  of  divers 
enabling normalisation based on “sampling effort”. In this pilot study, the use of the app was tested to compile 
information on the frequency and abundance of 18 marine taxa selected by local experts based on their con-
servation  status,  commercial  interest,  ecological  function  and/or  their  non-indigenous  origin.  Additionally,  a 
question-based survey was conducted to assess the opinion of users on the app’s usability and the potential value 
for the diving community/industry, showcasing a high usability score and interest among users. Basic statistical 
analysis of the data crowdsourced over the 1-month trial illustrates the potential and value of regional moni-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs were utilized for training the deep learning model.
