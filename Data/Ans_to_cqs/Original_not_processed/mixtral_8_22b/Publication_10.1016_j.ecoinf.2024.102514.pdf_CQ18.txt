2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

Fig. 2. Methodological framework for selecting the best predictive model.

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the methodology used to select the best predictive model involves monitoring its performance during both training and testing phases. During the training phase, several performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and others are calculated to evaluate the accuracy of predictions made by different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. It can be observed from Fig. 9 that the majority of these performance indicators were found to be higher during the training period. However, during the testing period, model performance was shown to have greatly improved, possibly due to the issue of underfitting (as mentioned in Table S4 - supplementary data). Additionally, it has been noted that the lowest prediction errors during both training and testing periods belonged to specific ML algorithms like GPR, LR, NN, and SVM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training primarily focuses on evaluating the accuracy of predictions using multiple performance metrics and comparing them across different ML algorithms.
