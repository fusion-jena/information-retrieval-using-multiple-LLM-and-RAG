5.4. Application to the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees 

Counting the number of pollen-bearing bees entering the hive enables beekeepers to monitor the 

hive’s food status and promptly replenish it if necessary. Recognizing this benefit, we integrated

VnPollenBee dataset. The best metrics values are shown in bold font.

Consequently, focal loss diminishes the impact of straightforward samples on training loss 

while  amplifying  the  significance  of  challenging  ones.  The  focal  loss  function  is  calculated  as

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used techniques such as grid search or random search.
