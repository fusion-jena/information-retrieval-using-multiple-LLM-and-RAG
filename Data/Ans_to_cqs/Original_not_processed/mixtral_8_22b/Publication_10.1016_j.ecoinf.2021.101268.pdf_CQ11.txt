2. Peruvian Amazon forestry dataset

Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

validation samples are selected randomly from the first group. The data 
distribution is 70.12% for training, 1.69% validation, and 28.19% for 
testing. The model feeds off with 16 elements per mini-batches using the 
ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 1e-3. To 
run our experiments, we use Pytorch 1.3 framework in a PC with the 
following specifications: 4.0 GHz Intel Core i9 processor, 32 GB 3000 
MHz DDR4 memory, and NVIDIA Titan RTX. 

5. Results

Skip connections mitigate singularities related to the deactivation of 
units, breaking the linear dependence of the network (Orhan and Pit-
kow, 2018). Residual connections are useful to explore different levels of 
features maps in complex datasets since mid to high-level abstractions. 
However,  our  qualitative  evaluation  suggests  that  skip  connections 
could add noise in scan/pseudo scan leaf classification.
