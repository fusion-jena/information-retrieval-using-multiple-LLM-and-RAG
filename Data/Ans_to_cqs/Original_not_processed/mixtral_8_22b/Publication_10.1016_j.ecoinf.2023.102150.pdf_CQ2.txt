training  data  set. The  models were  trained on  a  cloud  service  with  1 
GPU,  4  CPUs  and  16  GB  RAM  provided  by  Sigma2  -  the  National 
Infrastructure  for  High  Performance  Computing  and  Data  Storage  in 
Norway. 

We evaluated the model performance on the validation data set and 
the  out-of-sample  test  data  set  by  calculating  model  accuracy  as  the 
number of correct predictions divided by the number of all images as 
well as precision, recall and F1 score for each class (Appendix B):

The complete workflow is performed in the statistical software R (R 
Core Team, 2022), a programming language used by most ecologists (Lai 
et  al.,  2019).  Thus,  the  use  of  R  instead  of  python,  the  leading  pro-
gramming language for deep learning tasks (Raschka et al., 2020), will 
likely  lower  the  threshold  for  ecologist  of  implementing  automatic 
image classification in their workflows. Most available frameworks for 
automatic  image  classification  come  as  tools  with  a  graphical  user 
interface or as R packages. Such tools and packages are designed to be 
user-friendly with the aim to make machine learning models available 
for  ecologists  without  programming  experience  (Tabak  et  al.,  2020). 
However,  they  are  often  difficult  to  modify  and  researchers  are  then 
obliged to develop their own tool for their specific needs instead of using 
existing ones. Thus, we provide R-scripts for all steps of the workflow,

To overcome the challenge of manually processing huge amounts of 
data, artificial intelligence is increasingly used in ecology, for example 
to  automate  the  classification  of  camera  trap  images  (Christin  et  al., 
2019). Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning models that 
have proven to be especially useful for image recognition (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012) and have been applied for animal detection and classifi-
cation with great success (e.g. Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 
2019; Willi et al., 2019; Zualkernan et al., 2022). These models can for 
example separate empty images from images containing an animal (e.g. 
Beery et al., 2019), identify species, count individuals, and categorize 
animal behaviour with an accuracy that matches or even outperforms 
humans (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). However, developing and training 
neural  networks require  programming  skills  and  have  therefore  often

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, such as references to camera trap images, true positives, false positives, and false negatives, which are common terms used in image analysis. Additionally, there are no explicit mentions of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
