2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

modern farming to get insight into the daily practices of its processes. 
Therefore,  the  phrase  “farming”,  “agriculture”,“  smart  farming”,  and 
“precision  agriculture”  are  our  main  phrases  to  combine  with  the 
“reference architecture”. The next step is identifying the recent trends in 
data  management.  According  to  Giray  and  Catal  (Giray  and  Catal, 
2021),  big  data,  machine  learning,  and  data  lake  are  emerging  tech-
nologies that evolved from traditional data management in recent years. 
Based on their research, this study adopts the phrases used to represent 
data management and combines them with the other phrases explained 
earlier. This search strategy has been applied in the Scopus database to 
collect  the  papers.  To  assure  sufficient  coverage,  the  manual  search 
method was also conducted.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context alone whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework is being used to develop these models. Further details would be required to accurately determine the frameworks utilized for building the deep learning models discussed in the paper.
