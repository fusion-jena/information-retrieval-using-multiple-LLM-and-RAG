Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

In  contrast,  deep  learning  methods,  while  powerful,  often  require 
large  datasets  and  substantial  computational  resources.  They  can  be 
prone  to  overfitting,  especially  when  the  available  data  is  limited  or 
noisy, as is often the case in aquaculture environments. be less inter-
pretable, making understanding the underlying decision-making process 
challenging. RNNs, although proficient in handling sequential data, may 
struggle  with  the  complex  and  noisy  environmental  data  typical  in 
aquaculture settings. Additionally, RNNs are more prone to overfitting 
and  may  require  more  computational  resources.  Whereas  attenuation 
mechanism methods might struggle with the multifaceted and dynamic 
nature of the aquaculture system.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks to increase the size of training sets by creating modified versions of images from existing ones. However, since the context focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in water rather than image processing, these specific techniques might not apply directly. Instead, other forms of data preprocessing and manipulation could have been employed, such as normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical features, or applying feature engineering techniques. Without further details, it's impossible to provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques used in this particular scenario.
