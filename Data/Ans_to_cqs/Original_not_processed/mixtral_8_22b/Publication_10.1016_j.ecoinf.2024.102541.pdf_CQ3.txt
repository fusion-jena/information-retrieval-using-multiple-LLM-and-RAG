Fig. 11. The top-left segment displays instance maps, indicating object locations in the input image with unique colours corresponding to each object’s bounding 
box. The top-right segment features a label map, categorizing objects with distinct colours that match their bounding boxes. In the bottom-left, the mask map reveals 
segmentation masks for each object, highlighting the regions within the bounding boxes. Bottom-right segment presents a heatmap overlaying the input image, where 
brighter pixels signify higher network confidence in object.

Helpful Answer:
The text provides several clues about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. These include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image and assigning them labels. It is used to train models for tasks such as object detection and localization. The FishMarket dataset mentioned in Table 5 has been annotated using this technique, as indicated by the presence of bounding boxes in Figures 11 and 13.

Instance Segmentation: Instance segmentation goes beyond bounding box annotation by not only identifying individual objects but also delineating their exact boundaries. This technique is useful for applications like autonomous driving or medical imaging where precise object identification is critical. Figure 11 shows how instance maps can be used to indicate object locations with unique colors corresponding to each object's bounding box. Similarly, Figure 13 demonstrates how label maps can categorize objects with distinct colors matching their respective bounding boxes.

Semantic Segmentation: Unlike instance segmentation which differentiates between instances of the same class, semantic segmentation focuses on understanding what type of thing is present at every pixel location without distinguishing between separate entities. Mask maps revealed in Figure 11 illustrate this concept by displaying segmentation masks for each object, thereby highlighting the regions within the bounding boxes.

In summary, the given context suggests that various data annotation techniques have been employed in the deep learning pipeline. These include bounding box annotation for object detection and localization, instance segmentation for precise object identification, and semantic segmentation for understanding the overall scene composition.
