Whatever the goal, our framework is highly flexible and can be adapted by tuning the species thresholds 
regulating the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage in an attempt to monitor biodiversity 
through big datasets where species are unidentified. To unclog the bottleneck of information extraction about 
organism forms, behaviors and sounds from massive digital data, machine learning algorithms, and particularly 
the last generation of deep learning algorithms, offer immense promises. Here we propose to help the users to 
control their error rates in ecology. This is a valuable addition to the ecologist’s toolkit towards a routine and 
robust analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors. With this control of error 
rate in the hands of users, Deep Learning Algorithms can be used for real applications, with acceptable and

Processing data from surveys using photos or videos remains a major bottleneck in ecology. Deep 
Learning Algorithms (DLAs) have been increasingly used to automatically identify organisms on 
images. However, despite recent advances, it remains difficult to control the error rate of such 
methods. Here, we proposed a new framework to control the error rate of DLAs. More precisely, 
for each species, a confidence threshold was automatically computed using a training dataset 
independent from the one used to train the DLAs. These species-specific thresholds were then used to 
post-process the outputs of the DLAs, assigning classification scores to each class for a given image 
including a new class called “unsure”. We applied this framework to a study case identifying 20 fish 
species from 13,232 underwater images on coral reefs. The overall rate of species misclassification 
decreased from 22% with the raw DLAs to 2.98% after post-processing using the thresholds defined to

Material and methods
Data.  We decided to build our own dataset instead of using existing datasets (e.g. Fish4Knowledge: https ://
group s.inf.ed.ac.uk/f4k/), to be in phase with quality of videos currently used by marine ecologists. We used 3 
independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test our CNN 
model and our post processing method. For the 3 datasets, we used fish images extracted from 175 underwa-
ter high-definition videos which lasted between 5 and 21 min for a total of 83 h. The videos were recorded in 
1920 × 1,080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3 + black and Hero 4 + black. The videos were recorded between 2 and 30 m 
deep, with a broad range of luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and bar-
rier reefs.

Helpful Answer:
The authors of the paper built their own dataset instead of using existing ones like Fish4Knowledge. They collected raw data through underwater high-definition videos recorded in various depths, luminosities, and environments on fringing and barrier reefs around Mayotte Island in the Western Indian Ocean. The videos were captured using GoPro Hero 3+ Black and Hero 4+ Black cameras. From these videos, they extracted fish images to create three independent datasets for training and testing their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and post-processing method.
