Category wise performance analysis: From Tables 2 and 3, the category 
wise performance analysis of baseline through evaluation metrics with 
respect to mel spectrogram and mel MFCC can be seen. Table 2 consist of 
values observed for mel spectrogram input, among which the bird spe-
cies house sparrow category achieved highest in hybrid baseline model 
and wood pewee category achieved highest in attention-based hybrid 
model.  The  higher  deviation  of  identifying  bird  species  leads  to  poor 
performance  of  the  model.  The  performance  of  baseline  techniques 
using MFCC features are better when compared with mel spectrogram 
(shown in Table 3).

may learn spatial and temporal characteristics, which are important in 
applications like speech recognition and machine translation. Further-
more, because the two may supply complementing information to one 
another, CNN-LSTM models can learn complicated patterns from data 
more rapidly and correctly than either CNN or LSTM models alone.

5. Results and discussion 

The performance evaluation  metrics like  precision,  recall, and  F1- 
score are used to analyze the robustness of proposed Wav2Vec model. 
The formulation for evaluation metrics are mentioned in (5)â€“(7), which 
are calculated from predicted multi-labels for the overlapped bird calls 
audio from test dataset. For performance comparison, two most relevant 
baseline techniques like hybrid CNN-LSTM and Attention based hybrid 
CNN-LSTM  are  taken.  The  source  code  for  proposed  wav2vec  trans-
former model over considered bird species dataset has been uploaded in 
the  open-source  (Link:  https://github.com/simplyjaga/Bird-Species

respectively, demonstrating that their model has greater generalization

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both measures. These metrics are used to calculate the performance of the proposed Wav2Vec model for classifying overlapping bird call audio from a test dataset. Two baseline techniques, namely hybrid CNN-LSTM and attention-based hybrid CNN-LSTM, were also used for performance comparison.
