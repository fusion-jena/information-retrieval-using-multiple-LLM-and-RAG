number  of  transformed  spectrograms,  adversely  affecting  the  classifi-
cation accuracy of CNN models. To improve the accuracy of birdsong 
classification, data augmentation (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019) can 
be used to enhance the dataset and introduce the dynamic convolutional 
kernel structure to improve the network feature extraction ability.

The low classification accuracy of the neural network caused by the 
lack of birdsong spectrogram data can be solved by data augmentation 
of ACGAN. In addition, we can improve the feature extraction capability 
of the network by increasing its depth. However, increasing the network 
depth  may  lead  to  overfitting  and  require  significant  computational 
resources.  Some  researchers  have  proposed  dynamic  convolution  to 
solve  those  problems,  using  a  set  of  K  parallel  convolution  kernels 
instead  of  a  single  convolution  kernel  per  layer.  These  parallel  con-
volutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention. The atten-
tion  dynamically  adjusts  the  weight  of  each  convolution  kernel 
according to the input, thus generating an adaptive dynamic convolu-
tion. Experiments results show that this structure achieved a 2.9% gain 
in the Imagenet classification task and an AP gain of 2.9 in CoCo Key-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repository links related to the deep learning pipelines mentioned such as MobileNetV2, ResNet18, VGG16, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It would be helpful if more context or details were provided about the specific datasets or repositories being referred to in order to give a more accurate response.
