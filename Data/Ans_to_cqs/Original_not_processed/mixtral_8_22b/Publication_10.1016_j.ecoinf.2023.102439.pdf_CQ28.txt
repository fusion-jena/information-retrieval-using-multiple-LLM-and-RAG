2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

On  the  other  hand,  the  significant  processing  time  required  to 
generate  precise  LULC  maps  via  satellite  image  processing  remains  a 
primary  challenge  for  remote  sensing  researchers.  This  challenge  is 
particularly pronounced when dealing with medium-resolution satellite 
images like Landsat data. Extensive research has shown that artificial 
neural network models effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency 
of LULC mapping using remote sensing data. Extensive studies have used 
artificial neural network models to map land use and land cover with 
remote sensing data to improve accuracy and efficiency (Alshari et al.,

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
