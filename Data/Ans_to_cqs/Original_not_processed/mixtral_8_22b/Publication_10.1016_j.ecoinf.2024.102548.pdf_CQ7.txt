5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments. 

5.1.5. Total layers in the model

classification tasks. The evaluation of model performance was based on 
the  accuracy  metric.  Each  model  underwent  training  for  10  epochs, 
utilizing  a  batch  size  of  32.  The  class  mode  was  set  to  ‘categorical,’ 
indicating  that  the  labels  were  encoded  using  one-hot  encoding  for 
multi-class  classification  tasks.  These  generalized  parameter  settings 
were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and 
standardization throughout the study experiments.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling method to divide the dataset into these subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the test set evaluates the final model's performance after training and tuning. Common ratios for splitting datasets include 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
