The  training  set,  comprising  the  majority  of  the  data  (82%),  con-
taining 4000 images, is used to train the model and adjust its parame-
ters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in 
the data. The validation set (13%), consisting of 607 images, is utilized 
during  training  to  fine-tune  hyperparameters  and  assess  the  model's 
performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring 
generalization. Lastly, the testing set (5%), which included 260 images, 
serves  as  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  model's  performance  on 
completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world 
effectiveness and ability to generalize. 

2.3. Performance evaluation 

To evaluate the ablated model results, we use five metrics, namely 
Precision (Eq. (1)), Recall (Eq. (2)), mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, related to 
Eq. (3), Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms) and Time(h).

We  also  consider  Params  and  FLOPs  to  evaluate  the  model.  The 
“Params”  metric  in  a  neural  network  model  refers  to  the  number  of 
learned variables used for making predictions. It is an essential metric 
for  evaluating  the  model's  complexity  and  computational  efficiency. 
Models  with  more  parameters  generally  require  more  resources  for

Performance  parameters  such  as  inference  time  (in  ms)  and  time 
taken for training (in hours) are critical metrics for evaluating the effi-
ciency of YOLO models. Inference time measures the speed at which the 
model  processes  input  data  and  produces  output  predictions.  It  is 
essential  to  minimize  inference  time  for  real-time  applications  where 
speed  is  crucial,  such  as  real-time  object  detection  in  videos.  On  the 
other hand, time taken for training measures how long it takes for the 
model to learn from the training data and improve its accuracy. This 
metric is essential for measuring the overall training efficiency of the 
YOLO model. Considering these two parameters when selecting a YOLO 
model  for  a  particular  use  case  is  essential,  as  they  can  impact  the 
model's performance and computational cost.

It is worth noting, however, that increasing the network depth also 
comes with some potential downsides, such as increased computational 
complexity and a greater risk of overfitting the model to the training 
data. So, adding the P2 layer to the YOLOv8 architecture is a tradeoff 
that needs to be carefully balanced with other considerations, such as 
model size and performance requirements. In this sense, we proposed in 
this work a modification in the C2f layer due to its importance in the 
general architecture of YOLOv8, in the sense of making it lighter and 
counterbalancing  the  increase  obtained  with  the  addition  of  the  P2 
feature level layer. In our work, we call this new layer C2f2.

Helpful Answer:
During the training process, the model's performance is monitored using a validation set, which comprises 13% of the total data or 607 images. This validation set is employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and gauge the model's effectiveness on previously unseen data. By doing so, the risk of overfitting is mitigated, and the model's capacity to generalize is ensured. Additionally, the testing set, accounting for 5% of the total data or 260 images, serves as an independent assessment of the model's performance on completely unseen data. This provides a dependable indicator of the model's real-world proficiency and adaptability. To further evaluate the model's performance, several metrics are considered, including Precision, Recall, mAP0.5, mAP0.5:0.95, Params(M), Flops(G), Inference(ms), and Time(h). These metrics help determine the model's precision, recall rate, mean average precision, computational efficiency, and processing speed.
