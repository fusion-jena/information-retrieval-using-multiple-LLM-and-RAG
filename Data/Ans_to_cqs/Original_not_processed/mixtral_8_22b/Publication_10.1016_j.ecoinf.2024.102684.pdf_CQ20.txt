We applied the  standard machine learning hyperparameter  search 
over  two  sites  because  of  computational  cost.  In  our  research,  we 
considered the activation function, the optimizer, and the learning rate. 
In addition, we performed an exhaustive search for the fully connected 
architecture for all mono-site and multi-site models. In all these cases, 
we compare the training, validation, and testing performance to avoid 
overfitting.  We  could  have  achieved  the  same  results  using  hyper-
parameter search software such as Optuna and Sklearn. However, even 
though they could save coding time, we prefer to control every aspect of 
the process to avoid problems. The hyperparameter search involved a 
small grid search selecting the following hyperparameters and values:  

1.  Hidden activation function: ReLU, sigmoid, or elu,  
2.  Optimizer: RMSprop or adam  
3.  Learning rate: 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001.

of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

2.  Second,  we  evaluated  the  predictions  from  all  generated  models, 
spanning various fully connected architectures. These models differ in 
the number of layers and neurons because we explored up to three 
layers with 8, 16, 32, and 64 neurons per layer. Thus, we explored up 
to  12  models  per  experiment,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1(e).  Here,  we 
selected the model with the highest R2  value based on the transfer 
learning evaluation dataset. This model is denoted as modelt  since its 
selection  is  anchored on  the  transfer  learning data.  This  approach 
might  not  always  be  feasible  in  real-world  applications,  given  the 
necessity of labels in the new domain. However, we employed this 
‘optimized model’ evaluation to discern the performance differences 
between modelv  and modelt. 

2.7. Model spatial autocorrelation

Pre-trained  networks  offer  architectures  with  various  convolution 
operations that allow them to extract patterns within the images effi-
ciently.  After  the  convolutional  layers  of  pre-trained  networks,  it  is 
necessary to add a fully connected network architecture, also known as 
multi-layer perceptron. These layers are usually located at the end, and 
are responsible for reproducing the predictions of the final output. We 
compared different fully connected network architectures, exploring up 
to  three  hidden  layers  with  8,  16,  32,  and  64  neurons  in  each  layer. 
Consequently,  we  generated  12  models  for  each  dataset  trained  with 
different fully connected architectures. The output layer consisted of a 
single  neuron  with  a  sigmoid  activation  function,  producing  invasion 
predictions between 0.0 and 1.0.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that conducting large cross-validation experiments with deep learning-based models is often infeasible due to their high computational costs. This suggests that the authors likely utilized some form of advanced computing resources, possibly including GPUs or TPUs, to train their deep learning models efficiently.
