4.3. Data processing

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

4.4. Classification method

this study to filter classification features, securing the optimal feature 
combination for the classification process. This approach is projected to 
considerably reduce data redundancy, thereby enhancing classification 
accuracy and efficiency.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format(s) are used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they mentioned "high-resolution remote sensing data" and "feature information", we can infer that they might be using image or raster data formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG, etc. These types of data are commonly associated with remote sensing applications. Additionally, since they discuss feature optimization tools and classification methods, it suggests that they could also be working with vector data formats like shapefiles or geodatabases containing spatial attributes. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the text, I cannot definitively state the exact data formats used in their deep learning pipeline.
