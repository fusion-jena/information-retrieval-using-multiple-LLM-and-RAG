time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets with relevant metadata or tags, which can be used to train machine learning models. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images, while semantic segmentation assigns each pixel in an image to a class label. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects and their boundaries. Polygon annotation is similar to bounding boxes but uses irregular shapes to outline objects more precisely. Key point annotation marks specific points on objects, such as joints on humans or animals, while landmark annotation identifies significant features like facial features or building structures.
