leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

2022) conducted a study that proposed a Convolutional Neural Network 
model  to  identify  the  plant  species.  The  five  medicinal  plants  of  750 
image samples are collected using a box model that is subjected to initial 
preprocessing of resize, segmentation, and augmentation to increase the 
sample size. (Malik et al., 2022) proposed a deep learning-based method 
to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. The chal-
lenges associated with real-time image acquisition conditions must be 
meticulously addressed to improve the accuracy of the real-time clas-
sification systems. In recognizing multiple disease varieties in a single 
crop,  a  few  significant  contributions  reported  include  deep  learning 
models  by  (Wang  et  al.,  2022;  Bi  et  al.,  2022;  Sennan  et  al.,  2022; 
L´opez-Jim´enez et al., 2019) for soybean cultivars, Maize seed varieties,

Additionally, the results are also supported by the work (Barr´e et al., 
2017) where an accuracy of 86.3% is achieved towards top five classes 
on  Leafsnap  dataset  using  Leafnet  deep  learning  model  that  employs 
convolution features. In a similar work, multi class disease classification 
with respect to six classes of plants comprising of twenty-seven diseases, 
a multi-layered convolutional network is proposed (Tiwari et al., 2021) 
and obtained about 99.09% accuracy.

samples in GSL100 would also help in the extensibility of the developing 
a deep learning model that works on multiple levels.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information regarding the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies utilizing deep learning models for various applications related to plant species identification and disease detection. These studies employ techniques like dimensionality reduction with ESPCA (Barhate et al., 2023) and batch updated stochastic gradient descent (Barhate et al., 2023). Additionally, some research uses preprocessing steps like resize, segmentation, and augmentation to increase sample sizes (2022). While these methods may indirectly contribute to preventing overfitting, they are not explicitly mentioned as regularization techniques. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide detailed information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
