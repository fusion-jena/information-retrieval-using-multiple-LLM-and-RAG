vegetation growth cycle included in the training samples.

While building the RF model, the training samples were randomly 
divided  according  to  proportions  of  80%  and  20%  and  used  for  the 
training and test datasets, respectively. The parameters of the RF model, 
number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and 
number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features) 
significantly affected  the  accuracy and  complexity  of  the model.  This 
study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag 
(OOB)  error  and  five-fold  cross-validation  to  search  for  the  optimal 
parameters  of  the  model  (Chang  et  al.,  2023).  The  n_estimators  were 
spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is 2, 5, 10, 
20, and 50. The max_features were spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 
1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.

period  of  lush  vegetation.  Therefore,  the  selected  training  samples 
lacked low-value LAI samples, resulting in a lack of training in this part 
of the RF model, which could not predict low-value LAI accurately.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to monitor the model performance during training. This approach helps in searching for the optimal parameters of the model. The n\_estimators are spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is set to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50. The max\_features are spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.
