Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about which specific framework or library was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that MATLAB R2014b was used to create a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network. Therefore, we can infer that MATLAB was the primary tool employed to develop this particular deep learning model.

MATLAB is a high-level programming language and numerical computing environment widely used for scientific computing, data analysis, algorithm development, modeling, simulation, image processing, and more. It provides built-in functions and toolboxes for machine learning and deep learning tasks, including support for creating and training neural networks like the one described in the given context.
