The LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as 
loss function and the ADAM optimization (Kingma and Ba (2015)). To 
avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added. The dropout layer, described 
¨
by 
Ozgür  and  Nar  (2020),  is  a  regularization  method  that  randomly 
excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training 
a network. Inputs not set to zero are scaled up by 1/(1 (cid:0) rate) such that 
the  sum  over  all  inputs  remains  the  same.  The  training  set  is  pre-
processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling 
it  to  a  [0–1]  range.  The  dimension  of  the  temporal  window  must  be 
selected  dynamically  considering  the  performance  obtained  with 
different values on the available dataset.

the distribution of values in the training is more similar to the one of the 
test period. However, when LSTM is performing better than VR + SVR, 
the gain in performance is more significant. 

In  terms  of  bias,  the  results  are  good  for  both  NO  and  NO2.  The 
precision of sensors 4005, 4007, 4009, and 4012 is very low for both NO 
and NO2. Sensor 4006 shows a high precision error only for NO. The 
other sensors have very good performances, even reaching the regula-
tory  monitoring  required  performances.  This  is  an  important  result, 
considering that the mean value of the NO concentrations during the test 
period  (17.22  μg/m3)  was  beyond  the  noise  limit  of  the  cell  (18.75 
μg/m3). The mean concentration of NO is low because the test periods 
are during the co-location near the background station which is located 
in a green area far away from the most relevant source of pollution, such 
as road traffic.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the use of specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have employed certain strategies to handle potential biases or imbalances in their datasets.

One common technique mentioned indirectly is the use of a MinMaxScaler for preprocessing the input features. While this doesn't directly address data bias, it does help normalize the data, ensuring that no single feature dominates the others due to its scale. Normalizing the data can also improve the overall performance of machine learning models.

Additionally, the mention of stratified sampling in the context of selecting the training and testing sets suggests that the authors may have considered class balance when partitioning the data. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets reflects the original dataset, thus reducing any potential bias introduced by skewed class distributions.

Although not explicitly stated, other techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection could potentially be applied depending on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed. These methods aim to mitigate issues related to class imbalance or limited representation of certain subgroups within the data.

Overall, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively state which specific techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the use of MinMaxScaler and possible application of stratified sampling suggest that the authors took steps to ensure balanced and normalized data for optimal model performance.
