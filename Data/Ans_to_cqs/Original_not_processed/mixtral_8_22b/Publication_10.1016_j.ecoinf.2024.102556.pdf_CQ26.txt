As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

In the initial algorithm, MSNet constructs the FEN by stacking rule 
residual blocks to capture the appearance information. However, owing 
to the depth and structure of the network, the original residual network 
can only  extract  shallow  features, and  it  is  challenging  to extract  the 
deeper features of the target. The shallow network is adept at capturing 
the target’s location and appearance information, but struggles to pro-
vide detailed target information. To address the occlusion challenges in 
MOT scenarios, it is imperative to introduce deeper networks. However, 
the multiple downsampling stages in these deeper networks result in a 
lower resolution for the final feature map layer, which diminishes the 
effectiveness of the information for small targets in the output feature

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

proposed  model  stems  from  the  urgent  need  for  complex  monitoring 
tools in high-altitude areas with limited computing resources, complex 
tracking scenarios, and unsatisfactory tracking accuracy. Our model is 
an  efficient  representative  model,  particularly  when  the  target  is 
occluded for a long time and frequently enters and exits the field-of-view 
of a UAV camera.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. Oversampling increases the size of underrepresented classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the size of overrepresented classes by removing samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different variations within each class. These techniques can help improve the performance and generalization of deep learning models by reducing data bias and ensuring fair representation across classes.
