Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

The basic models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strat-
egy based on fine-tuning. The model parameters were initialized using a 
pre-trained model. The final classification layer was then replaced by a 
fully connected layer, aligning its output dimension with the number of 
classes  in  the  target  dataset.  Subsequently,  all  parameters  across  the 
layers were fine-tuned on the target dataset. The basic models in all the 

The  performances  of  the  four  basic  models  and  two  proposed 
ensemble  methods  on  the  IP102  dataset  are  lised  in  Table  2.  The 
parameter  sizes  of  the  four  basic  models  were  comparable,  with 
approximately 24 M parameters for each model. However, there was a 
significant variation in the performances of the basic models, as shown 
in Table 2. ViP-Small/7 exhibited the lowest performance, whereas the 
two  transformer-like  models  demonstrated  better  performance,  with 
Volo-d1 achieving the highest performance.

Helpful Answer:

The table titled 'General transfer training hyper-parameters for each basic model' provides the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. These include ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7. The hyperparameters listed are Learning Rate, Minimum Learning Rate, Optimizer, Scheduler, Batch Size, Weight Decay, Input Size, and Epochs.

For instance, the Learning Rate for ResNet-50 is set to 1e-4, while it is 2e-3 for ViT-S/16, 1e-5 for Volo-d1, and also 1e-5 for ViP-Small/7. Similarly, the Optimizer for all these models is Adamw(0.9, 0.999), and the scheduler used is Cosine. The batch size for all models except ViP-Small/7 is 128, while it is 64 for ViP-Small/7. The weight decay for ResNet-50 is 5e-4, while it is 8e-6 for ViT-S/16, 4e-6 for Volo-d1, and 1e-8 for ViP-Small/7. All models use an input size of 224 x 224, and the epochs for all models are set to 210.
