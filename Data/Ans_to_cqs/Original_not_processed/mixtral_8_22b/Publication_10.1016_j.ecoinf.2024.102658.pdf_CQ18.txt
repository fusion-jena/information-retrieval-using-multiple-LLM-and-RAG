The  iterative  model  exploration  in  this  work  roughly  follows  the 
Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). The 
Bayesian and non-Bayesian model pairs are chosen so that one repre-
sents  a  less  flexible  model  in  terms  of  possible  shapes  of  its  decision 
boundary (Bayesian logistic regression and MLE logistic regression) and 
one  represents  a  more  flexible  model  (Bayesian  GAM  and  random 
forest).

Our process of finding the best model roughly follows the Bayesian 
workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). This is an 
iterative modeling process in which one systemically repeats the cycle of 
inspecting the outputs of a model, analyzing the effects of the model and 
its  configurations,  and  adjusting  the  configurations  or  switching  to 
another model type according to the observations. The cycle is repeated 
multiple times while recording the observations and results.

discrete points only at high latitudes, where the map projection exaggerates the 
inter-centroid distances.

4.2.1. Baseline model: random forest 

Random forest (Breiman, 2001) utilizes an ensemble of classification 
or regression trees; each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of the 
training dataset, and represents a series of sequential decisions, in which 
each node of the tree is a binary split made on a predictive feature (e.g., 
whether  the  mean  annual  temperature  is  above  25 
C).  Further,  a 
random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at 
each node (we use a value of sqrt(n), n being the number of potential 
predictors, for the size of this subset). When used for classification, the 
outputs from the component trees are put through a majority vote to 
create a single output. This is known to be a simple but powerful method 
of retaining the complex non-linearity of decision trees while avoiding 
overfitting.

Helpful Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the authors follow an iterative modeling process based on the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). In this process, they repeatedly inspect the outputs of a model, analyze the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjust the configurations or switch to another model type according to their observations. This cyclical approach allows them to systematically evaluate and improve the model performance throughout the training phase.
