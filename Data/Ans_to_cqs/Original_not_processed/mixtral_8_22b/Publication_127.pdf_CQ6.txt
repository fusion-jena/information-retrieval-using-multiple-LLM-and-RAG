An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the type of data being used. These steps help improve the quality of the input data and ensure that it is suitable for use in a deep learning algorithm. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

* Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of the input data so that they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others during training and improves convergence speed.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the magnitude of the input data to bring all features to a similar scale. This can be done using various methods such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or log transformation.
* Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, missing values, and other inconsistencies from the input data. This step ensures that only relevant information is fed into the deep learning model, improving its overall performance.
* Augmentation: Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc., to existing ones. This technique helps increase the size of the training set and reduces overfitting.
* Encoding: For categorical variables, encoding converts them into numerical form so that they can be processed by the deep learning algorithm. Common encoding techniques include label encoding, one-hot encoding, and binary encoding.
