number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

Birds play a vital role in ecosystems and provide various services to 
humans and the environment(Whelan et al., 2008). Birdsongs serve as a 
primary mode of communication for birds and contain a wealth of in-
formation. Birdsong classification can study the distribution, quantity, 
population  structures,  and  habitat  of  various  bird  species,  thereby 
assisting  in  protecting  ecosystem  diversity.  With  the  advancement  of 
computer vision, neural network architectures such as VGG(Simonyan 
and Zisserman, 2014), Inception(Szegedy et al., 2016), and ResNet(He 
et  al.,  2016)  have  been  proposed,  all  of  which  have  obtained  better 
accuracy  in  birdsong  classification.  For  instance,  Shazzadul  utilized 
VGG16 to extract features from bird images, followed by classification 
using  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM),  achieving  an  accuracy  of  89% 
(Islam et al., 2019). Sankupellay employed ResNet50 to autonomously

The parameters of each layer in the discriminator can be found in 
Table 3. The backbone network consists of four convolutional layers that 
extract features from images with a resolution of 256 × 256 × 3. These 
extracted features are then passed through two fully connected layers for 
further  processing.  Within  the  fully  connected  layers,  the  Sigmoid 
function is applied to one of them, facilitating the binary classification of 
true and false images. While the Softmax function is used in the other 
fully connected layer to predict the classification of the output results. 

Algorithm 1. The training algorithm of DR-ACGAN.

The low classification accuracy of the neural network caused by the 
lack of birdsong spectrogram data can be solved by data augmentation 
of ACGAN. In addition, we can improve the feature extraction capability 
of the network by increasing its depth. However, increasing the network 
depth  may  lead  to  overfitting  and  require  significant  computational 
resources.  Some  researchers  have  proposed  dynamic  convolution  to 
solve  those  problems,  using  a  set  of  K  parallel  convolution  kernels 
instead  of  a  single  convolution  kernel  per  layer.  These  parallel  con-
volutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention. The atten-
tion  dynamically  adjusts  the  weight  of  each  convolution  kernel 
according to the input, thus generating an adaptive dynamic convolu-
tion. Experiments results show that this structure achieved a 2.9% gain 
in the Imagenet classification task and an AP gain of 2.9 in CoCo Key-

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is designed for image classification tasks based on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mention of applying the Sigmoid and Softmax functions for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions the application of the model for birdsong classification, suggesting that the primary goal of the model is to classify different types of birds based on their songs or visual representations of their sounds.
