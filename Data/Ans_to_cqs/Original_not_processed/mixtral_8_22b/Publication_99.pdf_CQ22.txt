applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model. 

3.4. Performance evaluation

3.4. Performance evaluation 

Quantitative  evaluation  of  generative  models  is  still  a  challenging 
task due to the existence of many possible solutions (Black et al., 2020). 
Similar to recent studies, all reconstruction models were evaluated using 
Peak  Signal-To-Noise  Ratio  (PSNR)  and  Structural  Similarity  Index 
Measure (SSIM). 

3.4.1. Structural similarity index measure (SSIM)

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss. 

3.3.2. Pix2Pix network

Training GANs is challenging as both generator and discriminator are 
competing and hence expected to reach at equilibrium (Pan et al., 2019). 
In this study, all Pix2Pix models were trained for 50 epochs. After every 
500 iterations, the performance of the generator models were evaluated 
using  both  Structural  Similarity  Index  Measure  (SSIM)  and  the  Peak 
Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics and the model was saved as the 
best  model  if  it  has  improved  the  performance  on  the  validation  set 
compared to previous iterations.

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning models in this study is primarily evaluated using two quantitative measures: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are commonly used for evaluating generative models, which can be challenging due to the existence of multiple possible solutions.

For instance, the PConv networks are evaluated using these metrics after being trained for 50 epochs. Each training epoch involves saving the model as the best one based on its performance on the validation set, measured by validation loss. Similarly, the Pix2Pix networks are also assessed using PSNR and SSIM metrics after being trained for 50 epochs. However, their performance is checked every 500 iterations, and the model is saved as the best one if it improves upon the previous iterations' performance on the validation set.

On the other hand, classification networks use different metrics for performance evaluation. Given that our dataset is balanced, both networks are trained with a learning rate of 0.03 and cross-entropy loss as the loss function, optimized by the Adam optimizer. Although not explicitly mentioned, common metrics for evaluating classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
