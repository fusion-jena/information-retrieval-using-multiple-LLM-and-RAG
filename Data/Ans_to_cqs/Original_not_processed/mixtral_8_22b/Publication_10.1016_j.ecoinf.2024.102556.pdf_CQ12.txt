Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

Helpful Answer:
The text describes the use of a modified version of the Deep SORT algorithm, which incorporates a novel residual network structured with Res2Net modules and group convolution. This suggests that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the architecture includes several components such as Conv+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). These are all elements typically found in CNN architectures. Furthermore, the mention of convolutional kernels, feature extraction, and downsampling also points towards the use of CNNs. Therefore, we can conclude that the deep learning model employed in the described pipeline is predominantly based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
