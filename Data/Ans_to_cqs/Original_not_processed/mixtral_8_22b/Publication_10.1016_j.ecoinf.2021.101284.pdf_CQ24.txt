In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

5.1. The course of COVID-19 cases

The author of (Coro, 2020) introduced a means of establishing the 
◦
infection rate of COVID-19 globally at a 0.5
resolution via a Maximum 
Entropy  based  Ecological  Niche  Model  (ME-ENM).  This  model  was 
designed to identify geographical areas as a potential that is subject to a 
high infection rate. It indicated the locations that could contribute to the 
increase of the infection rate by virtue of their particular geophysical 
(surface  air  temperature,  precipitation,  and  elevation)  and  human- 
related  characteristics  (carbon  dioxide  and  population  density).  ME- 
ENM was trained on high infection rate data from 54 Italian provinces 
(up to the end of March 2020) and then tested using datasets from World 
country reports. The application of ME-ENM allowed for the determi-
nation of a risk index capable of identifying countries and regions having 
a  high  risk  of  disease  increase.  The  presented  results  implied  that  a

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific values for random seeds in the given context. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors such as weight initialization, shuffling training examples, dropout regularization, and other stochastic processes. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, researchers employ several techniques:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs. This helps maintain consistent behavior between different executions of the same program. In Python, this can be done using functions like `numpy.random.seed()` or `torch.manual_seed()`.

2. Deterministic Algorithms: Some algorithms have deterministic versions that do not rely on random number generation. For example, when sorting arrays, one can use a deterministic sorting algorithm instead of a randomized quicksort implementation.

3. Version Control: Keep track of all dependencies, libraries, and software versions used during development. This includes specifying exact version numbers in requirements files or environment configurations.

4. Documentation: Clearly document every step taken during the experiment, including hyperparameters, dataset splits, evaluation metrics, etc. This makes it easier to reproduce results and understand the impact of various design choices.

While these strategies help reduce variability caused by randomness, they may also limit the exploration of diverse solutions. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between controlling randomness and allowing enough variation to discover better models.
