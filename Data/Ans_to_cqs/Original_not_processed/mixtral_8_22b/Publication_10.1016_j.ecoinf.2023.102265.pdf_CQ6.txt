easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

We tested the performance of pre-trained ResNet-18/50/101 models 
by  training  each  with  the  same  500  honey  bee  images.  This  dataset 
contained 250 images of natural backgrounds and 250 anthropogenic 
backgrounds as determined by the manual algorithm. The training times 
for  all  three  models  were  similar,  with  ResNet-50  being  marginally 
faster. A pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model was therefore selected for 
our study, and the last layer before its classification layer was used to 
extract 1000 features for training our classifier model. These features are 
visualised in Fig. 7 using a t-SNE algorithm (Maaten et al., 2008). This is 
a  non-linear  dimensionality  reduction  method  for  visualising  high- 
dimensional data by providing each data-point a location in 2-D or 3- 
D space. In this case it shows that our two classes, natural and anthro-
pogenic microhabitats, are well structured (see Table 1).

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model was chosen for extracting features from the dataset containing 500 honey bee images. Before feeding these images into the pre-trained model, some common preprocessing techniques might have been applied, such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation. Image resizing ensures that all images have consistent dimensions, while normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, which helps stabilize the learning process. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping could also have been employed to increase the size of the dataset artificially and improve the model's robustness. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm the exact preprocessing steps performed in this particular scenario.
