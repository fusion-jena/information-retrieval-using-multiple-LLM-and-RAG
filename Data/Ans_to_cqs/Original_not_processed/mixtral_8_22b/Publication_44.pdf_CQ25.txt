Further-more, apart from ResNet-101, an Xception model can be used as a feature extractor while applying a depth-wise separable convolution to both ASPP and the decoder module, hence improving the speed and robustness of the encoder-decoder network.

Phase 2: Leaf Extraction Using Connected Component A classic connected component algorithm was first introduced by Azriel and John in 1966 [42]. Since then, numerous different implementations have been proposed for im-proving existing ones [43]. In image processing, connected components analysis helps to

kernel to expand without increasing the number of parameters [39]. This expansion of the
window is controlled by the dilation rate and it enables the network to capture information
from a larger receptive ﬁeld of view with the same parameters and computational complex-
ity as the normal convolution. The combination of spatial pyramid pooling with Atrous
convolutions resulted in an efﬁcient multi-scale processing module called Atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP). In the earlier version (DeepLabV3) [40], the last ResNet block of
the modiﬁed ResNet-101 uses different Atrous convolutions with different dilation rates.
ASPP, together with bilinear up sampling, is also used on top of the modiﬁed ResNet block.
DeepLabv3+ is an improvement in the previous version by adding an effective decoder
module to improve the boundaries of the segmentation results [41]. Furthermore, apart
from ResNet-101, an Xception model can be used as a feature extractor while applying a

feature map into a full-resolution segmentation map to provide a pixel-level classiﬁcation
that has the same size as an input image.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model discussed here is designed for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a specific class or category, such as 'tree','sky', or 'person'. It differs from object detection, which identifies objects within an image but does not necessarily label every single pixel.

In this case, the model is specifically used for leaf extraction using connected component algorithms. These algorithms help identify distinct regions or blobs in an image based on their connectivity. They are often used in image processing tasks like noise reduction, blob extraction, and object counting.

The model itself is a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), which is a type of architecture commonly used for semantic segmentation tasks. FCNs consist of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder part of the network is responsible for extracting potentially useful features from the input data. Once these features have been identified, they are passed to the decoder part of the network, which up-samples them back into a full-resolution segmentation map. This provides a pixel-level classification that matches the size of the original input image.

This particular model improves upon its predecessors by incorporating an effective decoder module, which enhances the accuracy of the segmentation results along object boundaries. Additionally, it utilizes either a modified ResNet-101 or an Xception model as a feature extractor, further refining the efficiency and performance of the overall network.
