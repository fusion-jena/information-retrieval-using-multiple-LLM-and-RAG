Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Various combinations of Pmean and Pstd values, along with typical
hyperparameters of neural networks such as learning rate, batch size,
and weight decay, were tested and explored. These values were assigned
using random generators to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of
the model's performance. The parameter ranges considered are as fol-
lows: learning rate = [0.00001, 0.001], batch size = [64, 8192], weight
decay = [0, 0.59], Pmean = [ (cid:0) 4, 1.8], and Pstd = [0.5, 1.68].

Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

parameters. The parameter values explored alongside the aforemen-
tioned autoencoder include the following: learning rates of 0.00005,
0.0005, 0.0001, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.01; batch sizes of 8, 16, 32, 64, and
128; weight decay values of 0, 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.001, with
dropout set to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25. For the focal loss parameters, α
was defined as the inverse of class frequency, 0.25, or 0.5, while γ was
set to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning models described in the given context use several hyperparameters during their training process. Some of these hyperparameters include:

1. Learning Rate: Various learning rates were tested, ranging from 0.00001 to 0.01. This includes specific values like 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1.

2. Batch Size: Different batch sizes were evaluated, including 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.

3. Latent Dimension: The latent dimension was also investigated, with values such as 128, 256, 512, and 2048 being mentioned.

4. Weight Decay: Weight decay values ranged from 0 to 0.59, with specific values like 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.00001 being used.

5. Optimizer: The Adam optimizer was employed during the training of the MLP.

6. Scheduler: A scheduler was utilized to adjust the learning rate when the network reached a plateau.

7. Regularization Techniques: Different regularization techniques were explored, including Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss.

8. Dropout: Dropout values of 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.25 were applied.

9. Additional Parameters: When using Focal Loss, additional parameters α and γ were introduced. The former served as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulated the impact of the scaling factor. Specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss was equivalent to Cross-Entropy Loss. Experiments included setting α as the inverse of class frequency, 0.25, or 0.5, while γ was set to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2.
