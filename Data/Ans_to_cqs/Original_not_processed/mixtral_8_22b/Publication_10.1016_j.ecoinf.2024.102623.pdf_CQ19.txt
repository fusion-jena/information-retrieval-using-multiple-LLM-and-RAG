vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

We aim to bridge this gap since the use of neural networks and deep 
learning  techniques  stands  as  a  promising  and  efficient  approach  for 
SDMs (Botella et al., 2023; Davis et al., 2023; Teng et al., 2023). These

We chose to use the benchmark dataset from Elith et al. (2020) due to 
its established reputation in SDMs and its inclusion of PA data to eval-
uate  models  trained  on  PO  data.  However,  the  tabular  format  of  this 
dataset typically reduces the performance of neural networks (Borisov 
et al., 2022; Grinsztajn et al., 2022). Our results align with this limita-
tion,  as  non-neural  network  approaches  demonstrated  comparable  or 
even  slightly  superior  performance  compared  to  our  method.  Never-
theless, certain studies suggest that deep learning-based SDMs can sur-
pass traditional machine learning methods by incorporating diverse data

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. It only mentions that the model uses an MLP architecture with four layers, each containing 512 neurons, and employs techniques such as batch normalization, ReLU activation function, sigmoid function, AdamW optimizer, and dropout. However, it does not specify whether these were implemented using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework.
