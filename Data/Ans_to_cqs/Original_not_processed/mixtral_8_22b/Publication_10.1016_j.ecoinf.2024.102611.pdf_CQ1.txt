Spinach classification, and columnar cactus recognition. Overall, deep 
learning models have shown great potential in plant leaf recognition and 
disease  detection,  and  their  application  can  contribute  to  improve 
agricultural  practices  and  crop  yield.  Table  1  Highlights  of  literature

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high-resolution images for classification tasks and the consideration of real-time field challenges during image acquisition. This suggests that image data collection could be one method employed in the process. Additionally, the mention of training models on benchmark datasets implies the use of publicly available datasets. Without further context, it cannot be determined if other methods such as surveys or sensor data were utilized.
