image presegmentation. This retains the benefits of object-based clas-
sification  while  eliminating  time-consuming  parameter  adjustments 
required by traditional segmentation methods. Furthermore, it is worth 
highlighting that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform. 
This indicates that it can be easily applied to other regions or different 
study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC 
classification tasks. In future studies, the sample and vegetation index 
feature datasets should be continuously optimised. Furthermore, we will 
incorporate CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into the study of 
LULC mapping in arid zones.

undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some aspects related to preparing data for machine learning models, particularly Random Forest (RF)-based Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping.

In the context, there is a discussion about addressing the issue of unbalanced training data using various sampling techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both. It also mentions a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model used to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping.

Additionally, the text highlights the use of image presegmentation, which helps retain the benefits of object-based classification while avoiding time-consuming parameter adjustments required by traditional segmentation methods. The proposed method is implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, allowing easy application to other regions or different study years.

While these points do not directly relate to preprocessing steps for deep learning models, they provide insights into how data preparation might look for certain applications. For instance, dealing with imbalanced classes and selecting appropriate features are common considerations when working with machine learning models.

As for general preprocessing steps often involved before training a deep learning model, these typically include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data from the dataset.
2. Normalization: Scaling numeric columns to a standard scale so that no feature dominates the others. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling and z-score normalization.
3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that contribute most to the prediction variable or outcome.
4. Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values using statistical measures or predictive models.
5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical form, e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding.
