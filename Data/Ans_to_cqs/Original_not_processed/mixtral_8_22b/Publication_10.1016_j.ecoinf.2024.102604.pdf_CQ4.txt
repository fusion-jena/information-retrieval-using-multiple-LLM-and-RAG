on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

accurately  reflect  the  efficacy  of  bias  correction  (Amaro  et  al.,  2023; 
Redding et al., 2017).

2.4.3. Model evaluation 

Two indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model 
in correcting the sampling bias. The area under the receiver operating

3.2.2. Relative evaluation 

Table 2 lists the percentages of positive cases for the relative eval-
uation metrics of each correction method, considering the different bias 
types and sample sizes. These percentages represented the cases where 
the corrected model outperformed the uncorrected model (ΔAUC >0 or 
ΔD > 0) under each experimental condition. The data suggest that when 
the sample size was limited to 70 or fewer, the aggregation background 
method tended to perform better, on average, than the other methods.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. It primarily focuses on discussing various aspects related to sampling biases, their corrections, and evaluations using certain models and metrics like AUC and D. However, it doesn't mention any specific details regarding data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
