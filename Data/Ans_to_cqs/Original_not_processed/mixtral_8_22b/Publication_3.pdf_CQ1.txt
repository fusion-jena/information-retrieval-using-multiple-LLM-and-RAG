Across broader taxonomic scales and phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Chan and Brown 
2017), other means (biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, classification, etc.) of restrict-
ing/limiting  candidate  species  pools  may  prove  useful  for  ‘fine-tuning’  of  TensorFlow’s 
automation of species recognition. Additional caveats for future consideration include (1) 
single notes per species and (2) sample sizes, which will be limited for rare species, those 
that occur at naturally low abundances, or taxa characterized by reduced detection proba-
bilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-lim-
ited  reproductive  cycles  (Wells  2010).  Avenues  for  future  development  of  these  methods 
in  our  immediate  plans  include  application  to  additional  taxonomic  groups  (e.g.,  insects, 
birds), and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor 
step to automated species identification.

Model architecture

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of DNNs that are specialized for image 
classification  tasks  and  pattern  recognition.  One  of  the  main  advantages  of  CNNs  is  the 
ability to perform automated feature extraction, eliminating the need for hand-crafted fea-
ture  extraction.  CNN  architecture  is  built  on  three  types  of  layers:  (1)  convolutional  lay-
ers,  which  are  the  most  important  because  they  apply  hierarchical  feature  extraction  and 
decomposition  of  input  images;  (2)  pooling  layers,  which  carry  out  operations  to  reduce 
numbers of parameters and necessary computation; and (3) fully connected layers, which 
perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline.

Results

We  calibrated  models  for  classification  challenges  using  different  numbers  of  training 
steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 
2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except 
Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given 
the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. 
The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows:

Challenge 1

We  created  a  confusion  matrix  to  depict  TensorFlow’s  initial  results  with  20  species 
(Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94.3%. We achieved 100% correct iden-
tification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were 
for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
According to the provided context, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through publicly available data from Cornell University’s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. This suggests that the researchers utilized existing datasets rather than conducting their own surveys or deploying sensors to collect new data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the method used for collecting raw data in this case is accessing and utilizing publicly available datasets.
