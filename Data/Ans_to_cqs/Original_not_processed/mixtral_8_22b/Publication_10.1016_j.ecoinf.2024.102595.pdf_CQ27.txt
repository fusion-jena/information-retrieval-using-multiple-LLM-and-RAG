Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that the model was tested using a separate test set, indicating that the model had already been deployed after being trained and validated. This suggests that standard procedures were likely followed for deploying the model, but without further details, we cannot confirm the exact steps taken.
