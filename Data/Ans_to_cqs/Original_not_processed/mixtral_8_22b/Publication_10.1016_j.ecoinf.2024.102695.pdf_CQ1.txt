4.3.1. Data description

This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

4.2. Experimental setup 

During the training phase, to accommodate multivariate input and 
univariate output, the input and output dimensions of the encoder and 
decoder  are set  to the  number of variables  in the  dataset. The model 
dimensionality  is  set  to  128  to  achieve  a  balance  between  model 
complexity  and  computational  efficiency.  Additionally,  the  model  in-
tegrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel in-
formation flows. The model architecture includes two layers of encoders 
and one layer of decoders, which help to comprehensively capture fea-
tures from time series data. To reduce the risk of overfitting, a dropout

During  training,  the  input  tensor  comprises  three  dimensions:  the 
batch  size,  the  number  of  model  variables,  and  the  future  prediction 
length. The dimension concerning the number of features is segmented 
by dynamically changing the slice sizes and strides, and the segmented 
tensors are folded, adding a slice dimension. Finally, by merging the first 

In the second stage of the attention calculation, the covariates are 
dynamically segmented, capturing their features at different time scales 
through multiscale attention. Specifically, for the static variables S(t),

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study involves analyzing multivariate marine chemical data, possibly collected through various means such as sensors or surveys. Furthermore, the mention of Hu et al.'s work on predicting river and stream water quality suggests that they might have employed similar data collection techniques. Similarly, Feng et al.'s use of wavelet threshold denoising implies that their data could have been gathered using sensors or other real-time monitoring devices. Lastly, Ikram et al.'s focus on estimating water temperatures indicates that they may have relied on sensor data or publicly available datasets. In conclusion, while the exact methods for gathering raw data remain undisclosed, it is plausible that the researchers utilized sensors, surveys, or public datasets to collect the necessary information for their respective studies.
