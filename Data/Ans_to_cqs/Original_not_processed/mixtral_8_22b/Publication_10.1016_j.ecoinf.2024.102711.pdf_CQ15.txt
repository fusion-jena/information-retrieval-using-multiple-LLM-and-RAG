2.5. Automated machine learning (AutoML) 

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed. 

2.5.1. AutoGluon

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  modelâ€™s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that optimal hyperparameter selection leads to improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They govern the training process and determine the overall behavior of the training algorithm. The text also mentions that k-fold cross-validation was chosen as the preferred approach for hyperparameter tuning. This technique involves dividing the development dataset into 'k' groups or folds. Each fold is then used once as a validation set while the remaining 'k - 1' folds form the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each of the 'k' folds used exactly once as the validation set. The error estimation is averaged over 'k' trials to produce a single estimation. This method is particularly useful when dealing with small datasets.
