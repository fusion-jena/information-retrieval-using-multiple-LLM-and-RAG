layers  of  the  DL  models  employed.  Specifically,  the 
feed-forward  regression  networks  in  [11,  26]  compress 
and  encode  images  into  smaller  representation  vectors, 
while the combination of CCNN and ResNeXt models in 
[11]  takes  an  input  image  of  size 72 × 72  and  produces 
an  output  density  map  of  size  18 × 18 .  To  overcome 
this  potential  information  loss,  the  UNet  model  was 
employed  as  the  learning  model  [24].  UNet  is  a  CNN 
architecture  originally  proposed  for  biomedical  image 
segmentation,  based  on  an  encoder–decoder-type  net-
work.  The  name  of  the  architecture  is  derived  from  its 
distinctive ‘U’ shape. The down-sampling/encoder block 
encodes the input images into feature representations at 
multiple  level,  capturing  the  context  information  from 
the  image. The  up-sampling/decoder  block  decodes  the 
feature  maps  learned  from  the  encoder.  The  symmet-

The  Model-K  architecture  is  a  regression  model  based 
on  VGG16  without  the  feature  extractor  on  top.  The 
output layer was flattened and given as input to 2 fully 
connected  (FC)  layers  with  linear  output.  The  regres-
sion  model  was  designed  to  predict  classwise  (five 
categories)  count.  To  compare  it  with  the  proposed 
solution,  we  modify  the  model  by  connecting  the  out-
put  layer  with  a  fully  connected  one  output  neuron. 
Model-K  was  initialized  with  pre-trained  Imagenet 
weights  and  then  trained  using  our  training  data  set 
with  a  Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  optimizer 
and  an  MSE  loss  function.  The  proposed  Model-2 
with  EfficientNet  feature  extractor  reached  an  RMSE 
value  of  1.88  and  0.60  for  the  SLL  and  elephants’  data 
sets,  respectively,  performing  better  than  the  Model-K 
with  an  RMSE  of  2.17  and  0.81  for  SSL  and  elephants’

a  high  dimensional  feature  vector1.  Then,  the  Decoder 
semantically projects the features learned by the encoder 
onto the pixel space, generating a corresponding density 
distribution for the given image. This density map is used 
to  get  the  number  of  objects  by  simply  integrating  the 
density distribution over the region (see “Counting from 
density map” section) (Fig. 1).

Data preparation

Both data sets were split into training and testing images 
with  a  ratio  of  80  :  20,  respectively.  For  the  SSLs’  data 
set,  the  first  800  images  were  used  for  training,  and  the 
remaining  148  were  used  as  test  images  to  evaluate  the 
model’s  performance.  For  the  elephants’  data  set,  1649 
images  were  used  for  training,  while  452  images  were 
used for testing.

EfficientNet-B5  feature  extractor  [27].  EfficientNet  is  a 
CNN  developed  by  Google,  characterized  by  high  accu-
racy  and  computational  efficiency.  Model-2  was  initial-
ized  by  pre-trained  weights  based  on  the  Imagenet  data 
set  [28].  All  the  parameters  were  optimized  using  the 
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

Training

An  Nvidia  GeForce  RTX  2060  GPU  was  used  for  train-
ing,  with  a  batch  size  of  8.  Model-1  (without  feature 
extractor)  was  trained  for  7  h  and  Model-2  (with  a  fea-
ture  extractor)  for  17  h.  Based  on  the  model’s  perfor-
mance on the validation set, the early stopping technique 
was  applied  to  avoid  over-fitting.  Model-2,  which  used 

pre-trained  weights  and  thus  some  prior  relevant  infor-
mation, converged faster than Model-1 (Fig. 3).

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the description of the UNet model being employed as the learning model, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for semantic segmentation or object detection tasks. The UNet model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture initially proposed for biomedical image segmentation, which suggests that the model might be utilized for similar purposes in this case. Additionally, the mention of the 'U' shape of the architecture indicates that the model could also be used for object detection tasks, where the encoder-decoder structure helps capture spatial relationships between different parts of the input image.
