Helpful Answer:
The given context does not directly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some aspects related to processing and handling remote sensing data, particularly from Sentinel-2 satellites.

One relevant point mentioned in the context is the use of atmospheric corrections, specifically the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method. This technique helps reduce atmospheric effects on the acquired images, which could potentially introduce biases if left uncorrected. Although this is not explicitly addressing data bias in terms of class imbalance or representation, it still contributes to improving the overall quality and reliability of the input data.

Additionally, the context mentions combining different types of data within a model-assisted framework or hierarchical modeling. These approaches might help mitigate potential biases by incorporating additional information sources and accounting for their relationships when building models. Nonetheless, these methods do not directly target data bias reduction strategies like stratification, oversampling, or undersampling.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, there is no explicit discussion about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The focus seems to be more on general data processing and integration rather than tackling specific issues related to data bias.
