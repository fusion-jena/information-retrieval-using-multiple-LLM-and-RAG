on  data  collection,  feature  extraction,  and  parameter  estimation  by 
applying two major ground-based systems, stationary TLS and mobile 
laser scanning (MLS), including PLS (Bienert et al., 2021; Gollob et al., 
2020a, 2020b; Tockner et al., 2022).

split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

The  TLS  data  were  collected  using  a  RIEGL  VZ-400i  (Riegl  Laser 
Measurement Systems GmbH, 2022a) with an additional Nikon D850 
DSLR camera and an attached Nikon AF 14 mm f/2.8 D ED fisheye lens 
to gather spectral information. In contrast to the PLS, the TLS scanner 
must be set up on a tripod at several positions to capture stands from 
different angles. The TLS was set up on a tripod, and the DSLR camera 
was fastened to the top of the scanner (Fig. 2 (b)). When a single scan 
was completed, the recording was saved using the operator interface on 
the device and the TLS unit was carried to the next scan position. To scan 
the entire stand (all three subareas were scanned without considering 
their borders), the TLS System was placed at 107 positions to ensure the 
complete coverage of all marked trees. The collection of the TLS data 
took 4.5 h.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in these studies. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) based solely on this information. It would require further research or access to more detailed documentation related to each study to find out about their respective code repositories.
