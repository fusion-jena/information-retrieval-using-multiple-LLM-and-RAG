Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This is one of the most commonly used methods for object detection tasks. It involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images and labeling them accordingly.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike bounding box annotation which only outlines the general area of an object, instance segmentation provides pixel-level accuracy by marking the exact boundaries of each object instance.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This method involves assigning labels to every pixel in an image according to the class they belong to. It is often used for scene understanding tasks where identifying individual instances might not be necessary but understanding the overall layout of the scene is important.

4. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding box annotation, polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects. But instead of simple rectangles, more complex polygons can be drawn to better fit irregularly shaped objects.

5. Key Point Annotation: Also known as landmark annotation, key point annotation involves placing dots on specific parts of an object. This technique is frequently used in facial recognition systems where points are placed on features like eyes, nose, mouth etc.

6. Image Classification: Here, entire images are labeled rather than individual objects within them. This technique is useful for categorizing images into broad categories.
