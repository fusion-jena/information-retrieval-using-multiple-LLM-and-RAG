details)).  We  loaded  the  training  datasets  in  R,  using  the  “sp”  vector 
package, then allocated 80% of the data as test files and the remaining 
20% as validation files using the createDataPartition () function from the 
“caret”  package. The test datasets enabled us to check  optimal model 
parameters  and  initial  model  performance  based  on  repeated  cross- 
validation,  while  the  validation  dataset  enabled  us  to  check  final 
model accuracy (Qian et al., 2015).

2.3.2.4. RF: random forest classification. With the RF approach, we used 
the “randomForest” package. We allowed the model to set the number of 
trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) by default so as 
to ensure satisfactory model performance (Duro et al., 2012; Matlhodi 
et al., 2019; Zhang and Roy, 2017). i.e. about 500 decision trees were 
created  by  the  model  under  default  settings,  with  over  3000  training 
samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings.

2.3.3. Estimating classification accuracy

and  Kappas,  2017).  The  kNN  model  is  a  non-parametric  model  that 
performs  LULC  classification  based  on  the  distance  between  k  closest 
samples drawn from training datasets. The approach depends on thor-
ough image (predictor) pre-processing so as to reduce sampling bias and 
ensure equal treatment of predictors when computing distance (Kuhn 
and Johnson, 2016). The SVM model uses support vectors (i.e. based on 
a subset of training data points closest to decision boundaries) to locate 
optimal decision boundaries that separate two LULC classes (Cortes and 
Vapnik, 1995; Kuhn and Johnson, 2016). The ANN model is a mathe-
matical model developed as an analogy of the human brain. Using an 
interconnected  group  of  responsive  and  conducting  nodes,  the  ANN 
model  mimics,  in  a  very  simplified  fashion,  the  functionality  of  the 
human brain for knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis and problem

Using the remaining 80% test data alongside the image subset for the 
study  area,  we  applied  four  image  classification  models  (kNN,  SVM, 
ANN and RF) to classify the test data by applying the train() function 
from the “caret” package. In order to clarify what we used as training 
vectors for all four classification approaches, we used the names of the 
eight  LULC  classes  identified  (croplands,  dense  forest,  grassland 
savanna,  open  savanna/barelands,  built-up  areas,  water  bodies,  wet-
lands,  and  woody  savanna)  as  target  variable  values.  For  predictor 
variables, we used the six Landsat image bands mentioned in Section 
2.2.  as  predictors  for  our  analysis.  Before  training  each  model,  we 
defined a set of model tuning parameters using the trainControl() func-
tion of the “caret” package. Each modeling algorithm had at least one 
tuning  parameter  that  controlled  model  performance,  and  the  train-

Helpful Answer:
The authors used 80% of their data as test files and the remaining 20% as validation files. They used the 'createDataPartition()' function from the 'caret' package in R to allocate this data. The test datasets were used to check optimal model parameters and initial model performance based on repeated cross-validation. On the other hand, the validation dataset was used to check the final model accuracy.
