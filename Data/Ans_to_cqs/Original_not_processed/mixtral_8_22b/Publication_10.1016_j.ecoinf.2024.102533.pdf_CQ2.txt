Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Therefore, the data normalization stage is unnecessary.

value of fish is rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 indicates the best 
freshness quality, and1 denotes the worst. For instance, the best fresh-
ness  quality of the  eye is  characterized by convexity, clear  and shiny 
cornea and pupil, specific for fish species. The lowest quality is char-
acterized  by  a  very  concave  appearance,  a  very  cloudy  cornea,  gray 
pupils, and a lack of shine. The examination process involves observing 
the eyes, clear observation of the removed gills, confirming body mucus 
by touching the skin surface, dissecting the body to observe the meat, 
inhaling gases emitted by the body of the fish, and touching the meat 
surface to assess its texture (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). Fish that have undergone

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the data format might include images or CSV files. For example, Arora et al. (2022) discuss a low-cost imaging framework for freshness evaluation from multifocal fish tissues, suggesting that images could be one of the data formats used. Additionally, since the paper mentions that data will be made available upon request, it implies that the data could potentially be in a structured format such as CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
