5.2.2. Training

7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights.

7.1.4. Low power neural networks in hardware 

It is desirable to reduce the power consumption of the DynAIkonTrap 
to make deployment in remote locations easier and less expensive. An 
implementation by Si et al. (2020) of a Multilayer Perceptron model on 
an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) was shown to run in a similar 
time frame to a software-based approach, but at a clock speed lower by a 
factor of 144. The authors portray this as the ability to achieve a lower 
power consumption or improve performance by a factor of 144. Results 
published by Intel (2016) indicate a Convolutional Neural Network can 
be  run  on  an  FPGA  with  twice  the  efficiency  of  a  software/CPU 
implementation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly state the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that further research is required to identify and automate a process that, given a set of species of interest, outputs a robust and reliable neural network model with suitable weights. This suggests that the researchers are still working on developing a methodology for deploying their customized neural networks. Additionally, the text discusses the desire to reduce power consumption using low-power neural networks implemented in hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This implies that the researchers might be considering hardware platforms for deploying their models. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the deployment process, I cannot provide a detailed answer.
