18. Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) - In order to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (that are usually 
1–2 pixels in size), the minimum size of a mine for this step of the model was deemed as 3 pixels in size (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image). It is a 
common occurrence in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale, to contain isolated, misclassified individual pixels. Therefore, 
only mines above 2700 m2 were selected, removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies to ensure the 
most accurate result could be achieved.

their data-fusion reclassification approach was applied. Using CART on 
the  GEE  platform,  Lobo  et  al.  (2018)  reported  an  accuracy  of  74.5% 
(80% producer accuracy, 69% user accuracy).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling within their respective deep learning pipelines. However, it can be assumed that some form of data augmentation may have been used due to its common application in improving the performance of machine learning models. Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization by creating new training examples through various transformations applied to existing images. Without explicit mention of these techniques in the given sources, one cannot definitively state which methods were employed.
