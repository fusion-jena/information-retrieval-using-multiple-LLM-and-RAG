features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

CNN has different architectures, such as Le-Net, Alex-Net, Res-Net, 
CapsuleNet, High-Resolution Networks, etc. (Kattenborn et al., 2021). 
This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep 
CNNs  proposed  by  Krizhevsky  et  al.  (2012),  applied  successfully  in 
image scene classification tasks (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021d). 
AlexNet's  triumph  is  attributed  to  practical  strategies  like  ReLU 
nonlinear  layers  and  dropout  regularization  techniques,  making  it 
effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent 
for handling complex problems (Han et al., 2017). Compared to other 
CNN models (e.g., VGG and ResNet), the AlexNet model has a simpler 
structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train 
and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex 
problems (Pu et al., 2019).
