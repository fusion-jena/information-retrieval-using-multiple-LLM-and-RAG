Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

1.10),  an  open  source  ML  library  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019).  We  used  a 
ResNet-34  model  with  pre-trained  weights  for  the  CNN  architecture. 
ResNet models typically achieve high-performance in image and audio 
recognition tasks (Bergler et al., 2022; He et al., 2016; Stowell et al., 
2019) and have been widely applied for automated wildlife image and 
call recognition (Kahl et al., 2021; Sankupellay and Konovalov, 2018; 
Stowell,  2022).  Our  training  dataset  was  imbalanced,  with  a  lower 
number of audio frames containing a SBTF call than no-SBTF call. We 
followed the recommendations of Buda et al. (2018) and oversampled 
the SBTF audio frames with the WeightedRandomSampler function in 
Pytorch.  We  used  an  Adam  optimiser  algorithm  with  an  exponential 
learning rate decay function, which is a common method of learning rate 
optimisation  used  for  CNN  training  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014).  We then

Helpful Answer:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used in the pipeline. This can be seen from the text where it mentions "We used a ResNet-34 model with pre-trained weights for the CNN architecture." Additionally, the figure caption also refers to this as a CNN model.
