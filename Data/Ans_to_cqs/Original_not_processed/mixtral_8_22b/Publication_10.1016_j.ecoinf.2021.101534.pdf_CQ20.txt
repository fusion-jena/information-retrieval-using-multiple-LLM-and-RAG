whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2. 

3.4.2. Model inference and test datasets

Since collecting and preparing a big training dataset on wildlife sounds 
is  time-  and  labor-consuming,  the  lack  of  data  for  training  a  high- 
performance  CNN-based  classifier  is  the  major  challenge  for  devel-
oping an autonomous wildlife sound identifier (Marcus, 2018).

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Helpful Answer:

The model training was performed using a workstation equipped with the following specifications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe SSD * 2. This indicates that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs.
