Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve model performance by introducing variations into the training set.

Based on the context, we can infer that the study may have involved some form of data preprocessing or manipulation, such as using occurrence records of species and repeating distinct rounds of software and methods of clipping. However, without explicit mention of data augmentation techniques, we cannot confirm which ones were used in this particular case.
