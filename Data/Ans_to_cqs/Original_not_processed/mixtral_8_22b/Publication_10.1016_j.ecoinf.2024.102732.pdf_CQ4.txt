scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

regularization makes it highly effective for complex predictive modeling
tasks (Hengl et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021c; Luo et al., 2024; Mehmood
et al., 2024a; Strandberg and Låås, 2019). SVR is a regression technique
that uses kernel functions to map input data into higher-dimensional
spaces where a hyperplane is fitted to minimize prediction error. This
method is particularly effective for capturing nonlinear relationships in
data. SVR balances model complexity and empirical risk, making it
suitable for a wide range of regression applications (Lee et al., 2020;
Mehmood et al., 2024a; Sharifi et al., 2016).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, generally speaking, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing images. These techniques can include flipping (horizontal or vertical), rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, translating, and adding noise. Each transformation helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained models.
