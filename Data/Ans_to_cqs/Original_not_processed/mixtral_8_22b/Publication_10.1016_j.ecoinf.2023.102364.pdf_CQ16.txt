2.3. Machine learning ensembles

Put Fig. 2 app here: a) 50 survey location data (black dots) for Short- 
billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015. b) 50 
survey location data (presence = purple dots, absence = green dots) for 
Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015. 
These surveys are the model training data. 

Put Fig. 3: app here:a) U.S. Census blocks (in red) as well as 80 survey 
location  data  (black  dots;  presence/absence  surveys)  for  Short-billed 
Gulls (Larus canus) during May 2013. b) Presence (pink dots)/absence 
(green dots) for 80 survey location for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) 
during May 2013. These point data serve as the external model assess-
ment data.

2.3. Machine learning ensembles 

We  used  the  combined  2014–2015  Short-billed  Gull  presence/ 
absence data cube to train an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models 
in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3 (Formula 1). We used several 
established and leading ML algorithms (Hegel et al., 2010; Fern´andez- 
Delgado et al., 2014 for overview) and combined them in an averaged 
ensemble to obtain the best-possible prediction and overall synergy from 
each algorithm best as possible (sensu J. Friedman ‘many weak learners 
make for a strong learner’; Friedman, 2002, Hastie et al., 2009. See also 
Hardy et al., 2011, Fox et al., 2017 and Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2022 
for applications). That approach will overcome stand-alone approaches 
such  as  linear  regression,  which  do  not  offer  unique  solutions,  e.g. 
Ascombe’s Quartet, and have difficulty to meet all required parametric 
assumptions (McArdle, 1988). The specific algorithms and their settings 
are described below.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some potential criteria could include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss over time, or meeting other user-specified conditions. In this case, the authors mention using an ensemble of machine learning models trained with the combined 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence data cube, but they do not specify the exact stopping criterion used for each individual model. Therefore, it cannot be determined definitively what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
