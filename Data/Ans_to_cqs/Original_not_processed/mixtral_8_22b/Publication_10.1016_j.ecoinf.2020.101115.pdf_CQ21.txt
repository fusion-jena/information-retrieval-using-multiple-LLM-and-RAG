the procedures involved in storing, uploading metadata, and imaging
samples, a high-level process flow was developed (Fig. 3). The process
flow outlines where the sample metadata is generated, analysed, and
eventually stored. Furthermore, it documents how the physical samples
and digital data are linked. This cross-disciplinary process flow is novel
because it outlines how the operational part (routine sampling of fish
for government mandated stock assessment) of an organization (the
MI), and the research capacity of an organization (imaging and reading
growth on scales and otoliths), can be interlinked. Additionally, the
management of the IFBA dataset follows the procedures and roles
outlined within the MI's Data Management Quality Framework
(Leadbetter et al., 2019).

%Query
Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained models and gain insights into their predictions.
