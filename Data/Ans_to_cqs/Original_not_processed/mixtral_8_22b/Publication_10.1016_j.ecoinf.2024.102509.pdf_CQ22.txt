predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

Helpful Answer:
The table presented in the given context provides information about the performance evaluation of different prediction models, including a deep learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The metrics used to evaluate these models include Adjusted R^2 (Adjusted Coefficient of Determination), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These metrics help assess the goodness of fit, prediction errors, and complexity of the models. However, it is important to note that the specific metrics used for evaluating deep learning models may vary depending on the task and application. For example, in classification tasks, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, while in regression tasks, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R^2 are commonly used.
