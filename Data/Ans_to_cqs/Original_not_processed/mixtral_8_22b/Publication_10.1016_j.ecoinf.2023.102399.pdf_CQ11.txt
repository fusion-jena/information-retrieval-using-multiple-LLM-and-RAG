Fig. 4. The manual measurement of total length (yellow double-headed arrows), height (red double-headed arrows), and body weight (For interpretation of the 
references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 

The precise dimensions of the object can be determined by rotating the 
minimum bounding rectangle and aligning it with the scale bar (Fig. 4 b 
and c) in the image. 

2.3. Fish image collection method 

The YOLOv5 model has been categorized into five versions based on 
varying  sizes,  training  speeds,  inference  speeds  and  model  accuracy, 
which were model n, s, m, l and x, respectively. The real-time detection 
of  free-swimming  orthogonal  fish  bodies  requires  high  performance, 
making model version n the most appropriate for this research project, 
with the fastest speed and smallest parameters.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, considering the authors are affiliated with reputable institutions such as China Agricultural University and their work was published in Ecological Informatics, it would be reasonable to assume that they followed proper scientific protocols and made their dataset publicly accessible through a reliable data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. To find the specific link, one could search these repositories using keywords from the paper title, author names, or other relevant details. Alternatively, contacting the corresponding author directly might also yield the desired information.
