An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

ingful outputs. In Fig. 15a, we apply a window with a size corresponding 
to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-
tations (Fig. 15c &  15d). In Fig. 15c, the separated hyphae have been

Following the methodology described in Section 2.5.1, we computed 
the  average  precision,  recall,  F1-measure,  and  MMC  for  the  three 
different sets of fungal images. Results are shown in Table 2. In all cases, 
the 2nd-order Gaussian filter was applied with the set of angles θ having a 
◦
step  size  of  15
.  The  datasets  contained  diverse  organisms  and  were 
acquired with diverse resolutions. Therefore, the standard deviation σ 
and  the  minimum  branch  length  were  varied.  In  the  image  set  from 
(Cardini et al., 2020), all images were acquired at the same scale and 
represented the same organism. Therefore, the σ and minimum branch 
length  parameters  were  the  same  for  all  images  (i.e.,  σ = 4  pixels  or 
4.4μm and minimum branch length = 22 μm.). For the image set from 
(Vidal-Diez  de  Ulzurrun  et  al.,  2019),  the  image  scales  vary  between 
samples, and the σ-parameter was varied (σ = [2.5, 3.5] pixels, step size

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general approaches to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. It should also be noted that the use of large amounts of training data can help mitigate the effects of randomness in model initialization and parameter updates during optimization.
