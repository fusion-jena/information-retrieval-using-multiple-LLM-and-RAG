Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

Therefore, the data normalization stage is unnecessary.

2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm.

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automate the process of fish grading or determining the level of freshness of various fish species. This is achieved by applying machine learning techniques to a dataset containing six organoleptic parameters collected from seven different fish species over eleven days. These parameters serve as the basis for automatically classifying the freshness levels of the fish. The specific type of deep learning task being performed here appears to be classification, as the goal is to assign each instance in the dataset to one of several predefined categories or classes representing varying degrees of freshness. However, it should be noted that while the text does mention the use of deep learning, it primarily focuses on describing the application of clustering methods for automatic freshness classification. Therefore, further clarification would be needed to definitively state whether the deep learning model specifically performs the classification task or if traditional machine learning algorithms are also involved in this process.
