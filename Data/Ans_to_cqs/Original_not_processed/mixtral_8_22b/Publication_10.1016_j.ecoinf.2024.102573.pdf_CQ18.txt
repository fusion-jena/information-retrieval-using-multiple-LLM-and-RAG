A good evaluation strategy without temporal information is to use 
the whole recording. It requires windowing the lengthy recordings due 
to limited machine memory. Hence, each test recording was split into

3.1. Main results 

Table 2 shows the test results. The largest performance gap between 
the learnable and traditional frontends stems from using PCEN instead 
of log compression. When combined with PCEN, the (mel-)spectrogram 
is on par with the learnable frontends. Noticeably, a proper normaliza-
tion on top of the log compression produced similar results to the PCEN 
version of the models. It is hard to eyeball some of these effects, espe-
cially for the data augmentation. Therefore, a performance summary for 
the 48 models is depicted in Fig. 3 to comprehend the importance of 
each component. Fig. 4 shows the confusion matrices of the base and the 
best configuration for each frontend.

The above randomness is undesired for the evaluation. Thus, the first 
five  seconds  of  the  validation  recordings  were  used  to  monitor  the 
models during training. It works since the labeled species are usually 
present during the first few seconds of the recordings from Xeno-Canto. 
The preliminary experiments confirmed that this strategy significantly 
reduces the computation time while producing valid results compared to 
the full-length evaluation used for the test set.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the first five seconds of the validation recordings were used. This strategy was effective because the labeled species are typically present during the initial few seconds of the recordings from Xeno-Canto. Preliminary experiments confirmed that this approach significantly reduces computation time while still yielding valid results when compared to the full-length evaluation employed for the test set.
