vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, considering the common practices in machine learning projects, some possible postprocessing steps could include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to assess the performance of the model. In this case, the Mean AUC performance is calculated for different alternative ML loss functions, which can be considered part of the model evaluation process.

2. Visualizations: Creating visual representations like saliency maps or heatmaps can help understand how the model makes its predictions by highlighting important features or regions in the input data. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, these techniques might have been employed during the development phase.

3. Confusion matrices: These are often used to evaluate the performance of a classifier by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. While it is not directly stated in the context, confusion matrices may have been utilized to analyze the results further.

In summary, while the exact postprocessing steps are not specified in the provided context, based on standard practices in machine learning projects, they likely included evaluating the model using various metrics, possibly creating visualizations, and potentially analyzing confusion matrices.
