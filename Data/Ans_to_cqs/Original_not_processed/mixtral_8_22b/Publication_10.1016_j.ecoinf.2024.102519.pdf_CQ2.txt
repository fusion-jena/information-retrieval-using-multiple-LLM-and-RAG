Helpful Answer:
The study by X. Wu et al. uses various types of data sources with different spatial resolutions. The datasets include DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, meteorological data, vector data, and statistical data. These datasets can be categorized into three main data formats: raster, vector, and statistical. Raster data is a grid-based format where each cell represents a specific value or category. In this case, DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, and meteorological data are all presented in raster format. Vector data, on the other hand, consists of points, lines, and polygons representing geographical features. This study includes vector data but does not specify its content. Lastly, statistical data refers to numerical information collected through surveys or experiments, which in this case is obtained from Statistical Yearbooks. However, it should be noted that the study does not explicitly mention using any form of image, audio, or video data in their deep learning pipeline.
