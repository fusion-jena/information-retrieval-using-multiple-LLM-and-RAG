5. Discussion 

Agroforestry is a crucial segment of integrated agriculture and forest 
land use that supports high carbon sequestration and maintains regu-
lating services in the region (Chen et al., 2015). However, the current 
study analysed AGB estimation based on field data and predicted using 
remotely sensed optical and SAR datasets and their derived indices using 
machine learning models such as RF, ANN, and SVM. Most of the esti-
mated AGB in the Belpada block was within the range below 30 Mg/ha, 
suggesting relatively recent plantations. For instance, Rizvi et al. (2011) 
estimated the AGB in poplar (Populus deltoides)-based agroforestry sys-
tems in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Yamunanagar, and Haryana. They 
found that AGB ranged between 27 and 32 Mg/ha in plantations and 
between 66 and 83 Mg/ha in agri-silviculture areas. Swamy and Puri

Accurate estimation of AGB in agroforestry systems is crucial for the 
effective management and evaluation of their ecosystem services. Pre-
cise AGB estimation poses a challenge owing to the intricate vegetation 
structure and species variability in such systems. Therefore, this study 
aims to develop an AGB estimation and mapping approach specifically 
for  agroforestry  systems,  employing  a  combined  use  of  multisensor 
remote sensing and field inventory data and utilising machine learning 
algorithms  (SVM,  RF,  and  ANN)  to  construct  predictive  AGB  models. 
This  study  provides  a  synergistic  approach  for  optimising  carbon 
sequestration  estimation  in  agroforestry  ecosystems  in  sub-tropical

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not mention any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the application of remote sensing and machine learning algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in agroforestry systems. To find out where the code repository is located, one would need additional information or resources beyond what has been given here.
