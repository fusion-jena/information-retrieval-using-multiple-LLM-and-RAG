%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were employed based solely on this context.

The context primarily focuses on authorship contributions and roles within a research project related to various topics, including resources, supervision, validation, investigation, data curation, and more. Additionally, there are references to several sources regarding orchids, medicinal plants, and geographical studies, but none of these directly address the topic of data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines.
