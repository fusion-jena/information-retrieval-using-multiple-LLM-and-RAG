displayed in Fig. 2. The presented PTDLEN-VAE model includes a series 
of operations such as pre-processing, EfficientNet based feature extrac-
tion, IKHO based parameter optimization, and VAE based classification. 
Once  the  contrast  level  of  the  input  satellite  images  is  improved,  the 
features  are  extracted  by  the  EfficientNet  model,  and  the  hyper-
parameter of the EfficientNet model is optimally adjusted by the IKHO 
algorithm.  Finally,  the  VAE  based  classification  model  is  executed  to 
assign the proper class labels to the satellite images.

This  section  offers  a  brief  experimental  results  analysis  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. Table 1 and Fig. 6 assess 
the  classification  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  model  with 
other techniques on the applied UCM dataset. On examining the results

PTDLEN-VAE model has accomplished maximum average precision of 
96% whereas the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques 
have  gained  a  minimum  average  precision  of  95.70%,  95.68%,  and 
95.49% respectively. Followed by, on investigative the outcomes with

Stochastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  on  BP  is  managing  stochastic 
input,  then  not  stochastic  unit  within  the  networks.  The  solution  is 
named as “reparameterization trick”, which is to transfer the sampling 
to input layer. It is easy from N(μ(x), θ(x)) by sampling ∈ ~ N(0, I), af-
terward calculating pmodelz = μ(x) + θ1/2(x) * e. Where μ(x) and θ(x) are 
the mean and covariance of (z| x). So, Eq. (13) is calculated as:

In VAE is comprised of input layer, various AEs, and output layer. 
Then, an unsupervised pre-training step, the supervised fine-tuning step 
is implemented for learning the entire network parameters by employ-
ing the BP technique. This technique is comprised of 1 input layer, 5 
hidden layers, and 1 output layer. 

4. Performance validation

VAE initially draw an instance z from the code distribution pmodel(z). The 
sample is executed via a differentiable generator network g(z). Lastly, x 
undergo sampling from a distribution Pmodel(x; g(z)) = pmodel(x| z). At the 
time of training process, the estimated inference network (or encoder) q 
(z| x)  can  be  employed  for  obtaining  z  and  Pmodel  (x| z)  is  afterward 
considered  as  the  decoder  network  (Dai  et  al.,  2019).  The  main 
perception of VAE is that it can be trained using the maximization of the 
variational lower bound L(q) related to the data point x:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on the general machine learning workflow and the mentioned components in the text.

After training the PTDLEN-VAE model, one potential postprocessing step could involve evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 6. These metrics help measure the quality of the model's predictions and compare them against other techniques.

Additionally, creating confusion matrices might also be useful for understanding the model's performance across different classes or categories. Confusion matrices display true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values, providing insights into where the model performs well and where it struggles.

Since the model uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for classification, another possible postprocessing step could include visualizing saliency maps. Saliency maps highlight important features or regions in the input image that contribute most significantly to the model's decision-making process. By generating these maps, researchers can gain better insight into how the model makes its predictions and identify any biases or weaknesses in the model.

Overall, while the given context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps, common practices in machine learning suggest that evaluating model performance using metrics, confusion matrices, and possibly saliency maps would be beneficial for analyzing the PTDLEN-VAE model.
