A search space of the primary hyperparameters was defined. Opti-
mization  algorithms  were executed to  find  the  highest  accuracy from 
1,788,160  hyperparameter  combinations.  Our  model  was  trained  for 
200 epochs for each trial to find three DNN architectures that were used 
to  build  three  models  and  train  them  for  the  entire  dataset  for  1000 
epochs (Table 2).

adjustable parameters that control network architecture, optimization 
procedure,  and  regularization.  Common  hyperparameters  include 
number of layers and nodes, learning rate, dropout rate, etc. However, 
optimizing  model hyperparameters  remains imperative  for leveraging

Determining  the  optimal  DNN  architecture  is  an  active  area  of 
research. Recent studies have evaluated different techniques for tuning 
hyperparameters, such as network structure, activation functions, reg-
ularization,  and  optimization  algorithms  (Xu  and  Liang,  2021).  For 
instance,  Lecun  et  al.  (1998)  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  sto-
chastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  for  DNN  training.  Though it  has  been 
shown  to  get  stuck  in  local  minima,  momentum  was  shown  to  help 
overcome  this  by  accelerating  SGD  convergence  (Luo  et  al.,  2021). 
Dropout  regularization  has  also proven  essential  for  controlling  over-
fitting  as  network  depth  and  complexity  increase  (Gupta  and  Raza, 
2020). More recently, exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions 
have  gained  some  traction  for  addressing  ReLU  limitations  like  dead 
neurons  and  slow  convergence  (Alkhouly  et  al.,  2021;  Clevert  et  al.,

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, based on the available context, we cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model.
