train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the use of a few-shot learning method involving two-way one-shot learning for training a Siamese network. It also mentions the evaluation of animal tracking and provides several references related to deep learning applications in ecological studies. However, without explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it is impossible to determine which ones were employed.
