similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

3.2. Cataloging overview 

The  description  below  assumes  that  the  acoustic  waveforms  have 
been  sampled  (or  re-sampled)  at  a  rate  of  24  kHz,  demeaned,  and 
pressure  corrected.  The  approach  utilizes  a  multi-stage  workflow. 
Candidate signals are identified by matching a suite of harmonic kernels 
using spectrogram cross-correlation (modified after Ricci et al., 2017a). 
Machine learning is then used to mitigate the false alarm rate associated 
with  the  detection  stage  (e.g.,  Balantic  and  Donovan,  2020;  Bohnen-
stiehl, 2023a). Frequency-reassigned spectrogram images are generated

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. In this case, the text mentions two specific methods: a score-to-posterior-probability transformation function and a confusion matrix.

Firstly, a score-to-posterior-probability transformation function is defined using a 10-fold cross-validation. This function provides a way to estimate the posterior probability for new observations based on their scores from the classifier model. By applying this function, it becomes possible to convert the output scores of the model into probabilities, making them more interpretable and useful for decision-making purposes.

Secondly, a confusion matrix is presented for the test data not seen during training. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes. In this case, the confusion matrix helps assess the accuracy of the classifier model by comparing its predictions against the true labels of the test data.

These postprocessing steps provide valuable insights into the performance of the classifier model and help ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data. Other common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps to highlight important features contributing to the model's decisions or calculating various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to further evaluate the model's performance. However, these additional methods are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
