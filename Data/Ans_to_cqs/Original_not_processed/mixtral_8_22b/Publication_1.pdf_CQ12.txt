analysts.  Second,  using  machine  learning  (ML)  techniques,  such 
as  deep  learning  (DL),  we  progressively  train  computational 
models  to  detect  and  classify  events  of  interest,  and  reduce  the 
amount of wildlife data reviewed by human analysts by orders of 
magnitude.

However,  the  rise  of  cheap  and  powerful  sensors  has  created  an 
ever-increasing data glut.  To be effective, these new tools must be 
coupled  with  new  automated  approaches  to  processing  and 
analyzing wildlife data streams. 

Here we describe examples of how we are leveraging advances in 
the areas of big data and deep learning to help researchers extract 
meaningful  information  from  the  torrent  of  new  sensor  data,  and 
improve the adaptive management of natural systems.

all  based  on  the  lower  level  representations  learned  in  previous

in a supervised fashion, such that the learning algorithm (usually

each input data sample.

development  is  shifting  from  programs  hand-written  by  domain 
experts, to training machines by examples â€“ often millions of data 
points  in  the  case  of  difficult  problems  such  as  unconstrained 
image recognition [32]. The major enablers for the success of DL 
have  been  the  availability  of  large  amounts  of  data,  and  the 
corresponding  computational  infrastructure  required  by  the 
learning  algorithms.  In  comparison  to  other  ML  algorithms,  the 
performance of a DL algorithm scales very well with the number 
of  training  examples  and  the  amount  of  compute  cycles  can  be 
applied. 

The biodiversity monitoring application that we have outlined is a 
prime candidate for application of DL, due to availability of large 
amounts  of  labeled  data  produced  by  the  analysts  using  our  UI.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning techniques are being employed to process and analyze wildlife data streams, but it does not specify whether they use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or any other type of deep learning architecture. Therefore, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in their pipeline based solely on this context.
