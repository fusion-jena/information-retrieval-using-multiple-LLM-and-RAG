Dataset Our dataset consisted of 35 573 images for each of the
12 channels covering 35 species and resulting in a total of 426
876 images. This dataset was split into three sets for training, val-
idation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. All images
were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle. In order to gain
a more robust and better generalising classiﬁer, the images in the

database for training of deep learning models. Comparable stud-
ies used 1060 (Daood et al., 2016), 13 617 images (Pedersen
et al., 2017) or 19 500 images (Sevillano et al., 2020), while in
our study the CNN classiﬁer was trained with 426 876 images.

We have previously suggested that a minimum of 200 images
per species are required for accurate species identiﬁcation of phy-
toplankton (Dunker et al., 2018). By contrast, in the present
study on pollen, ﬁve out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen
grains were classiﬁed with an accuracy higher than 90%. Based
on these ﬁndings, we concluded that between 50 and 100 pollen
grains represented a reasonable amount of pollen images on a sin-
gle channel to be included in the reference library.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species and resulting in a total of 426,876 images. These images were then center cropped to an equally sized rectangle. Additionally, the images in the training set were augmented through various techniques such as flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data collection involved capturing multispectral images of pollen grains from different plant species using some form of imaging technology. However, the specifics of this process, including whether it involved surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not mentioned in the given context.
