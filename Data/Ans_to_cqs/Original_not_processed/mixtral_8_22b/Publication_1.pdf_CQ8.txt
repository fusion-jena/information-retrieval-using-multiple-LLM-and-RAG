However,  the  rise  of  cheap  and  powerful  sensors  has  created  an 
ever-increasing data glut.  To be effective, these new tools must be 
coupled  with  new  automated  approaches  to  processing  and 
analyzing wildlife data streams. 

Here we describe examples of how we are leveraging advances in 
the areas of big data and deep learning to help researchers extract 
meaningful  information  from  the  torrent  of  new  sensor  data,  and 
improve the adaptive management of natural systems.

BIODIVERSITY  
4.1.Big data infrastructure

!
 
The specific subfield of ML that we have invested in is known as 
Deep  Learning  (DL)  [31].  DL  is  a  quickly  growing  and  vibrant 
field;  here  we  summarize  our  use  of  DL  and  postulate  how 
biodiversity monitoring can be improved using various properties 
of DL algorithms.

Our deep learning approach has allowed us to scale projects by an 
order  of  magnitude  while  maintaining  costs.  For  example,  the 
technique allowed one client to grow the scale of a key project by 
two  orders  of  magnitude  from  600  hours  of  monitoring  in  the 
summer  of  2012  to  almost  80,000  hours  of  monitoring  in  the 
summer of 2014.  This effort has transformed their understanding 
of  wildlife  impacts,  and  doubled  the  funding  for  mitigation  and 
monitoring efforts in the area. 

As  the  field  develops,  we  expect  that  landscape  scale  automated 
sensor  networks  will  provide  real-time  data  for  assessing  the 
health  of  natural  communities,  and  measuring  the  success  or 
shortcomings  of  conservation  efforts,  allowing  data  to  drive 
iterative improvements in the field.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given piece of context. The paper only discusses the application of deep learning techniques for large scale biodiversity monitoring but does not provide any details about the implementation or availability of the code used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
