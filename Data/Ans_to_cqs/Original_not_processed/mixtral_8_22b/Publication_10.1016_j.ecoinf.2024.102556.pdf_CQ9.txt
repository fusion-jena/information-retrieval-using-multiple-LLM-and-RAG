map and reduces the matching accuracy. 

To strike a balance between the strengths and weaknesses of shallow 
and deep networks, MSF fusion techniques were employed for feature- 
extraction  from  Procapra  przewalskii  in  the  target  detection  frames. 
Currently,  common  MSF  fusion  methods  include  the  FPN  (Lin  et  al., 
2017) and BiFPN (Tan et al., 2020), which rely on fusing features with 
varying resolutions within a layer structure. Although they enhance the 
network’s  capability  for  MSF  extraction,  they  introduce  additional 
complexity to the network structure.

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, without further details, it is impossible to determine where the data repository might be located, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other platform.
