2.1.1. Soil separates 

A prevalent method for classifying soil types is the utilization of the 
USDA  soil  texture  classification  system  (García-Gaines  and  Franken-
stein, 2015). This ternary system enables the determination of one of the 
12 textural classes by inputting the proportions of the three primary soil 
particle groups, known as “soil separates”: sand, silt, and clay (Fig. 1). 
Previous studies have demonstrated a diverse array of applications 
for this ternary diagram, including the representation of hydraulic in-
formation (Groenendyk et al., 2015) and subsurface soil properties (Hu 
et al., 2004), the collection of agricultural data for dynamic soil texture 
prediction (Aarthi and Sivakumar, 2020), and the assessment of sensor

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, generally speaking, there are several common approaches to splitting datasets for machine learning tasks, including deep learning models. These include:

1. Random sampling: Data is randomly divided into different subsets, typically with a larger portion allocated for training (e.g., 70%) and smaller portions for testing (e.g., 15%) and validation (e.g., 15%). The randomness ensures that each subset has similar statistical characteristics.

2. Stratified sampling: Similar to random sampling but takes into account the distribution of target variables or classes within the dataset. It aims to maintain the same proportion of classes in all subsets. This can be particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

3. Time-series cross-validation: When working with sequential data such as time series, it is important to preserve temporal dependencies during the splitting process. One popular technique is rolling origin evaluation, where the initial training set grows over time while the size of the test set remains constant.

4. K-fold cross-validation: The dataset is divided into k equal folds, and the model is trained and tested k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. This helps reduce bias and variance in performance estimates.

In summary, the choice of splitting strategy depends on factors like the nature of the problem, the type of data available, and the desired tradeoff between bias and variance in model evaluations.
