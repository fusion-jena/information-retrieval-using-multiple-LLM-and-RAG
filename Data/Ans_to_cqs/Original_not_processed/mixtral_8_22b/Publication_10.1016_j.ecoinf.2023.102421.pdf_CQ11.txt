predictive efficiency, handle large datasets, and reduce training time. It 
is typically recommended for tabular datasets. LightGBM differs from 
other tree-based methods by implementing leaf-wise splits that create 
more  complex  trees,  which  are  more  efficient  in  reducing  loss  and 
resulting  in  higher  accuracy.  The  split  is  based  on  a  novel  sampling 
method named Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (Ke et al., 2017), in 
which data with small gradients are excluded, and the rest are used for

information  gain  estimation  and  tree  growth.  This  algorithm  is 
controlled by several parameter groups, including (1) Boosting param-
eters such as Max_depth, Learning_rate, and gamma, and (2) Learning 
task  parameters  such  as  loss  function  type,  evaluation  metric,  and 
number of iterations. As a result, the model becomes more complex as 
the tree grows, but more loss is reduced than level-wise, and the algo-
rithm learns faster.
