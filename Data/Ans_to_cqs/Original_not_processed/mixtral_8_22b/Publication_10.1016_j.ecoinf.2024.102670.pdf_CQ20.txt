An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-
tations (Fig. 15c &  15d). In Fig. 15c, the separated hyphae have been

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models.

The context discusses various aspects related to deep learning methods, such as the difficulty in obtaining sufficient ground truth data, using crowd-sourcing for manual annotations, developing a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model, and comparing its performance against other methods. However, there is no mention of any specific hardware resources used for training these deep learning models.
