In tropical regions, grasslands are mostly concentrated at the edges 
of forests and cultivated land (Li et al., 2022). Soil resource degradation 
in  grasslands  must  be  considered  within 
forest-
–grassland–cultivated  land  ecosystem;  (Salazar  et  al.,  2015).  In  com-
parison to forest and cultivated land, grassland is a more fragile natural 
ecosystem due to the lack of energy inflow; therefore, it is at greater risk 
of  ecological  degradation  (Chang  et  al.,  2022).  In  this  study,  when 
combined with the findings of Wu et al. (2022), DEM was identified as 
the  most  important  influence  on  vegetation  degradation  and  soil 
degradation in grasslands. The DEM, especially when paired with LDR 
and VPOP, was associated with increased degradation of vegetation and 
soil in grasslands (Wu et al., 2022). The construction of roads and res-
idential areas will significantly increase anthropogenic interference with

This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.
