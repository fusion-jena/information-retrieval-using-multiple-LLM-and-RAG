Access to the Pl@ntNet classiﬁcation tool is provided through a dedicated
API available at my.plantnet.org. The main feature of this API is a RESTful
JSON-based web service that can accept one to ﬁve images of a plant and re-
turns a list of likely species. The species are associated with classiﬁcation
scores (the softmax output of the CNN), as well as a list of matching images
retrieved from the database. To facilitate the implementation of future studies
based on the methodology of this paper, we have developed the ‘‘plantnet’’51
R-package allowing users to query the Pl@ntNet API. The package is available
online at https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet.

Once data are generated by AI natural-
ists we must consider how they are
shared to ensure recognition of their au-
thors, observation traceability, and long-
term accessibility. We suggest following
the TDWG standards,43 such as Darwin-
Core among others, to ensure the data
are interoperable with other biodiversity datasets and can be
shared via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org). Metadata accompa-
nying these datasets should include the AI model architecture,
technical speciﬁcities of the AI model training phase, digital ob-
ject identiﬁer of the dataset used to train it, AI model version,
classiﬁcation score of each image, date, location, photograph
name, and image license. Classiﬁcation score, which provides
a mathematical value of the conﬁdence in the prediction of a
model for a speciﬁc image, is particularly important as it can
be used in subsequent analyses to ﬁlter the data by the level
of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation accuracy. A researcher will

the Pl@ntNet user community (currently 1.8 million user accounts). At the time
of writing, the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with
batch normalization.50 The network is pre-trained on the commonly used Im-
ageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers
30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images. The taxonomic
coverage of our study is therefore one to three orders of magnitude larger
than previously published studies making use of automated species identiﬁca-
tion for ecological research. The training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobi-
lization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep,
distributed, and large-scale learning. Thus, the resulting classiﬁcation tool is in
itself a major advance in biodiversity data science.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Pl@ntNet classification tool is accessible through a dedicated API available at <https://my.plantnet.org>. Additionally, the authors suggest following the TDWG standards, including Darwin Core, to share data via the GBIF portal (<http://www.gbif.org>). They also mention that the trained models require high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning. Given these details, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning pipeline might be hosted on a private or institutional server rather than being publicly available on a platform like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. Nevertheless, without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
