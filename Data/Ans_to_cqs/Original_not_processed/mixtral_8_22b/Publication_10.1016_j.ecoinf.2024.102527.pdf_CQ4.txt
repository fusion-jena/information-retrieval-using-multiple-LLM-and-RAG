respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information. 

3. Results 

3.1. Experiment results of transfer strategy optimization

When it comes to selecting update layers, we recommend selectively 
updating the last few layers of the DCNN model to enhance its perfor-
mance in empty image recognition. This approach can lead to a signif-
icant  improvement  in  the  model’s  performance,  as  opposed  to  solely 
updating  the  fully  connected  layer.  Specifically,  when  using  a  model 
from  the  ResNext  or  ResNet  family  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  as  the 
source model, we recommend using TLS_4 as the transfer strategy. In 
contexts where pronounced discrepancies exist between the target and 
source  domain  datasets,  it  could  prove  advantageous  to  augment  the 
number of convolutional layers subject to update. For example, in the 
case  of  ResNext  series  models,  using  TLS_3  can  further  enhance  the 
performance of the transfer model.

We  used  the  ResNext-101  model  to  systematically  study  transfer 
learning techniques. This model combines the advantages of the ResNet 
and InceptionV3 models, which are widely used for the empty image 
recognition task. Our proposed optimal update layer schemes based on 
the ResNext-101 model can be applied to any member of the ResNext 
family  (i.e.,  ResNext-X,  where  X  = 18,  34,  50,  101,  152,  etc.).  We 
speculate that these schemes are also suitable for models of the ResNet 
family (i.e., ResNet-X, where X = 18, 34, 50, 101, 152, etc.), but further 
validation is still needed in practical projects.

2.2.3. Data splitting 

Based on the conceptual model mentioned above, we split the data to 
construct  the  source  and  target  domain  datasets  to  carry  out  transfer 
learning experiments.  For the  ImageNet  dataset, we directly  used the 
pre-trained model on ImageNet-1 k as the source model, so there was no 
need to split the dataset. Both the SS and the LSM dataset are camera 
trap  image  datasets.  Each  time  the  camera  is  triggered,  it  captures 
multiple images in succession, called a capture event. A capture event 
frequently  comprises  three  images.  Notably,  images  within  the  same 
event are significantly similar to each other. Splitting the images in an 
event into training and test sets may lead to poor generalization of the 
DCNN  model. To  prevent  this, we kept  the integrity  of events  during 
data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., that have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that increasing the number of convolutional layers subject to update might be beneficial in cases where significant differences exist between the target and source domain datasets. This statement suggests that some form of data augmentation might have been considered while designing the deep learning pipeline, although the exact methods remain unclear from the provided context.
