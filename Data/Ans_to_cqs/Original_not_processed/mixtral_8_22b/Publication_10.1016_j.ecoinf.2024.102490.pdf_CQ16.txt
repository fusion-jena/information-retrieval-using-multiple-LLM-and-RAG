For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that 80% of the data was used as the training set, while the remaining 20% was used as the evaluation set to assess model performance. This suggests that the evaluation set might have been used to monitor the progress of the training process and decide when to stop training. Common criteria for stopping training include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or achieving a desired level of performance on the validation set. Without more specific details from the text, it cannot be determined which exact criterion was used in this case.
