the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data.

4. Discussion 

Deep learning is a rising tool for ecologists, covering a wide range of 
topics (Christin et al., 2019), such as the identification of animal species 
(Norouzzadeh et al., 2021) or the estimation of biodiversity in large data 
sets  (James  and  Bradshaw,  2020).  Among  the  current  applications  of 
deep learning techniques in ecology, identification and classification of 
individuals based on photographs have been proposed as a useful tool

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several clues suggesting that the authors use image data. For instance, they discuss the limitation of having a small number of labeled images in each category, indicating that their dataset likely contains images. Furthermore, they refer to the application of deep learning methods in identifying animal species based on photographs, implying that their model uses visual input. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be inferred that the authors employ image data in their deep learning pipeline.
