poration of prior knowledge, which  is crucial when exploring contin-
uous parameters. Following the random search, we utilize GridSearchCV 
to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  in  the  vicinity  of  the  best  hyper-
parameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evalu-
ates  every  possible  combination  within  a  predefined  grid  of 
hyperparameter  values,  guaranteeing  that  the  optimal  parameter

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

combination within the grid is identified and ensuring search precision. 
This  deterministic  approach  is  invaluable  when  the  hyperparameter 
space is relatively more constrained and well-defined, and exhaustive 
exploration is computationally feasible. The rationale behind applying 
this hierarchical approach is to amalgamate the benefits of both methods 
to  achieve  an  optimal  balance  between  computational  efficiency  and 
search precision (Table 2). The model exhibits exemplary performance 
by utilizing a dataset composed of 235 predictors and 5000 data points 
randomly split into 3000 for training and 2000 for validation (a 60/40 
ratio).  Precisely,  it  attains  a  flawless  training  accuracy  of  1.0.  Mean-
while, the model demonstrates a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the 
validation dataset. Furthermore, upon optimizing the hyperparameters 
of the RF model, we meticulously evaluated the model’s performance

WSM. At the heart of SHAP is the Shapley values, which are calculated as 
follows: For each feature of features, we compare the prediction with 
and without the feature of interest, averaging over all possible subsets. 
For a prediction model f, the SHAP value for feature i in a particular 
instance x is calculated as: 

Φi(f, x) =

|S|(cid:0) 1)!

S⊆F\{i}

|F|!

[fx(S ∪ {i} ) (cid:0)

where Φi  is the SHAP value for feature i, F is the set of all features, S is a 
subset of features excluding i, fx(S) is the prediction of the model f when 
only the features in set S are utilized. The term

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using two predominant models - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. Initially, RandomizedSearchCV is used to perform a broad exploration of the hyperparameter space. This method offers a computational advantage by evaluating only a user-specified subset of hyperparameter combinations. It is beneficial when there is uncertainty about the optimal values or when dealing with large hyperparameter spaces. After this initial exploration, GridSearchCV is employed to conduct an exhaustive search around the best hyperparameters found by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV guarantees that the optimal parameter combination within the grid is identified, making it valuable when the hyperparameter space is relatively smaller and well-defined. By combining these two methods, an optimal balance between computational efficiency and search precision can be achieved.
