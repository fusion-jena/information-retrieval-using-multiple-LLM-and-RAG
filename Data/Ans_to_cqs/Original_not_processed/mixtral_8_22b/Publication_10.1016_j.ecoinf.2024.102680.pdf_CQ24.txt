regulation. We set the batch size of all networks to 16 uniformly.

Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

the  feature  information,  leaving  the  other  half  unprocessed.  The  un-
processed half is directly concatenated with the post-processed features.

Input 

The input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations on the 
initial images. Preprocessing operations include resizing the images to 
the  required  size  and  applying  algorithms  such  as  mosaic  data 
augmentation. These preprocessing steps make the distribution of the 
input  data  more  uniform  and  enhance  the  ability  of  the  model  to 
represent  the  data,  thereby improving  the  model  performance  during 
training.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a specific random seed value. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.

However, some common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility by initializing the same weights and biases each time the code runs. Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones wherever possible. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can be used to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. But again, without further context or information, it is impossible to determine if any of these strategies were employed in the development of the UODN network.
