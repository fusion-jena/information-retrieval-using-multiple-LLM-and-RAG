our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

collected at three field sites: Pelican Moun-
tain  (PM),  Calling  Lake  (CL)  and  Conklin 
(CK). Manual classification of fuel types used 
in  semantic  segmentation  training  and 
testing were limited to data collected at PM 
and  CL.  Field  measurement  data  and  raw 
photos  from  the  CK  field  site  were  used 
solely for independent validation. R refers to

our current task. This base network has been trained on a subset of the 
COCO train2017 dataset (Lin et al., 2015), consisting of a few thousand 
images,  using  the  20  categories  present  in  the  Pascal  VOC  dataset 
(Everingham et al., 2010). The transfer learning methodology used in 
our work is shown in Fig. 4. Our deep convolutional neural network uses 
the convolution layers of the Deeplabv3-Resnet101 network as a learned 
feature extractor. We then attached a classification head of 2048 neu-
rons  with  sigmoid  activation.  Therefore,  each  pixel  was  assigned  10 
scores in the range of 0 to 1, for the 10 classes, and the class with the 
highest score was declared as the predicted class for that pixel. We used 
the cross-entropy loss as the objective function for training our network, 
and  the  Adam  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014)  optimizer  for  updating  the 
trainable parameters.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. This information can be found in the last paragraph of the given text, where it states, "We used the cross-entropy loss as the objective function for training our network, and the Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) optimizer for updating the trainable parameters."
