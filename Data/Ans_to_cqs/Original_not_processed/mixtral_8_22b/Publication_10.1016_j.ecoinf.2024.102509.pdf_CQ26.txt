the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, which involves dividing the data into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has approximately equal representation from all classes. Oversampling is another technique where synthetic samples are created from minority class examples to balance the dataset. Undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to achieve balanced datasets. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data to reduce bias. These techniques help mitigate data imbalance issues and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine if these techniques were employed in this study. It only mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. Additionally, it states that the accuracy of the ANN's training process depends on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset.
