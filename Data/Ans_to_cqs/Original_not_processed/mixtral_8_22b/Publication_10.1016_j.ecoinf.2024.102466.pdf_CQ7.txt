their performance in complex, real-world ecological settings. In recent 
years, deep learning-based approaches, such as YOLO (Redmon et al., 
2016) (one-stage) and Faster RCNN (two-stage) (Ren et al., 2015), have 
been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in object detection 
tasks.  Two-stage  and  one-stage  object  detection  are  two  popular  ap-
proaches for detecting objects in images (Fig. 2).

5. Conclusion 

In this study, we proposed a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 
wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China’s Northeast Tiger 
and Leopard National Park. Based on this dataset, we employed 8 deep 
learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their per-
formance.  Our  results  indicate  that  deep  learning-based  approaches 
have the potential to detect wild birds in camera traps efficiently. By 
applying  these  approaches,  manual  processing  costs  can  be  reduced, 
enabling  more  efficient  monitoring  of  wildlife  populations  over  wide 
areas and over time. Our findings can help conservation practitioners 
choose  appropriate  models  for  their  detection  tasks,  as  well  as  offer 
insight  on  the  use  of  deep  learning-based  technologies  to  improve 
wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.

Ortmann and Johnson, 2021). Secondly, dataset noise is another factor 
that  affects  the  algorithm’s  performance  in  identifying  specific  bird 
species.  This  noise  can  arise  for  a  number  of  reasons,  for  example, 
vandalism, animal damage, loss of power or extreme weather. According 
to Foster (2008), we believe that it is common and may be difficult to 
avoid. In complex environments, environmental clutter and ambiguities 
may affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. These 
conditions  make  it  difficult  for  the  algorithm  to  accurately  learn  the 
features of a particular bird species during training, thus affecting its 
detection and recognition capabilities.

Helpful Answer: The table titled 'Table 3' provides information about the number of images used for training and validation purposes. However, there isn't any explicit mention of how the data was divided into training, testing, and validation sets. Typically, datasets are randomly partitioned into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It appears that in this case, the authors only explicitly mentioned using a training set and a validation set, with 7773 images being used for training and 1943 images being used for validation. There is no clear indication of whether a separate test set was also utilized.
