2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

diction  of  the  deep  learning  model.  This  dataset  was  taken  to  verify 
whether our proposed approach can handle that issue. The dataset was 
shared  by  Jiang  et  al.  (2020)  through  the  Github  repository:

4.1.1. Traditional vs patch-based pipeline 

In the traditional approach, the results indicate that the deep models 
cannot handle the issues with the dataset. For the DeepWeeds dataset, 
DenseNet169 and DenseNet201 models achieved the highest accuracy, 
but the prediction result was affected by inter-class similarity and intra- 
class  dissimilarity  problems.  Fig.  6  shows  a  confusion  matrix  of  the 
DenseNet201 model on the DeepWeeds dataset. It can be seen that the 
misclassification rate for chinee apple and snake weed are very  high. 
Since, there are lot of similarity in the morphology of those two weed 
species,  it  become  challenging  for  the  model  to  distinguish  them  by 
comparing the features of some part of an image. Besides, many weed 
images were classified as non-weed, and some native plants were rec-
ognised as prickly acacia or snake weeds.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general practices in machine learning, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before starting any process involving randomness. This ensures reproducibility of experiments and consistency across different runs. Another strategy could involve employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce the impact of randomness on the final results. These methods help in obtaining more robust estimates of model performance by averaging over multiple trials with different subsets of the data.
