of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

into four classes with different susceptibility classes, namely low, me-
dium,  high,  and  extreme,  using  Jenks'  natural  break  classification 
method  in  ArcGIS  10.6.  The  Jenks  Natural  Breaks  categorization  (or 
optimization) system is a data categorization methodology that aims to 
maximize  the  organization  of  a  given  set  of  values  into  distinct  and 
meaningful classes. A natural class refers to the class range considered 
the  most  ideal  and  is  observed  to  occur  “naturally”  within  a  given 
dataset. A class interval consists of elements exhibiting comparable at-
tributes, constituting an inherent grouping within a given dataset. The 
approach  employed  in  this  study  is  to  minimize  the  variance  within 
classes  while  simultaneously  maximizing  the  variance  across  types

forests  using  564  fire  ignition  points  and  ten  different  variables.  The 
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (AUC = 0.894) demonstrated the 
best performance, and NDVI was among the variables analyzed. Corre-
lation analysis of forest fire ignition points and variables showed that the 
NDVI (r = 0.51) index was the most reliable predictor of fire occurrence. 
In contrast, Iban  and  Sekertekin (2022) developed  a fire  risk map 
using  seven  machine  learning  techniques,  RS  data,  and  GIS.  Thirteen 
different variables affecting forest fire risk were employed in this study. 
The accuracy of the maps obtained using seven machine-learning tech-
niques ranged from 0.817 to 0.879, as measured by AUC values. NDVI 
was  among  the  variables  used  in  this  study.  The  correlation  analysis 
showed that the elevation variable (r = 0.626) had the highest corre-
lation with fire risk, while NDVI (r = 0.256) exhibited a low correlation.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the input data. These steps help improve the quality of the data and ensure better performance of the model. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It ensures that only relevant and accurate information is fed into the model.

2. Normalization/Standardization: In many cases, it is necessary to scale the input features so they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This process helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their larger magnitudes, which could negatively impact the model's performance. Common methods for normalization include Min-Max Scaling and Z-score Standardization.

3. Feature Selection/Extraction: Selecting or extracting the most important features from the dataset can significantly reduce computational complexity and improve model performance. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or manual feature selection based on domain knowledge can be applied.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, synthetic samples can be generated through transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc. This technique is especially useful when working with limited datasets.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models require numerical inputs, so categorical variables need to be converted into numeric form. One popular encoding method is one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a binary vector.

These preprocessing steps should be carefully chosen and tailored according to the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Properly preprocessed data will lead to improved model performance and generalizability.
