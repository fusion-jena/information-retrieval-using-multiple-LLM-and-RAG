2.3.1. EfficientNet 

The first model selected is EfficientNet-B7, which is a Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) with efficient scaling factors (Tan and Le, 2019). 
To elaborate, all CNNs are a cascade of convolutional layers that can 
scale  the  input  imageâ€™s  resolution  (width  and  height)  and  channel 
(number  of  color  channels).  CNN  architectures  can  also  scale  by  the 
number of consecutive convolutional layers (depth).

We collected the FishInTurbidWater dataset and quickly and weakly 
labeled  it  to  contribute  to  the  first  weakly-supervised  fish  dataset  in 
turbid  waters.  We,  then  used  this  dataset  to  develop  two  novel  deep 
learning networks, one using semi-supervised contrastive learning for 
significantly  accelerated  model  deployment  time,  and  one  weakly- 
supervised  model  to  shorten  deployment  time,  while  providing  high 
accuracy. 

For  semi-supervised  contrastive  learning,  we  first  trained  a  self- 
supervised  contrastive  learning  model  and  then  fine-tuned  it  on  our

4. Discussions 

The  development  of  deep  learning  methodologies  continues  to 
advance at an astonishing rate and be applied to various applications 
ranging from biomedical (Azghadi et al., 2020), hydrological processes 
in river channels (Talukdar et al., 2023) and agricultural (Olsen et al., 
2019) systems, to marine (Laradji et al., 2021; Saleh et al., 2022b), and 
environmental (Jahanbakht et al., 2022a) sciences. The application of 
deep learning technologies has been also used in profiling the ecosystem 
services of estuarine habitats by community members (Yee et al., 2023). 
In this paper, we extend the application of deep learning methodologies 
to advance state-of-the-art underwater fish video processing techniques 
applied to turbid waters.

weakly  labeled  dataset.  This  semi-,  weakly-supervised  approach  re-
quires only a small portion of our weakly labeled dataset, which makes 
the  development  cycle  from  data  labeling  to  final  model  inferencing 
very fast (i.e., 4 h) while producing a relatively high accuracy of 89%. 
For  the  ensembling  approach,  we  first  trained  two  state-of-the-art 
DNNs on ImageNet. We then performed transfer learning of these two 
DNNs  on  our  weakly  labeled  dataset.  This  generated  two  weakly- 
supervised  DNNs,  which  we  ensembled using  the  XGBoost  technique. 
This novel ensemble technique significantly improves the overall accu-
racy compared to the two weakly-supervised individual DNNs.

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically EfficientNet-B7. This model was chosen due to its efficient scaling factors, making it suitable for handling images with varying resolutions and channels. The use of CNNs allows for the cascading of convolutional layers, enabling the network to process complex visual information effectively. In this case, the CNN was employed for both semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly supervised modeling, contributing to the development of advanced underwater fish video processing techniques for turbid waters.
