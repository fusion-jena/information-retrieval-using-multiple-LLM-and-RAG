%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer based on the available information. It would be necessary to have more details or access to additional resources to determine the specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
