In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

The Apriori algorithm consists of a sequence of steps for identifying 
the most frequent itemset in a given database (Fig. 2). Two main pro-
cesses  are  performed  iteratively  to  locate  the  most  frequent  itemsets: 
joining and pruning. As the name indicates, join represents the union of 
itemsets,  and  pruning  is  a  data  compression  technique  in  machine 
learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by 
removing  sections  of  the  tree  that  are  non-critical  and  redundant  to 
classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier 
and  improves  the  predictive  accuracy  by  reducing  overfitting  (Zhao 
et al., 2009).

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, based on general practices in data mining and machine learning, these preprocessing steps are often necessary to prepare the data for analysis. Normalization involves rescaling numeric features to a common range to prevent differences in scales from influencing the outcome. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to have approximately mean zero and variance one, which can improve the performance of some models. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, and other issues that may affect the quality of the data. These preprocessing steps are typically carried out after selecting relevant data for the study and before applying data mining techniques like the Apriori algorithm mentioned in the context.
