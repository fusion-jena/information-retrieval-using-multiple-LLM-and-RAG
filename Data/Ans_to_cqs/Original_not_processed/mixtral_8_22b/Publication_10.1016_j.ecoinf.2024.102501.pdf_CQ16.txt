forecasting nitrate decomposition in blast furnaces, proving its utility in 
environmental  management  and  industrial  pollution  control.  These 
diverse  applications  underscore  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  method's  adapt-

The bold values in Table 6 represent the best evaluation results for 
each algorithm. For these five algorithms, the third input combination, 
that is, Tem, Ec, Tur, and H, was selected as prediction inputs, achieving 
the highest R2 as well as the lowest MSE and MAE in both the training 
and  validation  phases.  Thus,  it  can  be  inferred  that  these  four  moni-
toring variables  all contribute positively to the prediction of DO con-
centration. In addition, the results in Table 6 show that compared with 
the  single  SVR model, the  MSE  and MAE of  the WTD-SVR model are 
reduced  by  8.33%  and  0.14%,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  SVR

3.1. Data and test environment 

In this experiment, the data from the first eight days were used as the 
training set, and the data from the last two days were used as the vali-
dation set. The four water quality parameters, Ec, Tem, Tur, and H, were 
used as inputs of the model to predict the DO concentration after 10 min. 
The test environment consisted of an Intel I5–5200U processor with 
CPU clock speed of 2.2 GHz and memory of 8 GB. The operating system 
was Windows 10 (64-bit). The programming language was Python 3.7 
(64-bit), and the integrated development environment was Anaconda 3, 
with Anaconda's sklearn package used for support vector regression and 
PyWavelets used for the wavelet transform.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when they reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures optimal performance on unseen data. In this case, the authors use a separate dataset for validation, which suggests they might have employed similar techniques to decide when to stop training their models.
