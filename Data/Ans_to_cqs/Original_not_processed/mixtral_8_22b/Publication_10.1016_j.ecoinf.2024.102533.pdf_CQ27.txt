2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm. 

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results

we utilize 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness 
clusters for each species.
