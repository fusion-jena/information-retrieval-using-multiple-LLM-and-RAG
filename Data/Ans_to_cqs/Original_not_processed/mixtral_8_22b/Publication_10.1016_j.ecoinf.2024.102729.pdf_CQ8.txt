Commonly used correlation analysis methods, such as the Pearson correlation, cannot accurately 

capture  these  complex  relationships.  To  address  this  deficiency,  MIC  analysis  is  often 

recommended  to  detect  both  linear  and  nonlinear  associations  between  two  variables  in  large 

datasets  (Reshef  et  al.,  2011).  MIC  has  been  extensively  used  to  select  candidate  predictors  for

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various research papers related to water quality management, remote sensing, and machine learning applications in hydrological studies. Therefore, I am unable to provide the exact location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. You may need to refer to individual research articles or contact their respective authors for more detailed information regarding the availability of their source codes.
