*Row data is available on GitHub (https://github.com/RedbirdTaiwan/silic). 

The precision, recall and F1 score (Fig. 2) varied differently with the 
threshold score for the six classes. For most classes, precision increases 
and  recall  decreases  as  the  threshold  score  increases.  However,  the 
precision decreases for the northern boobook S-01 and mountain scops- 
owl S-01 as the threshold score increases when the threshold score is 
high (Fig. 2).

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

The  standardized  recordings  are  then  segmented  into  clips  with  a 
fixed duration. There has to be a trade-off between a short clip which 
may include only part of a sound of some species and a long clip which 
increases  the  requirement  of  computing  time  in  model  training.  We 
segment recordings into 3-s clips because the duration of most sound 
classes in our database is less than 3 s. Kahl et al. (2021) used the same 
clip length in their model for identifying the sounds of 984 bird species 
in North America and Europe.

whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the optimization process of the model's hyperparameters.
