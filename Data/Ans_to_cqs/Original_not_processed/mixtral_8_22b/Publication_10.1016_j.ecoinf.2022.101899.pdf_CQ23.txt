Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to esti-
mate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions 
in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automat-
ically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning 
technology. They concluded that this approach could predict a natural 
disaster, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environ-
mental  conditions  before  and  after  wildfires  occurred  using  the  deep 
learning methodology. Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a sea-
sonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This 
measured  spatio-temporal  variations  and  seasonality  across  several 
datasets  and  utilized  this  methodology  to  predict  wildfire  events, 
focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019–2020 wildfire sea-
son  as  an  example  and  measuring  long-term  predictions.  Coen  et  al.

To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

regression models are employed in the recent literature.

2.2.3. Bayesian model averaging 

When  there  are  multiple  predictors,  different  combinations  of  the 
predictors  lead  to  different  models.  Having  multiple  models  that  can 
explain the wildfire probability creates model uncertainty. One of the 
solutions to deal with the model uncertainty is to use Bayesian model 
averaging  (BMA).  Suppose  a  model  space  Ψ  = {m1, m2, …, ms}  is 
composed of s models, each of which includes a combination of available 
predictors. Then, the posterior distribution of each βj is given in Eq. (7)

Therefore, the Bayesian estimate of each parameter is informed by all 
the  considered  models  proportional  to  each  model’s  posterior  model 
probability defined as in Eq. (8):

Helpful Answer:
The authors of Halgamuge et al. (2020) did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they mentioned developing an algorithm to automatically collect data, which might imply some form of data diversification or stratification. Additionally, since they used deep learning technology and analyzed six different optimizer models, it suggests that they may have used some form of cross-validation during training. Nevertheless, without explicit information about these aspects, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
