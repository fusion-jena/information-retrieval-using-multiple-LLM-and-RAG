3. Results 

Section  3.1  presents  the  results  of  our  manual  classification  algo-
rithm. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 provide training and validation results 
for  our  automatic  classifier.  Section  3.1.3  provides  the  results  of  our 
insect microhabitat studies.

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

and computational expense. We used the extracted background features 
generated in our previous step to train an SVM model with 5-fold cross 
validation.  The  training and  validation  of  our  classifier  was  run  on  a 
basic  laptop  using  its  CPU  (Intel(R)  Core(TM)  i7-9850H,  CPU  clock 
speed = 2.60 GHz).

easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training and validation of the classifier were done using 5-fold cross-validation. This method involves splitting the dataset into five equal parts or folds. Four of these folds are used for training, while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. It also allows for a more robust estimation of the model's performance. In this case, the use of 5-fold cross-validation suggests that the training might be considered complete after all five iterations have been performed. Additionally, the mention of validation accuracy in relation to choosing ResNet-50 implies that the model's ability to accurately predict outcomes on the validation set could also play a role in determining when training is complete. However, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
