The patterns found by random forest models are informative about 
the  relationships  between  species-specific  productivity  and  environ-
mental  conditions.  These  models  have  been  extensively  contrasted  to 
explain relationships between variables and estimate their importance 
(Gregorutti  et  al.,  2017),  and  used  in  different  fields  of  ecology,  for 
instance biomass quantification (Kaveh et al., 2023), species distribution 
modeling (Valavi et al., 2021) and genomic studies (Brieuc et al., 2018). 
Although machine learning models cannot explicitly detect proximate 
variables  that  reveal  the  causal  relationships  between  fungal  produc-
tivity and the sampled environment, they can be very helpful in disen-
tangling these complex relationships (Archer and Kimes, 2008). This is 
especially  helpful  in  Mediterranean  environments,  where  mushroom 
productivity is closely related to short-term weather conditions (Alday

resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Mediterranean  forest  ecosystems.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  most 
extensive database of macrofungal productivity in the world.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The sources mentioned discuss various topics like applications of deep learning in ecology, individual-scale variation, species-scale differences, and the use of random forest models in understanding relationships between species-specific productivity and environmental conditions. However, none of them directly mention or provide links to any specific deep learning pipelines or repositories. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
