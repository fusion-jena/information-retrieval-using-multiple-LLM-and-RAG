data stored within these NetCDF files, sourced from either ESA or NASA, 
include vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness 
(Kd940),  and  Chl-a 
(AOT),  Diffuse  Attenuation  Coefficient 
concentrations.

The  landscape  of  aquatic  environmental  monitoring  has  been 
notably transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with 
satellite data interpretation. Pioneering studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim 
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a significant leap in refining 
the  precision  of  satellite-derived  analytical  processes,  particularly  for 
the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al., 2022) have 
spearheaded  the  development of  sophisticated algorithms  tailored for 
atmospheric  correction,  optimized  for  application  with  data  from  the 
Sentinel-3 satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demon-
strate marked efficacy in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations 
within the optically complex waters of shallow lakes.

Beyond obtaining satellite images with high-quality geometric and 
radiometric  information,  many  biogeophysical  parameters  have  been 
obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos 
et  al.,  2019;  Yang  et  al.,  2013).  For  instance,  from  the  spatial  and 
spectral ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer)  sensor,  44  different  standard  data  products  have 
been developed and are classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere 
and  Ocean  products  (Justice  et  al.,  2002).  Moreover,  the  continuous 
development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-

solar  radiation  reflected  by  the  Earth  in  21  spectral  bands  at  spatial 
resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on 
these Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same 
world  region  around  the  same  hour  (see  Table  2)  and  having  a  high 
temporal  resolution  is  essential  for  the  development  of  a  monitoring

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods in conjunction with satellite data interpretation but does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters employed in those models. To find out more about the hyperparameters used in these models, it would be necessary to refer to the original sources cited in the text, such as Cao et al. (2020), Kim et al. (2017), Wu et al. (2008), Binh et al. (2022), Sowmya et al. (2017), Vos et al. (2019), and Yang et al. (2013).
