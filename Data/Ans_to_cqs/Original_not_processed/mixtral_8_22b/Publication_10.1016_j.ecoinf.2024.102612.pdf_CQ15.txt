and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

facing all modern AI-based algorithms is their efficiency in terms of time 
and  tensor  allocation  memory.  Therefore,  only  spatial  and  spectral

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3. 

4. Discussion

convolutional layers and filters, and each variation is trained using input 
point clouds with different kernel configurations. The best results were 
achieved by the LSSegNet3 configuration with an 80.1% MIoU score, 
which  is  not  significantly  different  from  the  76.7%  achieved  in  this 
study.  However,  this  configuration  only  doubled  the  number  of  con-
volutional layers from the previous variations and increased the number 
of kernels used for the classifications; therefore, all the results can be

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, we can infer that some form of optimization technique must have been utilized during the training process of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) since the goal was to achieve optimal performance based on the highest Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) value. Additionally, the fact that the network was trained over 1000 epochs suggests that there might have been a learning rate scheduler involved, which could be part of an optimization algorithm like SGD or Adam. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the implementation of the DNN, it remains uncertain what exact optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
