machine  learning  methods:  Support  Vector  Machines,  Deep  Neural  Networks,  Long  Short  Term  Memory  and 
Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates 
in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Table 2 shows that the PBP method is competitive with state-of-the- 
art  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  the  commonly  used  Random 
Forest (RF) algorithm. The criterion of a false positive rate of at most 0.2 
provides an accuracy of 91.0%, a false positive rate of 8% and a true 
positive  rate  of  75%.  Only  DNN  could  obtain  similar  values  of  true 
positive rate for this case study. Moreover, our method using the criteria

each, all using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function; for 
the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. This suggests that the deployment might have been done locally or on any cloud platform compatible with these libraries. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot determine the exact platform used for deployment.
