CNN has different architectures, such as Le-Net, Alex-Net, Res-Net, 
CapsuleNet, High-Resolution Networks, etc. (Kattenborn et al., 2021). 
This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep 
CNNs  proposed  by  Krizhevsky  et  al.  (2012),  applied  successfully  in 
image scene classification tasks (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021d). 
AlexNet's  triumph  is  attributed  to  practical  strategies  like  ReLU 
nonlinear  layers  and  dropout  regularization  techniques,  making  it 
effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent 
for handling complex problems (Han et al., 2017). Compared to other 
CNN models (e.g., VGG and ResNet), the AlexNet model has a simpler 
structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train 
and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex 
problems (Pu et al., 2019).

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-
nected  layers,  and  three  water-quality  level  labels  including  Class  I, 
Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with 
(cid:0) 4, momentum at 0.9, with the learning rate 
an initial learning rate of 10
halved  every  20  rounds  to  optimize  performance,  culminating  in  the 
selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle.

Helpful Answer:
The study mentioned in the given context uses the AlexNet architecture, which incorporates practical strategies like ReLU nonlinear layers and dropout regularization techniques. Dropout is a regularization method used to prevent overfitting in neural networks, including deep learning pipelines. It works by randomly dropping out neurons during training, effectively creating a sparse network. This helps to reduce co-dependencies between nodes and makes the model more robust to noise in the input data. Additionally, the use of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions also contributes to reducing overfitting, as they help to introduce nonlinearity into the model while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem often encountered with sigmoidal activation functions. However, the text does not explicitly mention any other specific regularization methods, such as L2 regularization, being employed in this particular study.
