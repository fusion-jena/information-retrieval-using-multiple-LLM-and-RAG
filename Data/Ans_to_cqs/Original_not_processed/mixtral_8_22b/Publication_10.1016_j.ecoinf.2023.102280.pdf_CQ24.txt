training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

be  established  (Xie  et  al.,  2021).  Deep  noise  reduction  methods 
(Defossez et al., 2020) often use a U-net architecture which consists of an 
encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent 
space representation. The decoder then uses this latent space to recon-
struct the denoised waveform. Recently, transformer attention mecha-
nisms have also been applied with great success (Cao et al., 2022; Luo 
and  Mesgarani,  2019;  Luo  and  Mesgarani,  2023;  Zhang  et  al.,  2022; 
Zhao et al., 2022). As most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP 
applications, models are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 
22  kHz.  Bioacoustics  applications  commonly  exceed  this  bandwidth. 
Additionally, the sparsity of vocalisations in this application and many 
other  bioacoustics  applications  makes  the  development  of  large-scale 
datasets  infeasible  (Stowell,  2021).  These  factors  limit  the  success  of

Deep learning-based denoising methods are most commonly applied 
to  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  such  as  a  human  speech 
enhancement. D´efossez et al. (Defossez et al., 2020) demonstrated the 
potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) performance and be applied in sub-real time on limited hard-
ware. These methods commonly operate on audio spectrograms but in 
recent  years  SOTA  deep  learning  methods  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  have 
successfully  used  raw  waveform  data  (Luo and  Mesgarani,  2019; Luo 
and Mesgarani, 2023) for wider applications such as source separation 
and classification. This removes errors introduced when applying a Fast 
Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  to  generate  a  time-frequency  representation 
and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. These 
networks tend to require more data for training as the latent space must

The generation of ground-truth training data from noisy samples is a 
practical  limitation  for  deep  learning  audio  enhancement  models.  To 
approximate “clean” ground-truth data, we apply spectral subtraction to 
remove noise from the signal then superimpose randomly sampled noise 
onto  the  ground-truth  to  generate  the  noisy  input. Noise  is  randomly 
sampled  from  a  dataset  containing  963  five-second  noise  samples 
collated  from  field  recordings.  Samples  contain  both  stationary  back-
ground  noise  and  non-target  transient  noise  features  including  rain, 
wind gusts, vehicles, banging etc. Given the nature of the training data it 
is expected that model performance converges to that of spectral sub-
traction.  This  study  evaluates  the  performance  of  pre-trained  audio 
enhancement  models  on  transient  features.  Given  sufficient  training 
data, transient noise reduction is a potential benefit of audio enhance-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common practices in handling randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results across different initializations, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. In the case of generating training data for fine-tuning, the context mentions collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles to create both input data and a 'denoised' ground truth. Random sampling of noise from a dataset is mentioned, but specific strategies to manage randomness in this process aren't discussed.
