assigns different weights to each prefusion layer to facilitate adaptive 
feature  fusion.  In  Fig.  6,  we  present  a  novel  feature  fusion  network 
named  the  CRFPN,  which  combines  the  attention  mechanism  with 
feature  fusion.  After  extracting  features  using  the  backbone  network, 
three  output  layers  are  obtained  through  multiple  upsampling  and 
downsampling operations. However, due to the depth of the network, 
some information may be lost, leading to potential negative impacts. To 
address these issues, we propose incorporating a feature layer derived 
from the backbone network, processed by the attention module, as the 
output  layer  for  feature  fusion.  This  approach  not  only  enhances  se-
mantic  information  by  aggregating  additional  characteristics  but  also 
mitigates  the  loss  of  original  information  caused  by  the  increasing 
network depth.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

4.4. Data augmentation 

Data augmentation techniques play a crucial role in augmenting the 
training dataset to enhance the learning effect and generalization per-
formance of the network. This experiment uses various data augmen-
tation methods, including HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, 
flipping, and mosaicking, to expand the dataset. Random probabilities 
are used to determine whether each image should undergo augmenta-
tion. HSV  adjustment involves modifying  the image's  hue, saturation, 
and value components. And rotation randomly rotates the image within 
a specific range. Moreover, scaling changes the size of the image while 
maintaining its aspect ratio. Cropping randomly crops a portion of the 
image.  Additionally,  Flipping  horizontally  flips  the  image.  Mosaic 
combines  multiple  randomly  cropped,  resized,  and  rotated  images  to

The convolutional layer, batch normalization (BN) layer, and SiLU 
activation function are combined to form the CBS block. The SPPF (Li 
et  al.,  2021)  block  operates  three  maximum  pooling  layers,  and  then 
each branch is aggregated to the concat layer. It is capable of combining 
information  from  several  scales.  The  CRFPN  is  utilized  in  the  neck 
portion to combine the extractive features and convey information to the 
head  portion.  Finally,  the  head  predicts  and  presents  the  bounding 
boxes, classes, and concordance scores.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss data augmentation techniques used to improve the training dataset and enhance the learning effect and generalization performance of the network. These techniques include HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking. While these techniques do not directly address data bias, they help increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially mitigate some forms of bias by introducing variations in the data. Nevertheless, addressing data bias typically requires more targeted strategies like those mentioned in the query.
