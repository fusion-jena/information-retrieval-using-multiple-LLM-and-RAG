Description and Parameters

2.  According to the cloud architecture, GEE is a SaaS (Software-as-a- 
service). This translates into services (e.g., available datasets, allo-
cated resources, implemented algorithms, export data formats, and 
so on) entirely managed by Google and not (or hardly) modifiable by 
the single user. For instance, in GEE deep learning analysis can be 
performed  using  Tensorflow,  a  machine  learning  and  artificial  in-
telligence  open-source  framework  developed  by  the  Google  Brain 
team (Abadi et al., 2016). Although Tensorflow is one of the leading 
machine  learning  frameworks,  this  excludes  the  possibility  of 
employing different open-source machine learning systems such as 
PyTorch primarily developed by Facebook AI Research lab (FAIR) 
(Ketkar and Jojo, 2021), Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (Seide 
and Amit, 2016), Caffe of the University of California, Berkeley, US 
(Jia et al., 2014) or novel algorithms for deep learning (Zhu et al.,

When  nasawebservice  has  to  deal  with  large  volume  of  requests,  the 
choice to use an iterator improves the memory management for the data

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by Google Brain Team, is employed for performing deep learning analyses within the Google Earth Engine (GEE). TensorFlow supports various optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc., but without further information, we cannot determine which specific technique is being utilized in this case.
