Fig. 1 shows an extract from a JSON file that includes the identifier 
number, metric name with results (output), evaluation score, debugging 
messages, and a  summary of  all metrics in  the evaluation. Finally, to 
visualize the scores after compiling all the PIDs, we created a report by 
running a computational notebook (. ipynb document) provided by the 
FAIRsFAIR team (Devaraju and Huber, 2021a). This notebook provides 
an overall analysis and visualisation of all PID responses assessed using 
the F-UJI. 

In summary, a) the report reads JSON’s responses, b) collects all the 
total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame, and c) visualises the 
metrics  and  summarises  the  evaluations  (in  our  case,  the  datasets 
associated with each repository). The characteristics of the report are 
discussed in the Section 3. 

For further analysis, two aspects of the findings of this study were 

considered.

improvement. Finally, the datasets published in the Zenodo and Dryad 
repositories had the best results in terms of the FAIR principles, with Ag 
Data  Commons  (an  institutional  repository  in  the  agricultural  area) 
being rated third-best.

3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
