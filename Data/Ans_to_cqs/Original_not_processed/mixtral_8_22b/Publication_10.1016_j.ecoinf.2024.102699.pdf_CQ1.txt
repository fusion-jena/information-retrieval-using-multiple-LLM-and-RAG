For the ViT models, we adapted the approach of pretraining deep
bidirectional transformers for language understanding (BERT) by Devlin
et al. (2018) for birdsong classification. Table 3 provides an overview of
the investigated ViT models with their respective parameterizations.
ViT-S/16, for example, denotes a ViT variant of reduced complexity with
an input patch size of 16 × 16. The sequence length of the transformer
models is inversely proportional to the square of the provided patch size.
In the following, ViT-B/16 is further investigated as it strikes a balance
between general model complexity and classification performance.

Overview of our augmentation strategies, their IDs, and related information. For DenseNet-161 and ViT-B/16, their training times are provided in minutes per epoch
for the different augmentation methods. For IDs 5 and 6, we added noise of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge (Berger et al., 2018; Himawan
et al., 2018; Liaqat et al., 2018), which is abbreviated as BAD.

domized partial time and frequency stretching, which are frequently
used in speech recognition, and randomly added weighted noise samples
extracted from audio chunks that did not contain bird events.

In ecology, changes in environmental conditions are often closely linked to shifts in species diversity. This
relationship can be investigated by analyzing avian vocalizations, which are robust indicators of trends in
biodiversity. Within this contribution, we explored various data augmentation techniques and deep learning
strategies for the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes. For this purpose, we employed three
fundamental deep neural network architectures, such as vision transformers, to classify 397 different bird spe-
cies. To improve both the accuracy and generalizability of our models, we incorporated up to 19 well-established
data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included an iterative selection process
where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation
technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the nature of the dataset used. In the context, it mentions the use of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge, which suggests that the authors might have collected raw data using publicly available datasets. Additionally, the context discusses the incorporation of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements into the dataset, indicating that the authors may have also used additional sources of data beyond the initial dataset. Nevertheless, without more explicit information on the data collection methods, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were specifically used for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
