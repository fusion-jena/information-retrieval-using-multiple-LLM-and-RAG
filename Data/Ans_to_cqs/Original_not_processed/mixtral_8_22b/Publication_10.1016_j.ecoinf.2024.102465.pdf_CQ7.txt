employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't a direct mention of the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use various methods to divide datasets. Some popular techniques include random splitting, stratified sampling, time series based splitting, etc.

Random splitting involves dividing the dataset randomly into different subsets like training, testing, and validation. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Time series based splitting is useful when dealing with temporal data, where the order of events matters.

In this particular context, since the research focuses on utilizing deep learning models like ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and HRNet for tasks such as sentiment analysis and semantic segmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that standard practices were followed while splitting the data. These could involve any of the mentioned techniques depending upon the nature of the dataset and the problem statement.
