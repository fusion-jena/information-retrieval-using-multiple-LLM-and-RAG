loss function, effectively preventing overfitting and promoting simpler 
models,  utilization  of  a  more  advanced  optimization  approach  that 
combines  first-order  gradients  (loss  function  gradient)  with  second- 
order  gradients  (loss  function  curvature)  which  makes  it  faster  than 
some other models, ability to handle missing data during tree building 
by  employing  weighted  quantile  sketch,  built-in  cross-validation  sup-
port  that  aids  the  model  evaluation  and  hyperparameter  tuning,  and 
imbalanced  data  handling.  Thanks  to  its  exceptional  efficiency  and 
performance and its availability in various programming languages like 
Python, R, and Java, XGBoost has found widespread adoption in land-
slide risk assessment (Akinci et al., 2021; Badola et al., 2023; Can et al., 
2021; Hussain et al., 2022b).

Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

pending data availability, we will investigate the scalability and trans-
ferability  of  the  ensemble  techniques  and  compare  their  performance 
with  deep  learning  models  such  as  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). This 
broader  investigation  would  provide  a  more  robust  understanding  of 
landslide vulnerability across the entire and offer valuable insights into 
the effectiveness of advanced ML approaches in LSM.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, based on common practices in the field, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow and PyTorch. Other possible options could be Keras or MXNet. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.

Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on machine learning models rather than specifically deep learning models. The context mentions several machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). While ANNs are technically considered a subset of deep learning models, they are often grouped together with traditional machine learning models due to their similarities in structure and application. Therefore, while it is likely that some form of deep learning framework may have been used to implement these models, this cannot be confirmed without additional information.
