the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The

sets of aligned RGB images and depth images were manually labelled 
and divided into training (80% images), validation (10% images), and 
test sets (10% images). Data augmentation techniques such as scaling, 
panning, rotation, colour transformation, and mosaic were employed to 
increase  the  number of  training samples and  improve  model general-
ization ability. Pretrained weights were loaded to evaluate their impact 
on detection results. Models were trained for 300 epochs and evaluated 
on the validation set after each epoch.

Intel i7 eight-core CPU (3.0 GHz), an Nvidia RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have implemented several strategies to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did not explicitly mention the use of common regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, they focused on other techniques to mitigate overfitting.

One approach mentioned in the text is the use of data augmentation techniques, including scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic. These techniques help increase the number of training samples and improve the model's generalization ability by introducing variations in the dataset.

Additionally, the authors ensured that the models followed back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. This strategy helps prevent underfitting by allowing the model to learn more effectively from larger batches of data.

Furthermore, the authors employed pretrained weights to evaluate their impact on detection results. Using pretrained weights can act as a form of regularization since these weights have already been optimized for similar tasks, which may help reduce overfitting when fine-tuning the model for a new task.

Lastly, the authors used a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Learning rate decay was also applied after specific iterations. These optimization strategies can contribute to preventing overfitting by controlling the learning process and avoiding rapid convergence to suboptimal solutions.
