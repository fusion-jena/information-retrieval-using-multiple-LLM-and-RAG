Separate  two-class  models  were  trained  for  Finnmark  and  Yamal 
using  the  keras  package  in  R  (Allaire  and  Chollet,  2023)  with  a  Ten-
sorFlow  backend (Allaire  and Tang,  2023).  Preliminary trials  showed 
that region-specific models performed better. The ResNet-50 architec-
ture, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep (He et al., 
2015), was used to train the models with 55 epochs (number of times the 
algorithm goes through the entire training data set) and a batch size of 
64  (number  of  samples  to  work  through  before  updating  model  pa-
rameters)  with  a  one-cycle  learning  rate  (hyperparameter  controlling 
model  response  to  estimated  error  each  time  the  model  weights  are 
updated) policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 
(Smith, 2018).

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The deep learning model used in this study employed the ResNet-50 architecture, which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. The model was trained using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend. The hyperparameters used in the model include a learning rate with a one-cycle learning rate policy, having a minimum value of 0.000001 and a maximum value of 0.001. Additionally, the model was trained with 55 epochs and a batch size of 64. However, the specific optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
