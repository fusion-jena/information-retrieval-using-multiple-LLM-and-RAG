Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was utilized for machine learning training using 34 ground data points. The RF generates an unbiased internal estimate of generalization error through out-of-bag (OOB) samples, which are not included in the training subset. The total number of samples used for validation is mentioned as 8. Furthermore, the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software was employed to perform classification utilizing the RF technique based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images. The optimal hyperparameter values for the RF model were determined through testing various combinations, resulting in the best performance when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. Nevertheless, there is no explicit mention of the model deployment process or any platform selection for its implementation.
