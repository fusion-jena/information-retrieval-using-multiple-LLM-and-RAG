Performance of the CNN models were assessed using four different 
metrics (test loss, mean squared error - MSE, mean average percentage 
error – MAPE and accuracy - Acc). Accuracy of the regression tasks was 
calculated  by  rounding  the  prediction  to  the  nearest  integer  age  and 
comparing it with the ground truth. The labelling provided by human 
readers  are  treated  as  the  ground  truth,  and  accuracy  and  other  per-
formance metrics relates directly to this. 

The CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks 
during training are shown in Table 1. During training we use minibatch 
gradient descent.

2.3. Implementation and training 

The  CNN  was  implemented  using  the  Keras  (Chollet,  2015)  and 
TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.,  2016)  software  packages  implemented  in 
Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and 
CuDNN  with  Nvidia  (Nvidia  Corp.,  Santa  Clara,  California)  P100 
accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. We used a Keras imple-
mentation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 (https://github. 
com/qubvel/efficientnet).  The  pre-trained  weights  used  for  transfer 
learning were available through this API.

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models is evaluated using four different metrics: test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy (Acc). For regression tasks, such as predicting River Age, Sea Age, and Spawning, accuracy is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth. The labels provided by human readers are considered the ground truth, and accuracy and other performance metrics relate directly to these labels.

In summary, the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model include:

1. Test Loss: A measure of how well the model performs on unseen data during testing. Lower values indicate better performance.

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values suggest better performance.

3. Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE): This provides the average absolute percent error between predictions and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

4. Accuracy (Acc): For classification tasks, this represents the proportion of correct classifications out of total instances. For regression tasks, it is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth.
