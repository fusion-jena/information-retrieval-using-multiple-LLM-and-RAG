This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in making accurate predictions or classifications based on input data. Without further information, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used in this case.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used some form of metric to evaluate their deep learning model's performance. Still, without explicit details about these metrics, we cannot provide a definitive answer. It would be best to refer directly to the original paper or contact the authors for more precise information regarding the evaluation metrics employed in their study.
