Note: Table data adapted from (Cohen, 1960; Landis and Koch, 1977).

In the ArcGIS 10.5 software, the Landscape Fragmentation Tool
(LFT) (Uddin et al., 2015; Vogt et al., 2006), was utilized to generate
fragmentation maps. Initially, the LULC maps were converted into a
binary format (foreground/background). The Forest and Scrub/Herba-
ceous vegetation classes were designated as the foreground, while the
remaining classes (Artificial surfaces, Agricultural areas, Open spaces
with little or no vegetation and Water bodies) comprised the
background.

2.3.4. Sampling size and validation areas

On this occasion, to define the training and testing samples, we relied
on Chuvieco (2020), who argues that for categorical variables, at least
196 test points should be considered. Furthermore, Chuvieco (2020),
also mentions that, at times, this number can be very small when
compared to the total number of pixels in the image. Therefore, we
explored new sampling strategies that combine the previous scientific
foundation with the current capabilities of GEE.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that at least 196 test points should be considered for defining training and testing samples. This could imply that the completion of training might depend on reaching a certain level of performance on these test points. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in validation loss, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or completing a set number of epochs. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria are being used in this case.
