Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to the input data. These techniques help improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

The text mentions that the YOLO DCNN was used with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset, but it does not specify if any additional data augmentation techniques were applied during the training process. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined what specific data augmentation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
