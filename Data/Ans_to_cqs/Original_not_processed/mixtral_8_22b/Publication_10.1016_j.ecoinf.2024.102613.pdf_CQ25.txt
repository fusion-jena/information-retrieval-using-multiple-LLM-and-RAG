Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of a deep learning model can vary depending on its specific design and implementation. However, some common purposes include classification, where the model categorizes input data into predefined classes; segmentation, where it separates parts of an image or other input data; and detection, where it identifies objects within input data. Without additional context about the specific deep learning model mentioned in this case, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its purpose.

Based on the given context, we can see that the authors have used a deep neural network for fully automatic fish biomass estimation. This suggests that the deep learning model in this scenario might be designed for regression, as it involves predicting continuous values rather than classifying or detecting discrete categories. However, without further details about the architecture and training process of the deep learning model, this remains speculative.
