Though the original architecture of Koch et al., (2015) used
regularized cross entropy as a loss function, better performance may
be achieved with other loss functions instead of cross entropy, as
mentioned by Wang and Deng, (2021). Contrastive loss takes as input
a pair of samples that are either similar or dissimilar, and brings
similar samples closer and dissimilar samples far apart. It is, there-
fore, a better choice for learning a metric. Contrastive loss has been
successfully used recently in several papers in machine learning as
well as with Siamese networks and outstanding results have been
reported for using it even in unsupervised contrastive learning (see e.
g., (Aruna Gladys and Vetriselvi, 2023; Choi and Kim, 2022; He et al.,
2019; Huang et al., 2019; Lian et al., 2018; Melekhov et al., 2016;

Wang et al., 2021; Wang and Liu, 2021; Wu et al., 2018; Yu et al.,

2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

showed that the CNN outperforms the traditional classification methods.
Salman et al., (2016) compared traditional classification methods such
as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbours (K(cid:0) NN), and Sparse Representation
Classifier with CNN. They achieve an average classification rate of more
than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 (Joly et al., 2014) and LifeCLEF15 (Joly
et al., 2015) fish datasets using CNN and generally a significantly lower
rate using the traditional methods. Siddiqui et al., (2017) reaches clas-
sification accuracy of 94.3% performance on fish species classification
using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach for enhanced
discriminative ability to handle the limited labeled training data prob-

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, from general knowledge, we can mention that common regularization methods include Dropout, L1 Regularization, and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting.

L1 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, which encourages sparsity in the weights.

L2 Regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, which discourages large weights and encourages smaller ones.

These regularization methods help to reduce overfitting by adding constraints to the optimization process, making the model more generalizable to new data.
