Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data. However, some relevant information can still be extracted from the text.

Firstly, the authors mention that the number and spatial distribution of samples are important factors to consider when creating a representative dataset for training a machine learning-based model. This implies that they might have ensured diversity within their dataset by including samples from various locations and sources.

Secondly, the context mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and extreme machine learning methods, which often employ techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting during the training process to improve the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Although these specific techniques are not directly referenced in the context, it is possible that similar approaches could have been employed to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.

Lastly, the importance of considering different atmospheric correction algorithms is highlighted, suggesting that the researchers may have accounted for this factor when processing the hyperspectral data before feeding it into the deep learning model. By doing so, they would likely reduce noise and variability caused by atmospheric conditions, thus improving the overall robustness and generalizability of the model.

In conclusion, based on the available context, we cannot definitively state the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, there are indications that the researchers considered factors like sample diversity, potential application of validation techniques, and accounting for atmospheric effects in their approach.
