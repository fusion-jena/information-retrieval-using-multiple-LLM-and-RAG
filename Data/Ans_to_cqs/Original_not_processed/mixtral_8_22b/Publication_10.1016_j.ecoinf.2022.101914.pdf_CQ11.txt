answering certain questions (Sofaer et al., 2019). Either way, this pro-
vides a clear argument for the need to carefully consider the question at 
hand and the makeup of data used to train component models prior to 
performing the analysis. However, the result strongly suggests the need 
for  further  work  using  controlled  simulations  (e.g.,  Chiaverini  et  al., 
2021; Atzeni et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021) that can generate known 
habitat  relationships.  A  simulation  experiment  would  then  enable 
objective assessment of which of the metrics (TSS or AUC) is performing 
correctly, or if both are biased in different ways across the parameter 
space.
