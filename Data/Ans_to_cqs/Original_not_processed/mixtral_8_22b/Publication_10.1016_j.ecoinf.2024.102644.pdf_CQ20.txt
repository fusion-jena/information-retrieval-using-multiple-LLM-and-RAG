The selected species belonged to animal groups such as birds (80%, 
140  species),  insects  (15%,  30  species),  and  other  species  (reptiles, 
amphibians, mammals, fishes, crustaceans) (5%, 10 species) (Fig. S2). 
These groups accounted for 73% (birds), 22% (insects), and 100% (other 
species) of the total reported species in GBIF in each group. Birds were 
the  most  reported  animals  because  of  the  basin’s  high  migration
