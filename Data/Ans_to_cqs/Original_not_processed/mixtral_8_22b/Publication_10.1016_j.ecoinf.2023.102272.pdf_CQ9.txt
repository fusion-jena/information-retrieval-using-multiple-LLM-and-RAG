2.5. Model selection procedure 

The model selection procedure was performed as follows (Capinha 
et  al.,  2021;  Van  Kuppevelt  et  al.,  2020):  we  randomly  generated  5 
models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types (20 
models in total) and trained each one with a small subset of the training 
data  (data  partition  At)  for  4  epochs  (an  “epoch”  corresponds  to  the 
complete training dataset being passed forward and backward across the 
network  one  time;  Capinha  et  al.,  2021).  The  accuracy  of  candidate 
models,  as  provided  by  mcfly  (i.e.,  the  “proportion  of  cases  correctly 
classified”), was then compared using a left-out validation data set (data 
partition Av) and the model with the highest performance was selected 
for training on the full training data (data partition Bt; Bt = At + Av) for 
up to 30 epochs.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given context about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be stored in any of the mentioned repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without further details, it cannot be determined exactly where it is located.
