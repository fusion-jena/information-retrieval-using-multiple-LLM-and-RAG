Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.

• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Query-time adaptation (transductive inference) was shown in mul-
tiple cases to lead to very strong performance, within both the proto-
typical  and  fine-tuning  paradigms.  This  comes  at  a  cost  of  added 
complexity  and  added  query-time  computation,  since  typically  a  new 
run of statistical optimisation must be performed for a new query task. 
Thus, from the present results we can recommend that a system should 
include query-time adaptation for the best possible detections, but that a 
system without query-time adaptation should be a widespread default. 
Such fixed embeddings can easily be used off-the-shelf, in the same way 
that  other  pretrained  networks  are  now  commonly  downloaded  and 
used.  The  DFSL  method  employed  by  Wu_SHNU  is  an  alternative 
approach  which  combines  an  unchanging  feature  extraction  with  a 
query-time  adaptive  weighting.  This  combines  stability  with  dynamic 
adaptation, and thus is worthy of further investigation.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned. However, it does mention that long audio files are divided into shorter chunks so that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. This suggests that GPU resources were likely utilized during the training process due to their ability to handle parallel computations efficiently. Nevertheless, the exact type or number of GPUs used remains unknown based on the provided context.
