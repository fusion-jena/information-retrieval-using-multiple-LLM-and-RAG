Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text does not provide any details regarding the configuration of the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, activation functions, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the available information.
