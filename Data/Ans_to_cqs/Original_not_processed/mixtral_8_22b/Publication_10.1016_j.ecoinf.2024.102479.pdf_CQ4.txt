hyperparameters  in  a  model.  It  identifies  the  most  effective  set  of 
hyperparameters  that  enhance  the  model's  performance.  During 
training,  GSCV  generates  a  series  of  models,  each  characterized  by  a 
different  set  of  hyperparameters.  The  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
systematically train and assess the performance of these various models 
through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the 
model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by 
its optimal hyperparameter combination (Adnan et al., 2022). Details of 
the primary tuning parameters, their range and the optimal combination 
of  hyperparameters  utilized  for  each  algorithm  for  each  model  are 
shown in Table 1.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model.
