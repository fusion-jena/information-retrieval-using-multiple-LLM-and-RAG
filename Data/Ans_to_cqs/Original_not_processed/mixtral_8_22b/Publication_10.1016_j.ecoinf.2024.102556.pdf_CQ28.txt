The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (DollÂ´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

exhibited  a  faster  loading  time,  which  is  crucial  for  deployment  in 
remote  areas. However, this model has not yet been demonstrated in 
practice for deployment on UAV platforms with limited computational 
resources.  Therefore,  the  flexibility  of  the  applicability  of  this  model 
remains controversial.

In recent years, the integration of UAV technology and deep learning 
(DL) has resulted in extensive applications in wildlife monitoring. DL is 
equipped  with  UAV  technology  and  can  analyze  massive  amounts  of 
data  in  real  time, addressing  issues  associated  with  low detection  ac-
curacy, high model complexity, and poor real-time effects of traditional 
machine learning methods. This combination effectively addresses the 
inefficient  nature  of  wildlife  monitoring, 
time-consuming  and 

particularly in challenging high-altitude environments. Fig. 1 illustrates 
its key concepts. In addition, the combination of UAVs and DL has been 
applied  in  a  diverse  array  of  animal  studies.  These  include  mapping 
habitats,  estimating  species  abundance  and  distribution,  measuring 
physiological parameters, assisting in anti-poaching efforts, and study-
ing anti-predator responses (Schad and Fischer, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Instead, it appears that the deep learning model was intended for deployment on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform with limited computational resources. It is also noted that while the model exhibited fast loading times, its practical application on UAV platforms remains controversial due to lack of demonstration in practice.
