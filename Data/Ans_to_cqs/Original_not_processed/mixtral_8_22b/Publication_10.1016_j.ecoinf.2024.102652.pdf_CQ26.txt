2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

to construct soil salinity maps, semantic segmentation—the process of 
assigning a category label to each pixel of an image—is applied to the 
image via the MU-NET deep learning method.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does state that the training set must be normalized and standardized before fitting into the network. Normalization and standardization are common techniques used in preprocessing to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and prevent biases due to different scales or ranges of values. These methods do not directly address class imbalance but help in scaling the input features to improve the performance of the model. Therefore, while the text does not provide information about addressing data bias through techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does indicate the use of normalization and standardization for preprocessing the dataset.
