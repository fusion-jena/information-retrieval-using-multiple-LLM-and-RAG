NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

denoting  a  Gaussian  process  (MacKay,  2003).  During  model  fitting, 
hyperparameters  are  determined  from  the  data  using  methods  like 
maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches, accommoda-
ting diverse datasets with varying complexities (Sun et al., 2022; Wil-
liams and Rasmussen, 2006). Once fitted, GPR enables predictions for 
new  data  points,  offering  both  point  estimates  and  insights  into  pre-
diction uncertainty (MacKay, 2003).

2.4.2. Wind2TSM model 

To achieve the aims of the study, a distinctive model was devised to 
estimate the average concentration of TSM in the lake, utilizing solely 
wind speed as input, we utilized five machine learning methodologies: 
linear regression (LR) as described by Freedman (2009), regression trees 
(RT) from Verhallen and Bus (2010),  support vector machines  (SVM) 
introduced by Cortes and Vapnik (1995), Gaussian process regression 
(GPR) detailed by MacKay (2003), and NN models based on Hardesty

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed through various methods such as model serialization, where the model is saved in a file format that can be loaded later for use, or platform selection, which involves choosing a suitable environment for running the model, such as cloud services or edge devices. However, without further details about the specific case mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a more precise response.
