the collected data. Finally, the deep learning algorithms are evaluated and the challenges
of monitoring IAPS are discussed.

When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the references mentioned. For instance, reference 31 discusses accelerating image-based ecological surveys with interactive machine learning, suggesting that image data might be collected through ecological surveys. Additionally, references 32 and 33 focus on benefits of hyperspectral remote sensing for tracking plant invasions and early detection of invasive weeds, respectively. These sources imply that remote sensing techniques could also be employed for gathering raw data. Lastly, the use of MobileNetV2 and ResNet50V2 models suggests that image data is involved, possibly obtained from publicly available datasets or custom collections. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it remains unclear what exact methods are utilized for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
