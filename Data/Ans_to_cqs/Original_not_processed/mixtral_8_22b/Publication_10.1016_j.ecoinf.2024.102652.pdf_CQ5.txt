2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

to construct soil salinity maps, semantic segmentation—the process of 
assigning a category label to each pixel of an image—is applied to the 
image via the MU-NET deep learning method.

substantial human adjustment and pure subject knowledge to deploy. 
With the proposed deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, soil 
salinity and vegetation can be detected and segmented without the need 
for ongoing field EC measurements, and salinity can be monitored and 
managed automatically. The U-NET method has been used in numerous 
remote sensing image classification-related tasks, such as olive canopy 
extraction (Abo-Ragab, 2014) and the extraction of saline soil (Gu et al., 
2022). Furthermore, this approach has a wide range of applications in 
medical  picture  recognition  and  segmentation  (Ouyang  et  al.,  2023). 
This method has been shown to produce satisfactory outcomes in a range 
of situations. In this study, we added five salinity indices to the original 
5-band multispectral image, increasing the total number of bands. We 
applied  a  deep  learning  modified  U-NET  (MU-NET)  algorithm  to

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training set must have its data normalized and standardized before fitting into the network. It also states that the purpose of using a batch size of 32 was to not exceed the memory limit and to make full use of computer resources. This suggests that the dataset could potentially be large or complex enough to require careful management of computational resources. Additionally, the context discusses the application of the MU-NET deep learning method for semantic segmentation of images to construct soil salinity maps. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset likely consists of remote sensing images related to soil salinity. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the dataset, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
