More recently, there has been a great effort to automate the process 
of classification/mapping of specific targets using Deep Learning (Lecun 
et al., 2015) algorithms, such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN), which 
includes  a  learning  algorithm  based  on  an  artificial  neural  network 
(Langford et al., 2019). In this study, we developed a semi-automatic 
methodological approach for mapping burned areas in the entire Cer-
rado  biome  in  Brazil  using  Deep  Learning  techniques  available  on 
Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery, which consist of eleven 
spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1-7 and 9, 
15 meters for band 8, and 100 meters for bands 10 and 11. We did not 
use  Landsat-7  imagery  because  of  the  data  gaps  observed  images  ac-
quired after 2003, which would substantially affect the spatial coverage 
of  our  analysis.  We  assessed  accuracies  and  compared  our  mapping

2.1. Study region

Since  deep  learning  methods  require  a  powerful  computational 
processing, we conducted our analysis using graphics processing units 
(GPUs)  and  specialized  hardware  components  for  running  parallel 
arithmetic operations (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The access to GPUs in a 
virtual  machine  environment  was  implemented  on  the  Google  Cloud 
suite  of  cloud 
Platform

3.1. Optimal period of burn scar mapping 

The fire hotspot data analysis provided by INPE (http://www.inpe. 
br/queimadas/bdqueimadas)  indicates  that  most  of  the  fire  events  in 
the  Cerrado  biome  occurred  between  May  and  December,  showing  a 
peak in September 2017 (Fig. 4). Based on it, we focused our mapping 
analysis of burn scars on the period between May and December, which 
comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017 by INPE. 

3.2. Burned areas in 2017

We used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images 
and Deep Neural Network models to detect and map burned areas within 
the  Cerrado  biome.  The  image  processing  and  classification  followed 
four steps as follows: (1) collecting spectral training samples of burned 
and non-burned areas for the entire study area, well distributed in space, 
(2) training the deep learning models, (3) developing model prediction, 
and (4) model assessment (validation and concordance analysis). Fig. 2 
uses  step-by-step  bases  to  show  all  details  of  our  methodological 
approach for detecting and mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome 
in 2017.

2.4. Burned area mapping 

Deep  Neural  Network  (DNN)  is  a  learning  algorithm  based  on  an 
artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers (Langford et al., 
2019).  The  DNN  models  use  hierarchical  data  processing,  where  the 
input data in each module (called the hidden layer) results in an output 
that  is  an  input  for  the  next  module,  connected through  weights  and 
biases  whose  values  were  learned  during  the  training  of  the  network 
(Bramhe et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework or library, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to develop the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome. However, it mentions that the analysis was conducted using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations, which are commonly utilized in deep learning applications. Furthermore, the context states that the access to GPUs was implemented on the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform, suggesting that the deep learning models might have been built using tools compatible with Google Cloud services, like TensorFlow or Keras. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact framework employed, one cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another tool was used to construct the deep learning model.
