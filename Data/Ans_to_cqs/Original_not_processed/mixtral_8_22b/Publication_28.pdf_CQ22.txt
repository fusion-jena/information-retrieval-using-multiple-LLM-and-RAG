This  section  offers  a  brief  experimental  results  analysis  of  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model over the other techniques. Table 1 and Fig. 6 assess 
the  classification  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE  model  with 
other techniques on the applied UCM dataset. On examining the results 
interms  of  precision,  the  experimental  results  showcased  that  the 
PTDLEN-VAE model has accomplished maximum average precision of 
96% whereas the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques 
have  gained  a  minimum  average  precision  of  95.70%,  95.68%,  and 
95.49% respectively. Followed by, on investigative the outcomes with 
respect  to  recall,  the  experimental  outcomes  demonstrated  that  the 
PTDLEN-VAE  manner  has  accomplished  maximal  average  recall  of 
95.35% whereas the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM methods 
have reached a lesser average recall of 94.90%, 94.93%, and 94.73% 
correspondingly. Eventually, on exploratory the outcomes interms of F1-

A  detailed  comparative  outcomes  analysis  of  the  PTDLEN-VAE 
manner  takes  place  with  other  techniques  on  the  AIM  dataset  in

that  the  CNN-RBFNN,  CA-CNN–BiLSTM,  and  CNN  manners have  out-
performed  least  performance  over  the  other  techniques.  In  line  with, 
MLRSSC-CGNN-SGAT,  MLRSSC-CGNN-MLGAT,  and  AL-RCNN  algo-
rithms have accomplished reasonably closer results. Besides, the DLEN- 
LSTM,  DLEN-DNN,  and  DLEN-VAE  approaches  have  resulted  in 
competitive  outcomes  with  respect  to  various  measures.  But,  the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score. Precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single metric for evaluating the overall performance of the model. F2-score is similar to F1-score but gives more weightage to recall than precision. In this case, the performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model was compared with other techniques based on these metrics. For instance, on the UCM dataset, the PTDLEN-VAE model achieved a maximum average precision of 96%, while the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques had a minimum average precision of 95.70%, 95.68%, and 95.49%, respectively. Similarly, the PTDLEN-VAE model achieved a maximum average recall of 95.35%, while the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques had a lower average recall of 94.90%, 94.93%, and 94.73%, respectively.
