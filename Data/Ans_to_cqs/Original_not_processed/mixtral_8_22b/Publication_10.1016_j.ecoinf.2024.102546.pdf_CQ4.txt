3.1. Dataset curation

jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements random crop 
and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly 
with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 
800  Ã— 800  pixels,  which  is  compatible  with  model  architectures  and 
training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of 
each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the 
original image aspect ratio. All models were trained for 40 epochs with 
batch  size  8,  which  could  adequately  converge  based  on  empirical 
observations.

different modules of I3Net.  Unlike training the YOLO models without 
domain adaptation, a different learning rate scheme was implemented to 
train the I3Net modules. Considering the embedded noise in unpaired 
target  domain  images  may  adversely  affect  early-stage  training,  the 
initial  learning  rate  was  set  to  0.001  for  training  the  I3Net  modules, 
which  aimed  to  ensure  the  effective  learning  of  source-domain  infor-
mation, being less disturbed by the target domain images, and thereafter 
the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance feature adaptation 
to  the  target  domain.  Other  hyperparameter  settings  remained  as 
described in Table 2.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline used jitter and mosaic augmentations. Additionally, DINO implemented random crop and scale augmentation. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models by introducing variations into the dataset during training. Jitter involves randomly perturbing the pixel values within an image, while mosaic augmentation combines multiple images into one to create new training samples. Random cropping extracts smaller regions from the original images, and scaling adjusts the size of the images.
