Furthermore, ANN techniques have recently been used to predict the 
bark thickness of ash plants and hypericin content in Hypericum perfo-
ratum with 80% accuracy (Mosaffaei and Jahani, 2021; Saffariha et al., 
2021). Shang and Zhu (2021) have also proposed a prediction model 
that  combines  the  genetic  algorithm  and  ML  algorithms-  ANN  -  to 
forecast the occurrence of insect pests. Weather data with an extreme 
learning machine (ELM) and using AICR potato database was used for 
potato disease infection and archived accuracy of 91.5% (Singh et al., 
2018). Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data techniques have 
been applied to investigate disease factors and  effectively handle dis-
eases  within  the  field  Fenu  and  Malloci,  2021).  Xiao  et  al.  (2018) 
developed  a  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  model  to  predict  the 
presence  of  pests  like  bollworm,  whitefly,  and  jassid,  as  well  as  leaf

Previously,  Mosaffaei  and  Jahani  (2021)  have  been  successful  in 
predicting the bark thickness of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in urban forests 
using 10 ecological variables through ANN and regression models with 
61.6 and 83% accuracy. Shang and Zhu (2021) have also proposed a 
prediction  model  that  combines  the  genetic  algorithm  and  machine 
learning algorithms- ANN - to forecast the occurrence of insect pests. 
Similarly,  Saffariha  et  al.  (2021)  observed  that  for  the  prediction  of 
hypericin  in  Hypericum  perforatum,  the  ANN  technique  -  multi-layer 
perceptron  (MLP)  had  an  advantage  over  radial  basis  function  (RBF) 
and support vector machine (SVM) in varied ecological and phenolog-
ical conditions of habitat with 87, 80 and 54% accuracy, respectively. 
Hence, we too used the ANN techniques and growing degree days (GDD) 
data (temperature as the most important ecological variable) to reduce

(IoT) and a Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) algorithm based on 
environmental  parameters  (temperature,  rainfall,  humidity  and  wind 
speed)  for  whitefly  prediction.  Shang  and  Zhu  (2021)  have  also  pro-
posed  a  prediction  model  that  combines  the  genetic  algorithm  and 
machine learning algorithms- ANN - to forecast the occurrence of insect 
pests.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that Shang and Zhu (2021) proposed a prediction model that combines the genetic algorithm and machine learning algorithms, including ANN, to forecast the occurrence of insect pests. The use of a genetic algorithm suggests that they may have employed some form of optimization strategy to tune the hyperparameters of their model. Grid search and random search are common methods for hyperparameter tuning, but without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine which method was used in this case.
