to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

this issue, the state Xk vector of the optimized KF is defined in Eq. (8) and 
the  measurement  vector  Zk  is  given  by  Eq.  (9),  where  k  denotes  a 
moment in a given period. Deep SORT, which takes Q and R as functions 
of  estimated  elements  and  metrics,  generates  a  time-dependent  sum. 
Alternations in the state vector of the improved KF require a constant 
correction  of  the  process  noise  covariance  Qk  and  the  measurement 
noise covariance Rk, as given in Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively:

The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (DollÂ´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, we do see references to certain aspects of the model architecture and its components. For instance, the text mentions the use of YOLOv7 as the baseline model, which incorporates Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), cascade-based modeling, model scaling, and model reparameterization. Additionally, the Kalman Filter (KF) is utilized for tracking purposes, with the state Xk vector and measurement vector Zk being defined in equations (8) and (9), respectively. Furthermore, the process noise covariance Qk and measurement noise covariance Rk are adjusted according to alternations in the state vector of the improved KF, as described in equations (10) and (11). Despite these details, without further information regarding the implementation of the deep learning model, it remains unclear what specific hyperparameters were chosen during the development and optimization processes.
