Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  order  to  train  the  model,  it  is important to provide not only 
the  class  of  the  object  but  also  the  bounding  box  data  of  the 
object  as  correct  answer.  In  this  context,  we  parsed  the  x,  y 
coordinates, width and height of the fish in the annotation of the 
imageâ€™s  dataset.  In  addition,  we  used  data  augmentation  to 
extend the amount of data. 

The  model  has  better  performance  as  number  of  epochs 
increases.  However,  when  number  of  epochs  exceeds  200,  the 
network  seems  to  be  overfitted  to  training  data.  As  a  result, 
Table  I  shows  the  hyper-parameters  used  to  train  and  validate 
the Yolo model.

The graph illustrates the loss while training the neural network 
and the average loss is reduced to 0.54%. That means the model 
is  affected  by  training  data.  A  total  of  4000  iteration  were  run 
and  it  took  14  hours  to  complete  the  training.  The  model 
improved swiftly in terms of precision, recall and mean average 
precision  before  plateauing  after  about  1000  iterations,  and 
around 1000 iterations the loss showed a rapid decline. 

For  each  epoch,  64  images  are  randomly  selected  and  used  to 
train  the  model.  Each  image  is  used  multiple  times  due  to  the 
limited  number  of  samples.  Figure  8,  shows  some  training 
samples, and the number zero indicates the fish class.

The data augmentation technique was used in this study, which 
help  to  extend  the  amount  of  information  by  adding  adjusted 
copies of already existing data, and it acts as a  regularizer and 
makes  a  difference  to  reduce  the  overfitting.  While  training, 
before input into the model, each image was randomly sampled 
by  one  of  the  following  options;  the  entire  original  image, 
horizontal  flip,  grayscale,  blur,  noise  and  cropping.  So,  each 
image  was  horizontally  flipped,  grayscale  was  applied  to  25% 
of images, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, 
and for the cropping operation, a patch with the same size as the 
original  image  was  randomly  cropped  from  image.  Some 
examples of the data augmentation step are illustrated in Figure 
3.

Furthermore,  YOLOv3  has  been  made  with  another 
improvement,  the  new  CNN  feature  extractor  named  Darknet-
53. It is a 53 layered CNN that uses 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional 
layers. It has demonstrated the advanced accuracy but with less 
floating-point  tasks  and  better  speed.  For  example,  it  has  less 
the  same 
floating-point  operations 
performance at a double speed. It utilizes also skip connections 
network inspired from ResNet.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as the Yolo model mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include providing not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as the correct answer. This involves parsing the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the object in the annotation of the image's dataset. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can be employed to increase the amount of available data. Data augmentation helps to extend the amount of information by adding adjusted copies of already existing data, acting as a regularizer and reducing overfitting. Before inputting the images into the model, they can be randomly sampled using various transformations like horizontal flip, grayscale conversion, blurring, adding noise, or cropping. Furthermore, selecting appropriate hyperparameters for training and validation is crucial. In the given context, the table presents the hyperparameters used to train and validate the Yolo model, including the number of iterations, epochs, learning rate, batch size, and subdivisions.
