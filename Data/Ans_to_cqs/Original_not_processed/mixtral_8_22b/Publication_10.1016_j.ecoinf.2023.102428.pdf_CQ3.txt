2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

differentiation as a feedforward propagation (FP) algorithm to train the 
neural networks by employing supervised learning based on stochastic 
gradient descent (SGD). Backward pass always improves the efficiency 
of MLP neural networks. Generally, MLP consists of three main layers of 
nodes: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in- 
between them (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). Apart from the input layer,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the dataset with relevant information required for training deep learning models. In the case of this study, since it involves LULC simulation using MLPnn-MC modeling, it can be assumed that some form of image annotation technique might have been used to prepare the dataset for training the MLP neural network. But without explicit mention in the context, we cannot confirm the exact data annotation techniques used in this study.
