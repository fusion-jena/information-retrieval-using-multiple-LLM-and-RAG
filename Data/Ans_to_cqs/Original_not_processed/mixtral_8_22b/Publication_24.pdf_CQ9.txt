%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline used in the paper "CityNet—Deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment" is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined based solely on the provided text. To find out the exact location of the data repository, one would need to refer to the full article or contact the authors directly.

Based on common practices in scientific publications, the data repository could potentially be found on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, without further information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
