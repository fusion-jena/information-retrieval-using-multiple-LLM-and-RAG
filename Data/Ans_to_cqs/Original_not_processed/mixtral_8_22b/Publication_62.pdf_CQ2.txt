Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

included two convolutional layers and two pooling layers (Table 2; https://doi.org/10.6084/
m9.ﬁgshare.5501716). The code used to deﬁne and train these CNNs can be found in our
Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline described in this study uses images as its primary data format. This is evident from the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are specifically designed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Furthermore, the tables detailing the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN both indicate that the input data is a three-dimensional tensor, which is typically associated with RGB images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are primarily images.
