scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

While  still  short  of  having  a  robust  and  standardized  biodiversity 
infrastructure (Heberling et al., 2021), there is great diversity of online 
repositories with taxonomic information and species occurrences data. 
Among  the most  important databases  hosting marine information are 
FishBase,  a  platform  that  hosts  information  on  the  taxonomy  of  fish, 
their ecology, trophic information, habitat, and history of uses dating 
back to more than 250 years (Froese and Pauly, 2000); and the Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a platform that stores and al-
lows for the free access to species occurrence records from around the 
world.  GBIF  is  currently  one  of  the  repositories  hosting  the  largest 
amount of such data in the world (GBIF: The Global Biodiversity Infor-
mation Facility, 2021; Telenius, 2011); and finally Ocean Biodiversity 
Information System (OBIS), which houses data on the occurrence and

due  to  significant  progresses  in  ecoinformatics  (Lenoir  et  al.,  2020; 
Oliver et al., 2021). These databases harbor a growing variety of sources, 
including  museum  specimens,  field  observations,  acoustic  and  visual 
sensors,  and  citizen  science  efforts  (Amano  et  al.,  2016).  However, 
despite the incredible accumulation of biodiversity records, not all the 
data is really useful, nor does it represent new insights into the distri-
bution of species (Bayraktarov et al., 2019; Zizka et al., 2020). That is 
why  a  systematic  evaluation  of  the  integrity  and  coverage  of  this  in-
formation is required (Troia and McManamay, 2017).

Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the datasets being utilized primarily consist of species occurrence records, including taxonomic information and geographical coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude). This suggests that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely structured textual data, possibly in a tabular format like CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

The context mentions several databases containing marine information, such as FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. These platforms store various types of data related to marine life, including taxonomy, ecological information, and historical records. While some of these databases may contain multimedia files like images or videos, the focus of the context seems to be on the use of structured textual data rather than other formats like images, audio, or video.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is structured textual data, potentially in a tabular format like CSV or Excel spreadsheets.
