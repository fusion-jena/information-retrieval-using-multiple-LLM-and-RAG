ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study can be found here: https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf. This repository contains an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset, which was used in this research to extract common objects below the skyline in landscape photos. The authors did not retrain the model on their own data but instead used it as is to infer the presence of these objects in their images.
