C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and  DenseNet-
121, were all trained on this data. All architectures were pre-
initialized  to  ImageNet  weights.  Initially,  the  models  were 
trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the 
classification layers only. However, better results where the F1-
score  improved  by  about  20-30%,  were  obtained  when  both 
feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were 
configured to be trainable. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
was  used  as  the  optimizer  for  all  four  models.  Other  hyper-
parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs 
were  obtained  using  the  grid  search.    The  models  were 
implemented  using  Keras  (https://keras.io/).  The  resulting 
hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II.

I.  INTRODUCTION

Abstract— Maintaining biodiversity is a key component of the 
United Nations (UN) “Life on Land” sustainability goal. Remote 
camera traps monitoring animals’ movements support research in 
biodiversity.  However,  images  from  these  camera  traps  are 
currently labeled manually resulting in high processing costs and 
long  delays.  This  paper  proposes  an  IoT-based  system  that 
leverages deep learning and edge computing to automatically label 
camera trap images and transmit this information to scientists in 
a  timely  manner.  Inception-V3,  MobileNet-V2,  ResNet-18,  and 
DenseNet-121  were  trained  on  data  consisting  of  33,984  images 
taken  during  day  and  night  with  6  animal  classes.  Inception-V3 
yielded  the  highest  macro  average  F1-score  of  0.93  and  an 
accuracy  of  94%.  An  IoT-based  system  was  developed  that 
directly captures images from a commercial camera trap, does the 
inference on the edge using a Raspberry Pi (RPi), and sends the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline consists of 33,984 images taken during day and night with six animal classes. No specific names or details regarding the dataset have been mentioned apart from this description. Therefore, it cannot be directly compared to popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
