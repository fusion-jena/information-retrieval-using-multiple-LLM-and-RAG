80 cm), and 78% of measurements were expected to be low (i.e., less 
than 50 cm). This may indicate that permafrost in the Siksik Creek Basin 
has experienced less  thaw than elsewhere in the broader Trail Valley 
Creek area or that the boundaries based on ALT for Trail Valley Creek 
are not as representative of the Siksik Creek Basin.

most influential; conditional probabilities can also be learned from al-
gorithms,  such  as  the  Lauritzen  –  Spiegelhalter  algorithm  or  Gibbs 
sampling  (Chen  and  Pollino,  2012).  Finally,  the  inclusion  of  decision 
nodes can limit the tools and algorithms available for use in the GeNIe 
software  program.  The  inclusion  of  decision  nodes  results  in  the  BN 
being classified as an “influence diagram,” and some tools, such as the 
“sensitivity  analysis”  tool,  are  unavailable  for  use  with  influence  dia-
grams within the software. The decision nodes would either need to be 
removed or converted to chance nodes prior to running these tools in 
GeNIe.
