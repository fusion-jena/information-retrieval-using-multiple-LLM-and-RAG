comprehensive datasets and in-depth research employing machine and 
deep  learning  techniques.  These  challenges  stem  from  the  need  to

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of deep learning techniques for predicting oil palm crop yields, which suggests that the data could be related to agricultural factors such as climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer use, and seed varieties. Given this information, possible data formats include structured data like CSV files containing numerical values representing these factors, or even satellite imagery if remote sensing data were incorporated. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, we cannot definitively state the exact data format(s) utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
