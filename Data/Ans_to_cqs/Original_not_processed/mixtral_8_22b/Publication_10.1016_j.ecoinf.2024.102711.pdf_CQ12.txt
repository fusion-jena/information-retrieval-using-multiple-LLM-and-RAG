2.5. Automated machine learning (AutoML) 

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed. 

2.5.1. AutoGluon

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

We used four ML model types in our research as described here. Two

2.5.1. AutoGluon 

AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML library designed to democra-
tize machine learning, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. It 
simplifies  the  process  of  training  high-performance  ML  models  on 
structured  data  with  minimal  code.  The  approach  behind  AutoGluon 
emphasizes  advanced  data  processing,  deep  learning,  and  ensemble 
techniques,  rather  than  just  algorithm  selection  and  hyperparameter 
tuning.  It  automates  feature  engineering,  data  pre-processing,  model 
training,  and  ensembling,  utilizing  methods  like  multi-layer  stacking 
and  neural  network  embeddings.  The  core  training  strategy  of  Auto-
Gluon can be summarized in the following steps:  

(1)  AutoGluon trains a collection of ML models M = (m1, m2, …, mn) 
on the training data, including neural networks, tree ensembles, 
and more.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the AutoGluon pipeline. However, it does state that AutoGluon includes neural networks among its trained models. Neural networks can refer to various architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the AutoGluon pipeline.
