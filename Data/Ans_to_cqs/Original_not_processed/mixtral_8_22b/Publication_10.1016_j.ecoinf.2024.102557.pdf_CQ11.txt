resolution at the landscape scale. To achieve this, we use predictive models based on machine learning algo-
rithms and a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 
years. We estimate that current and future productivity patterns differ among species, under different climate 
change scenarios and bioclimatic regions. Our results suggest that optimal productivity areas may be shifted to 
higher  elevations,  making  those  species  with  higher  productivity  at  higher  elevations  the  most  affected  by 
climate change. This would mean that some species with high socioeconomic value, such as Lactarius deliciosus 
and Boletus edulis, could be negatively affected in their total productivity in the study area. This study highlights 
the need to anticipate the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity and in particular on high

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The given references do not explicitly mention any specific links to repositories containing the deep learning pipeline used for studying Mediterranean forest ecosystems and fungal productivity. However, it can be suggested to look into the authors' personal websites, institutional databases, or contact them directly for further information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline and related datasets.
