For this vector e, the following cost function is determined: 

cost(W) = eT e = (Y (cid:0) XW *)T (Y (cid:0) XW *)

Thus, it can be shown that the derivative of the function (6) with 

respect to the weight vector W is:

= (cid:0) 2XT Y + 2XT XW.

Now, by equating formula (7) to zero, it is possible to determine the

3. Materials and methods 

This section presents the tools and statistical models used to analyse 
the dependencies in this article. The first tool that was helpful in pre- 
processing  the  data  was  standardization  (Williamson  and  Piattoeva, 
2019). This is a kind of normalization that allows changing the scope of 
individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical 
range. It should be emphasized here that this transformation preserves 
the distance relations between individual data. Thus, suppose one have a 
set of records xj ∈ ℝn, j = 1, …, m where n is the number of features. For 
each element j = 1, …, m, the variables are transformed as follows:

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

Helpful Answer:

In this investigation, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). OLS belongs to the set of LSE optimizers and is used to minimize the sum of squared residuals. In this method, the difference between the measured data and the estimated vector of weights is calculated. Then, a cost function is determined for this vector, which is minimized to find the optimal weights. The derivative of the cost function with respect to the weight vector is then calculated and set equal to zero to determine the coefficients satisfying the equation. This method is described briefly in the given context, but more details can be found in Uyank and Guler (2013). Other optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are not mentioned in the provided context.
