with 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 neurons 
each, all using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function; for 
the output layer we used the sigmoid activation function. We used the 
LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNN’s 
architecture  previously  described.  The  implementation  of  the  classifi-
cation methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow 
and Scikit-learn (Van Rossum and Drake Jr, 1995). Finally, we obtained 
the accuracy, true positive rate and false positive rate using the afore-
mentioned training-test splits of the time series.

Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates 
in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information available, we can infer that the input data might be numerical or categorical since the paper mentions using the ReLU activation function, which is commonly used for numerical inputs. Additionally, the paper uses the sigmoid activation function for the output layer, suggesting binary classification tasks. Therefore, the data could potentially be in a structured format like CSV. However, without explicit confirmation from the authors, this remains speculative.
