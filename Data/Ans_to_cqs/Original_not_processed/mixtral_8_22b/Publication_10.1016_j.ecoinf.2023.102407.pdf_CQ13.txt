et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacherâ€“student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. It only mentions that the hyperparameters were set up as in Bean et al. (2012), but it doesn't provide details about what those hyperparameters are. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the given context.
