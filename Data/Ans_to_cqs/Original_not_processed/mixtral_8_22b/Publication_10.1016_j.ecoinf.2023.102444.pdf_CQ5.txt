To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

2.2. Bioclimatic variables 

Bioclimatic variables, representing the ecological conditions for the 
environment and species locations, were extracted from raster layers at a 
global  level.  These  layers  were  downloaded  from  wordclim  v2.1  at  a 
resolution  of  2.5  min  (https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html). 
The  19  layers  represented  near  current  bioclimatic  conditions 
(1970–2000),  derived  from  temperature  and  precipitation,  and  are 
commonly used in SDM (Fick and Hijmans, 2017) (Table S1 in supple-
mentary material).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study focuses on using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for estimating species distributions based on bioclimatic variables. The authors claim that their approach is novel compared to other studies which use Deep Learning Models (DLMs) and apply techniques like tSNE (another DRM) to visualize input data and results from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for modeling species distribution at a fine resolution. In this case, the datasets used would likely be related to bioclimatic variables and species location data rather than traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
