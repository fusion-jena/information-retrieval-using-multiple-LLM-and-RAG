2.2.1. High spatial resolution satellite image data

Zhou et al. (2018) used homogeneous and pure pixel filter methods and 
pixel unmixing methods to select high-quality LAI training samples from 
MODIS products and used the support vector machine (SVR) algorithm 
to estimate high spatial resolution LAI. These studies prove that select-
ing  high-quality  LAI  products  from  global  LAI  products  as  training 
samples for empirical models is feasible.

For machine learning methods such as RF models, the quality of the 
training samples can seriously affect their prediction results. Although 
this study utilised the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to 
eliminate  cloud-contaminated  and  poor-quality  pixels  and  to  remove 
outliers  from  the  training  samples,  the  surface  of  the  study  area  was 
highly heterogeneous compared to that of Zhai et al. (2020). To ensure 
that a sufficient number of LAI training samples could be selected, the 
main  algorithm  saturated  the  pixels  during  the  selection  of  the  LAI 
training  samples,  but  this  increased  the  high-value  LAI  uncertainty 
(Kang  et  al.,  2021).  Jamali  et  al.  (2023)  used  a  variety  of  machine 
learning  algorithms  to  estimate  various  leaf  parameters  for  wheat 
leaves, concluding that deep neural networks were the most capable of 
improving the prediction accuracy of leaf parameters. Therefore, field

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data, which suggests that the data format used might be related to imagery or remote sensing data. In particular, the study uses MODIS products and Landsat data, both of which provide satellite imagery data. Additionally, the study discusses using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) models, which typically work with structured data formats like CSV files containing numerical features. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state whether the input data consists solely of image data or if other formats like CSV files are also utilized.
