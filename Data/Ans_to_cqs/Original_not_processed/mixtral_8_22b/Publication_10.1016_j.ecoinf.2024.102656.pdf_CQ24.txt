To address potential spatial bias in sampling, global Moran's I anal-
ysis was conducted in ArcGIS 10.7 (Fig. S1). The results, presented in 
Fig. S1, indicated no spatial correlation among the occurrence points, 
affirming the reliability of the dataset. Furthermore, to mitigate spatial 
autocorrelation, all multiple and duplicate occurrences within a mini-
mum  distance  of  3  km  were  excluded  from  the  dataset,  ensuring  the 
integrity  and  representativeness  of  species  occurrence  records. 
Following the spatial filtering process, we retained a total of 110, 105, 
and  100  presence  points  for  wild  goat,  urial,  and  jebeer  gazelle, 
respectively, in the final dataset employed for habitat modelling.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided sources directly discuss this topic. Therefore, based solely on these sources, it is not possible to provide a specific strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values.

However, generally speaking, there are several common strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, employing ensemble methods, and utilizing regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Setting fixed seeds ensures consistent results across different runs of the same model, while cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by training and testing the model on different subsets of data. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce variance, while regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training.
