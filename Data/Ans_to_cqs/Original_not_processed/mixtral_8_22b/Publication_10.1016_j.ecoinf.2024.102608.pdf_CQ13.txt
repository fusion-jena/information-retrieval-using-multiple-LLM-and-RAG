we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

3.3. Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation of machine 
learning models 

We developed machine learning models to predict CHL-a, SD, and 
TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 
OLI  imagery.  To  optimize  the  performance  of  these  models,  we  con-
ducted hyperparameter tuning. The optimal hyperparameter values for 
each machine learning model were determined using a randomized grid 
search  (Bergstra and  Bengio, 2012; Lee et  al., 2022). It is  a  powerful 
optimization  technique  that  differs  from  traditional  grid  search  by

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several machine learning models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict CHL-a, SD, and TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI imagery. However, only ANN is considered a type of deep learning model. For the ANN model, the hyperparameters used include hidden layer sizes, activation function, solver, alpha, and learning rate. Unfortunately, the specific values for these hyperparameters are not mentioned in the given context.

Unhelpful Answer:
The study does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
