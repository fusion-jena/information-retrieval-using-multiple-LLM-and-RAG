on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

(GAM)  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2003),  machine  learning  methods  such  as 
Random  Forests  (RF)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019),  Boosted  Regression  Trees 
(BRT) (Hellegers et al., 2020) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) (Phillips 
et al., 2006) are gaining popularity. Among these, Maxent, which uses 
only presence data, has become a widely used SDM because of its su-
perior predictive ability (Wisz et al., 2008), particularly given the dif-
ficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

accurately  reflect  the  efficacy  of  bias  correction  (Amaro  et  al.,  2023; 
Redding et al., 2017).

Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 illustrated the bias correction effect ΔD value and 
the average ranking of 100 virtual SDMs across various presence sample 
sizes and bias types for different bias correction methods. Regarding OS 
bias, the aggregation background method outperformed other methods 
when  the  presence  sample  size  n  is  ≤70  and  ranks  second  only  to 
geographic filtering when n > 70. Regarding RD bias, the aggregation 
background  method  outperformed  other  methods  when  n  ≤ 50  and 
ranks second only to geographic filtering or the similarity background 
method when n > 70.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques help adjust the parameters of the model during training to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of predictions. Other popular optimization techniques include Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and AdaGrad. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors like the complexity of the problem, computational resources available, and desired convergence speed.

The text primarily focuses on the use of machine learning methods such as Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) in species distribution modeling (SDM). It also discusses the performance of different bias correction methods under varying presence sample sizes and bias types. Unfortunately, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
