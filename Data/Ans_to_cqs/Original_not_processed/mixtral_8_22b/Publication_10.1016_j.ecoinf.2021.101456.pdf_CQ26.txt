dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

The  quality  of  the  auto-encoded  reconstructions  is  controlled  by  the 
reconstruction loss ℒrec, which is the first term in Eq. (1). The encoder 
density is regularized to match the prior over the latent variable, p(z) ∼
𝒩 (0bf,I), enforced by the regularization loss, ℒreg, which is the Kullback- 
Leibler divergence (KLD) term in Eq. (1). At a high level, the regulari-
zation term controls the smoothness or the regularity of the latent space. 
Well structured and smooth latent spaces can yield useful representa-
tions of the input data.

Fig. 1, and since a higher β term favours a well generalised latent space 
over good reconstructions, a reduction in clustering performance could 
be expected. Additionally, the non-adaptive VAE was more cumbersome 
to train as the model collapsed frequently during training.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the information available.

In the context, it mentions that the dataset was gradually expanded until reconstructions were sufficiently good. This implies that the dataset might have been imbalanced initially, and expanding the dataset could help mitigate this issue. Expansion of the dataset could involve collecting more diverse data or using augmentation techniques like oversampling minority classes or undersampling majority classes.

Additionally, the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) suggests another way to potentially handle data bias. By limiting the size of the bottleneck of the model (latent dimension) to two, they aim to visualize the latent representation. A well-structured and smooth latent space can yield useful representations of the input data. This process may inherently reduce biases present in the original data by transforming them into a more balanced and representative latent space.

However, without explicit details about the preprocessing steps taken to address data bias, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of techniques used for handling data bias in this particular case.
