on identifying a complete set of environmental parameters related to the 
species’  subsistence  (Pearson,  2007).  Therefore,  parameter  selection 
methods are often used before ENMs (Bargain et al., 2017; Coro et al., 
2013a;  Coro  et  al.,  2015b;  Coro  et  al.,  2015c;  Guo  and  Liu,  2010; 
Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019;  Muscarella  et  al.,  2014;  S´anchez-Tapia  et  al., 
2017; Schnase et al., 2021; Warren and Seifert, 2011; Zeng et al., 2016). 
ENMs use statistical analysis, machine learning, or expert-defined rules 
to  estimate  the  species’  ecological  niche  as  a  predictive  function  be-
tween  habitat  suitability  conditions  and  the  input  environmental  pa-
rameters.  One  input  to  an  ENM  is,  therefore,  a  set  of  environmental 
parameters related to species’  subsistence in the analysis area, homo-
geneously defined on the area at a specific spatial resolution (Alvera- 
Azc´arate et al., 2005; Durand et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2008; Peterson,

Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. Typically, around 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-40% is divided between testing and validation. The exact ratio depends on factors like the total amount of available data and the complexity of the problem being addressed.

In some cases, stratified sampling may also be employed when splitting the data. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same class proportions as the original dataset. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, which contain significantly more instances from one class compared to others.

Additionally, time series data might require different strategies for splitting the data, such as using a rolling window or expanding window method, due to temporal dependencies within the data.

However, without further information regarding the specific application or dataset mentioned in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer about the criteria used to split the data for this particular case.
