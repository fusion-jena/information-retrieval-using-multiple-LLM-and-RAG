data  can  be  implemented  using  the  encoded  information  of  the 
autoencoder, which concentrates the latent information of the original 
data  (Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Zabalza  et  al.,  2016).  Convolutional  neural 
networks (CNN) are deep learning architectures that have demonstrated 
outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data (Chaddad 
et al., 2021; Gupta and Bag, 2022; Ren et al., 2017). The CNN model has 
been successfully applied to the estimation of variables in aquatic en-
vironments,  such  as  water  quality  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022),  streamflow 
(Hussain  et  al.,  2020),  and  algae  (Cao  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  deep 
learning algorithms are suitable applications for sustainably estimating 
aquatic ecosystem health. Only one previous study applied a CNN-based 
approach, not to classify health levels but to augment aquatic ecosystem 
health data (Lee et al., 2021). Consequently, the deep learning fusion

Looking beyond these data to improve the extensibility of investigations 
on the health of aquatic ecosystems is necessary (Upadhyay and Khan-
delwal,  2019;  Yuan  et  al.,  2017).  Deep  learning  techniques  have  the 
potential to be used to investigate parts of ecosystems. In this study, the 
TDI, BMI, and FAI were calculated using ecological monitoring data, and 
the status of the aquatic ecosystem was determined. Quantitative and 
qualitative  indices  may  constrain  further  applications,  such  as  grade 
prediction of aquatic ecosystem health. However, we demonstrated that 
the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is a potential candidate 
for  estimating  aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  compared  with  the 
original CNN and conventional machine learning models (Table 3). In 
other  words,  deep  learning  methods  can  be  applied  to  water  quality, 
hydraulic, and hydrological data to reflect the quantitative and quali-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does discuss various aspects of applying deep learning techniques to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. It mentions that the autoencoder generates new features from time series and static data related to the aquatic ecosystem. This suggests that the raw data could include temporal and spatial measurements collected through various means like remote sensing, satellite imagery, or ground-level sensor readings. Additionally, the context refers to ecological monitoring data being used to calculate indicators like TDI, BMI, and FAI, implying that field observations and sampling might also contribute to the dataset. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the data collection process, it remains uncertain what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
