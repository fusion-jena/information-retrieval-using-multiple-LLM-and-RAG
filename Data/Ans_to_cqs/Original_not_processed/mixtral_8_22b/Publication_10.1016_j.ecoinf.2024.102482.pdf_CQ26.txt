Recently,  there  have  been  remarkable  advancements  in  applying 
deep learning technology to predict water quality parameters, such as 
BOD, COD, pH, and temperature, using data collected over an extended 
period (Khullar and Singh, 2022; Prasad et al., 2021; Wai et al., 2022; 
Zheng et al., 2023). However, when it comes to applying biomonitoring 
data for water quality pollution detection, finding relevant cases is still

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. This technique ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced class distributions. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources or demographics to ensure that the dataset represents different perspectives and reduces bias. This technique can be particularly useful in applications where fairness and inclusivity are important considerations.

In summary, several techniques can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. However, the choice of technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the application requirements.
