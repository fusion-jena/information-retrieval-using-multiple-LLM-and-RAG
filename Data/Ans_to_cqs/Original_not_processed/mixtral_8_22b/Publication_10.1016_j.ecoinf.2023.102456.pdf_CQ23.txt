However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to 

̃
Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, based on the table presented, it appears that the authors evaluated the performance of their model across various partitions and values of parameter 'C'. This approach is similar to k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into 'k' subsets or folds, and the model is trained and tested on each fold iteratively. By doing so, the authors could assess the robustness and stability of their model across different subsets of the dataset. Additionally, they used multiple evaluation metrics such as False Positive Rate (FP), True Negative Rate (TNR), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to evaluate the performance of their model comprehensively. These measures suggest that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
