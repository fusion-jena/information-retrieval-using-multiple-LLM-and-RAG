Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

the  feature  information,  leaving  the  other  half  unprocessed.  The  un-
processed half is directly concatenated with the post-processed features. 
To  avoid  information  loss  and  extract  more  complete  information

regulation. We set the batch size of all networks to 16 uniformly.

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that the batch size was set to 16 uniformly across all networks. In general, when splitting data for deep learning models, common practices include randomly dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set evaluates its performance. The validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the dataset size and problem requirements but often ranges from 70-80% for training, 10-15% for testing, and 10-15% for validation.
