Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python libraryâ€™s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

Individual machine learning models address large datasets and dy-
namic water quality data well but are commonly overfit. Researchers 
have employed model to address this issue. Combining weak learners 
reduces overfitting and strengthens the prediction model (Mosavi et al., 
2020). Adedeji et al., 2022 predicted stream water quality using SVM, 
RF,  XGB,  ensemble  RF-XGB,  and  ANN  models.  Panahi  et  al.  (2022) 
predicted stream flow and water quality with data pre-processing based 
on  an  ensemble  bagging  technique  combined  with  the  SVM  model. 
(Haghiabi et al., 2018) analyzed various aspects of water quality in the 
Tireh River in Iran, employing models based on ANN, group method of 
data handling (GMDH), and SVM. Among these models, the SVM model 
utilizing  the  radial  bias  function  demonstrated  outstanding  perfor-
mance,  highlighting  its  effectiveness  in  accurately  predicting  water

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of water quality parameters (WQP) including conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO. It also states that the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation for model evaluation and hyperparameter selection. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset used in this case is related to water quality parameters and not any of the common deep learning datasets mentioned in the query.
