Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.1 Data Preprocessing

The choice of learning data is a crucial point. We worked with biology experts
of the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos. We cropped some frames of
the videos and created a training database composed of 13000 ﬁsh thumbnails.
The thumbnail size varies from a minimum of 20 × 40 pixels to a maximum of
150 × 200 pixels. Each thumbnail contains only one labeled-ﬁsh as shown on
Fig. 2.

We decided to keep only the species with more than 450 thumbnails. We also
widen the database by applying rotations and symmetries in order to capture
all the possible position of the ﬁshes. Table 1 lists the retained species.

Due to the highly textured natural background, we also added a class for the
background. This class is constituted with random thumbnails of the background
which were randomly selected in frames and speciﬁc background thumbnails
which were taken around the ﬁsh thumbnails.

After processing all the resolutions of a frame, we obtain a list of bounding
boxes, and for each bounding box a probability of belonging to a class. Yet
the classiﬁcation remains ambiguous if there is more than one bounding box
corresponding to the same potential ﬁsh (see Fig. 5).

To suppress the redundant bounding boxes, we ﬁrst keep the boxes whose
probabilities are above a given probability threshold T (T = 98 %) in the case
of Fig. 5. So if the motion score is greater than our motion threshold and the
probabilities to belong to a class of ﬁsh is greater than 98 %, we keep the box.
Then, we fuse the remaining boxes following based on the following properties:

that two ﬁshes in the center are not displayed because they do not belong to one of
the species which have been learned.

To be able to do multi-resolution classiﬁcation, all the background thumbnails

were taken with random dimensions, from 40 × 60 pixels to 400 × 500 pixels.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the authors may use common machine learning practices such as monitoring the validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process once the model performance has reached a satisfactory level or stopped improving significantly. It is important to note that this information is not directly stated in the provided context, so further clarification would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
