Fig. 3. Generated ground-truth. Ground-truth required for the training phase is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific 
deep learning model PCθ  being employed:: (i) bounding boxes are generated by creating squares centered over the dots with a fixed side length s, (ii) density maps are 
produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels Gσ  centered at the dot positions, and (iii) segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs having 
radius r and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. The parameters s, σ, and r are constants that are established based on the standard object sizes 
prevalent in the images. Best viewed in electronic format.

we break them down into smaller patches. Specifically, in the training 
stage,  we  randomly  crop  square  patches  (experimenting  with  various 
patch sizes, namely 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels), and we apply a 
simple  augmentation  strategy,  flipping  the  patches  horizontally  and 
vertically with a 50% probability. On the other hand, during the vali-
dation phase, we divide the images of the validation split into regularly- 
spaced,  overlapping  patches,  using  the  same  size  employed  during 
training.  We  process  these  patches  individually,  reconstructing  the 
overall  output  by  combining  the  predictions  from  the  patches,  and 
subsequently, we calculate metrics over the complete image. For clarity, 
Fig.  2  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  this  procedure.  In  more 
detail,  for  the  solution  based  on  detection,  we  reconstruct  the  final 
global  output  using  non-maximum  suppression  among  the  bounding

training step  and  a test  split  with the  remaining eight images  for the 
model evaluation phase. Finally, it is worth noting that, even if we an-
notated only the pests belonging to the class “whitefly”, other insects 
were accidentally stucked in the traps, which represents an additional 
challenge  -  deep  learning  models  should  not  count  the  latter  insect 
species. Specifically, we found insects belonging to different orders, such 
as  Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera,  and  Diptera  (about  21,  7,  and  113, 
respectively);  furthermore,  among  hemipterans  we  also  found  insects 
belonging to families of Psyllidae, Aphidae, and Miridae (about 4, 14, 
and  22,  respectively).  Besides, about  80% of  the  images contain  con-
taminants,  such  as  dust,  fluff,  or  leaves,  accidentally  glued  over  the 
sticky traps. Some samples of bycatches insects and contaminants can be 
found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information regarding general preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions several preprocessing steps specific to generating ground truth data for training deep learning models. These include generating bounding boxes, density maps, and segmentation maps from dot labels. Bounding boxes are created by centering squares over the dots with a fixed side length's'. Density maps are produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels centered at the dot positions, while segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs with radius 'r', splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. Parameters's', 'σ', and 'r' are constants determined based on typical object sizes prevalent in the images. Additionally, the text describes dividing images into smaller patches during both training and validation stages. During training, random cropping of square patches of varying sizes is performed along with simple augmentation strategies like horizontal and vertical flipping with a 50% probability. During validation, images are divided into regularly spaced, overlapping patches of the same size used in training. These patches are processed individually, and their outputs combined to form the overall prediction.
