is training and storing models using an interface provided by the site and 
its computational resources.

derived.  

2.  STARdbi_train 

Input: 
The output directory of STARdbi_split_images, as described above, 
Output: 
A classification model (ResNet152, He et al. (2015)) in the form of a 

binary pickle file.  

3.  STARdbi_inference 

Input:  

I.  A directory with unannotated single-insect image files, with the 
same  naming  convention  as  described  in  the  output  of 
STARdbi_split_images.

4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  usersâ€™  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

2.5. Automatic insect classification 

Automatic,  AI-based,  insect  classification  is  not  yet  part  of  the 
STARdbi pipeline. Users may download images and their box annota-
tions (as Comma Separated Values, csv, files), train models locally, and 
apply them to unlabeled data. The programs that we applied to this end 
(case study 1 in the Results section) are available in the STARdbi web- 
site as a Google Colab notebook. We also welcome collaborations with 
other researchers, in which our team will take the role of designing and 
trouble-shooting classification models to meet specific needs. 

The available programs for the generation of classification models 

include:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that the dataset might have been divided randomly into these subsets. Typically, the division ratio could be around 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This distribution allows the model to learn from most of the data while reserving some portions for evaluating its performance during training and after completion. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the splitting process, one cannot provide a definitive answer.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I do not know what criteria were used to divide the dataset into different subsets like train, test, or validation.
