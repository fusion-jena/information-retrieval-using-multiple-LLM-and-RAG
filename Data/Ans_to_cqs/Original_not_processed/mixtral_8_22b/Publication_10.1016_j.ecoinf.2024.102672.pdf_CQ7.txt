In order to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters while 
avoiding the risk of over-fitting the models, we performed k-fold cross- 
validation. In this method the training set is split into k fractions, each 
one being used iteratively as a validation set, while the remaining k-1 
fractions  are  used as  training set. Therefore,  the validation  process  is 
performed k folds or times, with a different validation set each time. In 
all the models the first 4 years (2018-2021) were used as training set 
while the last year (2022) was used as test set, thus meaning a propor-
tion of approximately 80â€“20%, which is a common rule in ML. Given 
this data structure, it was found to be consistent to choose a value of k 
equal to 4, so that each validation fraction corresponds approximately to 
one year.

Table 2 contains the best set of hyperparameters found for each set of 
variables,  together  with  the  results  from  the  training  on  the  whole 
training data set and test on unseen data. During the cross-validation 
process,  there  were  no  discrepancies  among  the  three  metrics  used. 
Generally, the best model for each set of variables was optimal regarding 
the three metrics or the differences were <1%. In case of these small 
discrepancies, the model with the highest AUC was chosen. The first row 
in Table 2, represented as t in the column of variables, contains the re-
sults of the model with only variables that are contemporaneous with 
the target. The row represented as + t-1 contains the variables in t and 
the 1-day lagged variables, and so on in the following rows. The number 
of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guar-
anteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross- 
validation.

Opposite to other families of ML models that have a narrow range of 
hyperparameters  to  adjust,  ANN  are  defined  by  different  types  of 
hyperparameters,  which  together  with  the  computational  cost  of 
training deep ANN, restricts the options to optimize. On the one hand, 
we have the hyperparameters that define the architecture of the ANN 
(number of layers and number of neurons), while on the other hand we 
have the hyperparameters that control de training process (mainly the 
learning rate, the optimizer, the batch size and the number of epochs 
that the training lasts). In order to avoid an exhaustive search that could 
consume a lot of time, a small dimensional space was initially defined 
and  explored  with  the  original variables.  The initial  hyperparameters 
that composed this space are shown in Table 1. The number of epochs 
was maintained in 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the

The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new cate-
gorical binary variable that stored the existence of stratification or not 
(took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it 
was stratified).

Helpful Answer:
To split the data for deep learning model training, the authors employed k-fold cross-validation. This method involves dividing the training set into 'k' fractions, where each fraction serves as a validation set iteratively, while the remaining 'k-1' fractions form the training set. Consequently, the validation process occurs 'k' times, using a distinct validation set each time. For all models, the first four years (2018-2021) were utilized as the training set, whereas the final year (2022) functioned as the test set. This resulted in an approximate proportion of 80-20%, a typical ratio in machine learning applications. Considering the data structure, choosing a value of 'k' equal to 4 was deemed appropriate, ensuring that each validation fraction corresponded roughly to one year.
