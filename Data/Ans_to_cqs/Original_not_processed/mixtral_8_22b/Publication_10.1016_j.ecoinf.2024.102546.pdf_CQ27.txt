Data  distribution  shifts  are  commonly  encountered  in  deploying 
machine learning systems, manifested as degraded model performance 
(Koh et al., 2021). This is conceivably true for weed recognition models

jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements random crop 
and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly 
with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 
800  × 800  pixels,  which  is  compatible  with  model  architectures  and 
training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of 
each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the 
original image aspect ratio. All models were trained for 40 epochs with 
batch  size  8,  which  could  adequately  converge  based  on  empirical 
observations.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide details regarding the specific steps taken for model serialization or platform selection.
