Cross-validation is an iterative method for calculating the expected
value of a particular measure. It splits the dataset into K equally-sized
parts that are called folds. In each iteration, diﬀerent (K − 1)-folds are
used for training and the remaining fold for testing. The overall mea-
sure of its performance is the average of the measures of the individual
iterations. The above method guarantees that every instance will be
used both for training and testing. There is an alternative of cross-va-
lidation method called stratiﬁed cross-validation, where in each fold a
balanced number of instances for each class is selected. For our ex-
perimentation, we used stratiﬁed cross-validation with K = 10 folds.

4. Experiments

In this section, we perform two experiments. First, we are trying to
predict the existence of seagrass, and then its family. We are also in-
terested on which variables aﬀecting those predictions most.

By determining which variables are most important we can simplify
the analysis of a dataset, better understand the physical concepts of it,
and exclude the ones that confuse the model achieving better accuracy
and learning/testing speed.

There exist several ways to determine variable importance, e.g.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Chi-square, and Regression. We deal
with tree-based variable importance, like (Arthur et al., 2010) did. It

4.1.1. Estimating uncertainty

Since the absence part of our dataset is generated artiﬁcially with
the method described in Section 2.3, it may contain errors introducing
uncertainty in the absolute numbers of the evaluation measures. Let us
do a rough estimation of how large this uncertainty may be.

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. By dropping out these neurons, the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of any single neuron, making it harder for the network to rely too heavily on any one feature.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating potential overfitting. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or noise addition, helping to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
