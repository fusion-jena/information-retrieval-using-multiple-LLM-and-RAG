for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the use of the nine-cell approach for smoothing existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, but does not provide details about any other data augmentation methods such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
