3.1. Dataset curation

2. Public weed dataset survey 

Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic search in major 
databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE 
Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed 
database”,  “agriculture”,  “machine  vision”  and  “computer  vision”. 
Particularly,  to  facilitate searching  via  Google  Scholar,  the  Python  li-
brary “scholarly”3  was employed to automatically retrieve publication 
records. A total of 451 records were collected from the literature search,

the  metadata  (e.g.,  camera,  date,  and  capture  time)  included  in  the 
dataset.  Despite  the  seemingly  large  scale  of  the  dataset,  only  potted 
plants  were  captured  under  controlled  indoor  settings,  restricting  the 
applicability of this dataset in real-world field scenes.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes a combination of methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Initially, a systematic search is conducted in major databases such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv using relevant keywords like "weed dataset", "weed database", "agriculture", "machine vision" and "computer vision". To automate the process, the Python library "scholarly" is used to retrieve publication records. This results in the collection of 451 records from the literature search. Additionally, various publicly available weed datasets are also considered, which include different types of imagery such as RGB, HSI, MSI, Multimodal, and RGB-D. These datasets have varying numbers of images and species, with some containing more than 10,000 images. However, it should be noted that most of these datasets are limited to controlled indoor settings, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios.
