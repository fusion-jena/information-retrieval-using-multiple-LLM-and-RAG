2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

2.2. Data and processing

long-term observations of vegetation dynamics. Around the year 2000, 
the launch of new remote sensing satellites provided advanced datasets. 
These include the SPOT-VGT NDVI dataset (Yang et al., 2015) and the 
MODIS NDVI dataset (Ji et al., 2008), both of which feature enhanced 
temporal and spatial resolutions that significantly improve monitoring 
and analysis. The NDVI datasets provide a comprehensive repository of 
information  that  encapsulates  the  spatial  and  temporal  dynamics  of 
vegetation growth. These datasets are extensively employed in various 
research  applications,  including  ecosystem  assessment  (Tian  et  al., 
2015), the monitoring of consistency in vegetation and climate change 
dynamics (Ghaderpour et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a), as well as in the 
surveillance of land cover and vegetation cover transformations (Hong 
et al., 2023). The variations in satellite orbital parameters, orbital drift,

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks for the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the use of several NDVI datasets in a study related to vegetation dynamics. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query with the provided context. However, I can list the datasets mentioned in the context:

1. 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI)
2. Daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI)
3. Third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI)
4. SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI)
