%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what specific steps were taken for its deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
