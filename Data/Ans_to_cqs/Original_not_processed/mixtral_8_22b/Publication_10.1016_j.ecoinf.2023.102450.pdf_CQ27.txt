All  experiments  were  performed  on  a  personal  computer  with  a 
1060Ti GPU and an Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. Additionally, CUDA 
v10.1 was applied to train the model, which accelerated the processing 
speed; Python version 3.7 was also used. The other libraries used were 
NumPy  (v1.21.2),  PyTorch  (v1.6.0),  Pycocotools,  Cython,  Matplotlib, 
tqdm, yacs, and OpenCV. 

The wild  animals  were tracked  using the  Siamese  network,  which 
updated the connection weights of each network layer by learning the 
features of the training samples. This ensured that the tracking method 
produced  accurate  results(Kang  et  al.,  2019).  In  comparison  with 
traditional training methods, the few-shot learning method can rapidly

train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model from the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide any specific details about the model serialization or platform selection. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, it would be saved or serialized into a format such as.h5,.onnx, or.pb, depending on the framework used. Then, this serialized model could be deployed onto various platforms like cloud services, edge devices, or mobile applications, again depending on the use case and requirements.
