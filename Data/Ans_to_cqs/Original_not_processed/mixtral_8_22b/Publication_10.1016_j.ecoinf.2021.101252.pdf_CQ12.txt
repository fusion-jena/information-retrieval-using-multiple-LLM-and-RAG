Type of architecture and accuracy of candidate models and predictive performance of selected models (bold). The accuracy of candidate models was measured using 
the proportion of correctly classified cases. The accuracy of selected models was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

and  LSTM  recurrent  layers),  ResNet  and  InceptionTime  architectures. 
Specific details about the components and structure of each architecture 
are given in van Kuppevelt et al. (2020).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses several types of deep learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNet), and InceptionTime. These are all different types of neural network architectures designed for specific tasks. For example, CNNs are often used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, while LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, making them suitable for sequential data like time series. ResNet is a type of CNN known for its residual connections which help solve the problem of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Lastly, InceptionTime is a state-of-the-art deep learning model specifically designed for time series classification.
