5.4. Dataset extension

The proposed approach has shown good performance (accuracy) for
cactus recognition in aerial images. One way to improve the current
accuracy could be to make deeper the current CNN, however, im-
proving the accuracy with a deeper network will tend to memorize the
dataset due to the model capacity (Goodfellow et al., 2016), causing
model overﬁtting. A better improvement to the current work is to in-
clude more examples in the dataset. Such examples should be obtained
under diﬀerent conditions, some variations are diﬀerent daylight con-
ditions or diﬀerent year seasons. Diﬀerent season pictures will provide
a distinctive context because the rainy season changes all valley's ve-
getation.

6. Conclusions

images are
available. Under those circumstances, the proposed approach was de-
veloped to work with low resolution examples and RGB channels.

The step of feature extraction can be complex and time consuming,
and in the end it may not extract the actual relevant characteristics. In
deep learning, the model learns and extracts the relevant features di-
rectly from the images during the training process. CNNs have shown
better performance that other machine learning techniques for the task
of image classiﬁcation (LeCun et al., 2015), what has led to its appli-
cation in several ﬁelds such as object recognition (Sun et al., 2013),
facial key-point detection (Vinyals et al., 2017) or image captioning
(Vinyals et al., 2017). Several works have been developed in the area of
plant recognition taking advantage of the strengths that these models
oﬀer. In (Grinblat et al., 2016), the authors proposed to solve the
problem of plant identiﬁcation with a approach based on leaf vein
morphology. The original images were processed to obtain vein pattern
segmentation, then the images were cropped for central patch extrac-

3. Dataset

Deep learning approaches require a vast amount of examples to
perform well, otherwise the models can overﬁt to the data. For ex-
ample, COCO (common objects in context) dataset has more than
330,000 of images (Lin et al., 2014). Under those circumstances, it is
essential to build our own dataset due to the lack of previous in-
formation. In this section, we present the methodology that we follow
to build our dataset coupled with an analysis of it.

3.1. Case of study

The Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley is located in the south of Mexico,
between the states of Puebla and Oaxaca. The center of the area is lo-
cated at 18.1605° latitude and −97.4202° longitude (decimal degrees)
and covers an area of 10,000 km2. See Fig. 2. Its arid condition is due to
natural walls that surround it, by east the east mountain chain (sierra

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the deep learning pipeline uses images as the primary data format. Specifically, the paper discusses using aerial images for cactus recognition. There is no mention of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format used in this case is images.
