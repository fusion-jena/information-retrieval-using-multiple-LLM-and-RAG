4.4. Image library

Scale and otolith images are used for age and growth estimations. In
IFBA, images are stored in a collaborative online space. The image file
name for any image is the same as the unique archive sample id in the
IFBA database. An example of the data progeny resulting from a fish
scale sample is illustrated in Appendix B. During imaging, the sample id

5.2. Conclusions & future work

Machine Learning is revolutionizing many scientific disciplines,
including marine science (Malde et al., 2019). Indeed, a large amount of

images of fish scales or otoliths (in association with their interpreted
age data), could be used to develop an image recognition algorithm
(Mapp et al., 2017; Moen et al., 2018). The application of machine
learning techniques to the analysis of calcified structures could auto-
mate fish aging. The IFBA system presents a digital and physical in-
frastructure to facilitate such application. Furthermore, with the ad-
vancements in genetic techniques, biomineral archives could also be
seen as analogous to DNA banks, which can be critical to document
changes in the genetic structure of fish populations. The IFBA infra-
structure could also be adapted for any research institute or field office,
and has the potential to catalogue material and images from other
biological sample types, such as corals or shells.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that machine learning techniques, including those based on deep learning, have the potential to automate fish aging by analyzing images of fish scales or otoliths. This suggests that optimization techniques like SGD or Adam may be employed in training these models, but the exact methods used are not specified within the provided context.
