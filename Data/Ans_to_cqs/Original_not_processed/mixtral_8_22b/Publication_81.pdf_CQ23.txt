Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

To solve the problem of high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences, we introduce
a deep learning model to extract useful features and classify ﬁsh from different families,
which is effective and robust.
To address the problem of overﬁtting caused by small dataset due to the limited
number of species in the family, the Elastic Net is introduced for the proposed method
to improve the generalization ability.

• We employ EN-SAE model to receive the outgroup scores. The decision threshold is
automatically learned by the KDE technique. A novel predictor is proposed based on
the outgroup scores, while other classiﬁcation studies often omit the importance of
automatic learning threshold.

• We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method, and the results show
that the ESK model outperforms four commonly used machine learning methods.
The effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed model for ﬁsh classiﬁcation
is demonstrated.

Helpful Answer:

To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they addressed the issue of overfitting caused by small datasets due to the limited number of species in each fish family. They achieved this by introducing the Elastic Net into their proposed method, which improved its generalization ability. Secondly, they employed the EN-SAE model to handle outgroup scores and automatically learn the decision threshold using the KDE technique. This approach allowed them to propose a novel predictor based on outgroup scores, which is not typically considered in other classification studies. Lastly, they evaluated the performance of their method quantitatively and compared it to four commonly used machine learning methods. Their results showed that the ESK model outperformed these methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and feasibility for fish classification tasks. However, there was no explicit mention of diverse datasets or specific validation techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting being used in the given context.
