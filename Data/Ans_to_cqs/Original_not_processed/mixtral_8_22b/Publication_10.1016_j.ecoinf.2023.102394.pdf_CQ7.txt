Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  parameter  selection  was  performed  by  minimizing  the  mean 
squared  error.  The parameter  settings  of the  MLP  model are  listed  in 
Table 2.

2.3.2. Model development 

We  modeled  the  relationship  between  SOCS  and  environmental 

covariates using a general predictive function: 

SOCSi = f (R, PM, S, Ci, Bi)

(4)  

where R is the topography, PM is the parent material, S is the soil var-
iable, C is the climate, and B denotes the biota variable. 

We used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer percep-
tron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. This algorithm is a type of feedforward 
artificial  neural  network  (Bishop,  1995)  comprising  an  input  layer, 
multiple hidden  layers, and  an output  layer. The  input layer  receives 
features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the 
hidden layer hides the extracted features, while the output layer yields 
the  prediction  results  (SOCS).  Except  for  the  input  layer,  each  layer 
consists  of  a  set  of  individual  nodes  (neurons).  Each  node  connects 
adjacent layers via the activation function. The MLP technique develops

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. Therefore, it cannot be determined based on the given context.
