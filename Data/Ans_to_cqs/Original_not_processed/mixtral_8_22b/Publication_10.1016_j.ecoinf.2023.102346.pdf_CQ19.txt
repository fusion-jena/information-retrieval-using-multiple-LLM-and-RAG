The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

2.6. Model selection 

Since  performance,  accuracy,  key  parameters,  and  sensitivity  for 
prediction vary depending on which method that is used (Diniz-Filho 
et al., 2009; Elith et al., 2006; Qiao et al., 2015), we tested eight different 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  our  predictive  models.  The 
included  algorithms  were:  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM),  Support 
Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Spline 
(MARS),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Flexible  Discriminant  Analysis  (FDA), 
Classification  and  Regression  Trees  (CART),  Generalized  Boosting 
regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for 
habitat suitability prediction (Table S5).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch has been mentioned. Instead, several machine learning packages and tools have been utilized for various purposes within this research. These include "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2" for testing prediction power with machine learning algorithms, and "shiny" packages for extracting model mean performances. Additionally, statistical analyses were conducted using R, specifically RStudio. However, none of these directly indicate the use of any popular deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be determined which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
