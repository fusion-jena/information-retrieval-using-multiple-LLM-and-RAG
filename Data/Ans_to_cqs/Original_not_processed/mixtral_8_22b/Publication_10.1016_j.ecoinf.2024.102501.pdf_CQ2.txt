Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the research focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water, we can infer that the data format used would likely be structured data, such as CSV files containing various water quality parameters like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc. These parameters serve as input variables for the machine learning and deep learning models mentioned in the text, including SVR (Support Vector Regression) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Therefore, while the exact data format isn't specified, it can be assumed that the researchers utilized structured datasets containing relevant water quality information.
