iii.  Experimental group III: Take 40%, 60%, and 80% of the original 
dataset as the new dataset, and then replace 80% of these three 
datasets with the generated images. 

Table 6 presents the detailed division of the datasets. The datasets 
were  split  into  train  and  test  sets  in  an  8:2  ratio,  and  all  evaluation 
metrics were computed on the test set. 

To conduct the classification experiments on all datasets, we utilized 
ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 as the base classifier model. The 
experiments  were  conducted  with  consistent  hyperparameters, 
including a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and 40 epochs. 

The  classification  results  of  Experiment  Group  I  are  presented  in 
Fig.  10.  The  bar  graphs  represent  the  Top-1  accuracy  of  the  Mobile-
NetV2, ResNet18, and VGG16 models on the six datasets. The fold line 
corresponds to their respective Top-5 accuracy. When 1000 generated

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several datasets derived from the original dataset by taking different percentages (40%, 60%, and 80%) of it and replacing varying proportions of those subsets with generated images. These datasets are labeled as G1\_Dataset1 through G3\_Dataset3\_mixup. The specific details of the original dataset are not mentioned in the given information. However, the datasets are divided into training and testing sets in an 8:2 ratio, and all evaluation metrics are calculated based on the test set. The classification experiments are performed using ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 as the base classifier models with consistent hyperparameters such as a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and 40 epochs.
