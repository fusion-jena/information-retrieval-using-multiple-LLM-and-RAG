rice canopy coverage with the largest error in C3 and the smallest error 
in C2 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that RF is a machine learning model 
that is suitable for LCC estimation, but the estimation accuracy of the C1 
and  C3  regions  still  require  to  be  improved.  The  study  area  can  be 
divided according to crop coverage, and the overall estimation accuracy 
of the study area can be improved by searching for suitable VIs that are 
sensitive to LCC under different coverage conditions.

and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated using three main metrics: R2, RMSE, and REP (%). R2 represents the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model. RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error, which quantifies the difference between values predicted by a model or estimator and the actual values. Lastly, REP (%) denotes the relative percentage error, calculated as the absolute difference between the estimated and true values divided by the true value, expressed as a percentage.
