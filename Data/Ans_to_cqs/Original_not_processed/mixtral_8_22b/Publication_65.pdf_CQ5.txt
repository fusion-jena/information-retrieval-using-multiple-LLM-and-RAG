The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

We adopted the same training/trial protocol for all CNNs. All networks used in
this research have been trained from scratch (i.e., without pre-trained weights from other
datasets, like ImageNet, for example). We used 1938 input patch sizes of 256 × 256 pixels,
with 388 patches for the test, 1162 for train, and 388 for validation, a distribution of approx-
imately 20%, 60%, and 20% respectively. It is important to note that additional input patch
sizes were tested in an experimental phase, but the results did not change considerably
and only increased the training time. All approaches used the same set of hyperparam-
eters during training, which was deﬁned based on previous analyses. Speciﬁcally, the
learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and iterations were 0.01, 0.005, 0.9, and 200,000,
respectively. The model is optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). To assist
the convergence process and prevent overﬁtting (Overﬁtting is a concept used to refer to a

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

before dataset, i.e., a test dataset), after 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced
following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. Aside from this,
we used rotation, noise, and ﬂip (as in [50]) for data augmentation, and we were capable
of augmenting the dataset by six times. With the data augmentation technique, we can
make the CNN classiﬁcation more robust and generalize better. In Figure 9, we can see the
schematic diagram for the evaluation process.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, they state that they used their own dataset consisting of 1938 input patch sizes of 256 x 256 pixels, with 388 patches for testing, 1162 for training, and 388 for validation. This distribution represents approximately 20%, 60%, and 20% of the total dataset, respectively. They also mentioned that they experimented with different input patch sizes, but the results did not significantly improve, so they decided to use the current size. Additionally, they employed data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flip to increase the dataset by six times, making the CNN classification more robust and improving its ability to generalize.
