in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the

a minimum.

2.2. Bayesian statistics and ultrasound analysis 

All statistics and production of figures were done in GNU R version 
3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019)  or QGIS version 3.16 (QGIS Development 
Team,  2018).  To  show  the  obvious  benefits  of  considering  additional 
information about bats found outside the realm of the ultrasound itself, 
examples are given in the form of a simple artwork, and also through R- 
code.  The  simple  example  is  self-explanatory,  whereas  the  R-code  is 
explained in some detail. The full R-code, written in Rmarkdown with 
user guidance, can be found in supplement S1. This supplement will also

full  sample  (N  = 10,000)  using  both  uninformative  and  informative 
priors through the R-code (supplement S1). The outcome is presented in 
a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, it does discuss the use of Bayesian statistics and ultrasound analysis for ecological informatics. It mentions that all statistics and production of figures were done in GNU R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019) or QGIS version 3.16 (QGIS Development Team, 2018). Additionally, it states that examples are given in the form of a simple artwork, and also through R-code, with the full R-code being available in supplement S1. Therefore, while the exact postprocessing steps are not mentioned, one could infer that they might involve generating visualizations and performing further analyses using tools like R and QGIS.
