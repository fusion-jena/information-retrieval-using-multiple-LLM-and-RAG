when i-th sample (the ground truth label is c) fed into the model, zi  is 
logits of the output, zi, j is a value of zi, j ∈ {1, 2, …, M} indicates the class 
labels (age). pi, j is the probability of i-th sample which belongs to class j. 
Based on Eq. (1), we can compute the CE loss (Lce) as follow: 

Seven  models  from  four  types  of  CNN  obtained  different  perfor-
mances in our experiments (Table 2). The OR method achieved better 
performance than the MC method based on different models. The results 
suggested that ordinal age information can help models learn intraclass 
and interclass relationships. Our results showed that RepVGG achieved a

pandas aged 7 to 17 years.

different VGG nets, such as VGG-11, VGG-16, and VGG-19. VGG-16 has 
been applied in many researches and it is often used to extract features in 
the age estimation tasks Pan et al. (2018). In this study, we replaced the 
last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with 
one FC layer to reduce parameters. And we adopt Batch Normalization 
(BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) to accelerate the training of networks. 
For this study, we selected VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN to extract the 
features from panda facial images.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices include monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or desired threshold. Other methods may involve setting a maximum number of epochs or using early stopping techniques. Without explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used in this case.
