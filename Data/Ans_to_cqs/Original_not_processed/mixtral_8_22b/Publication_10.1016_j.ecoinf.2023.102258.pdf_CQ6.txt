• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.

Inspecting  the  characteristics  of  the  methods  performing  most 
strongly in the challenge, broadly across all editions, we observe some 
general tendencies (Table 3). Firstly, there is relatively little variation in 
the  acoustic  features  extracted,  and  the  neural  network  architecture: 
most systems use Mel spectrograms with PCEN, and standard CNNs. The 
main innovation in this aspect comes from You et al. (2023), where the 
CNN is replaced by the audio spectrogram transformer (AST). However, 
there is considerable variation in the method of training the network, 
and performing inference. There is a roughly equal balance of the two 
main paradigms: meta-learning with prototypical networks, versus fine- 
tuning or otherwise adapting a network trained using cross-entropy.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit details about specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that many machine learning systems use Mel spectrograms with Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN) as acoustic features. Additionally, it discusses how long audio files are divided into shorter chunks to fit within GPU memory limitations during training. These points suggest that feature extraction and segmentation might be common preprocessing steps when working with audio data in deep learning applications.
