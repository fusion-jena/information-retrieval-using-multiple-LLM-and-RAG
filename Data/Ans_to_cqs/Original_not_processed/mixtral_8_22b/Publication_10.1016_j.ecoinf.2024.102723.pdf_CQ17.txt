Deep Neural Networks are architectures that present remarkable
advantages and can potentially map every possible function, but they
are often affected by many issues such as overfitting. The main draw-
back of standard Deep Learning is that Neural Networks compute single
values of their parameters and therefore they are incapable of correctly
assessing the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) or to
the model itself (epistemic uncertainty); in fact they often produce
overly confident decisions about the correct class, prediction or action to
take, even if the sample is very far from the training data we provided.
The purpose of Bayesian Neural Networks is to use probability theory
to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. The advantage
is clear in areas where decision making plays a fundamental role. To be
more specific, a Probabilistic Neural Network handles the aleatoric
uncertainty by placing a probability distribution (whose parameters can

Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) is a very convenient technique for
performing Bayesian Deep learning, as it is straightforward to imple-
ment and requires little additional knowledge or modeling effort
compared to traditional methods. According to (Gal and Ghahramani,
2016), while implementing the Monte Carlo Dropout we used the Ber-
noulli distribution: this regularization technique corresponds to an
approximate variational distribution and results in uncertainty esti-
mates. Other variants of dropout follow this interpretation as well and
correspond to alternative approximate distributions. This would result
in different uncertainty estimates, setting a trade-off between uncer-
tainty quality and computational complexity. Currently the research
activities focus on these aspects, as well as on the study of non-linearity-
regularization combinations and the corresponding predictive mean and
variance.

The Neural Networks were built from scratch, implemented using
TensorFlow (tf) (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015).
Coupled with TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by
Google, Keras serves as a high-level Neural Networks API, offering a
seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying
deep learning models. The MCD layers consist of a modification of the
Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive
from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module (in particular, we used the
DenseVariational type of layers). These two architectures have the same
input and output layers, they differ for the structure of the hidden layers.
The size of the input layer depends on the problem we are facing: it has
two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD. As our focus will be on
dealing with regression problems, the output layer is actually a combi-
nation of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a

Within the context of phenology prediction, applications of Deep
Learning incorporating Bayesian concepts are still sparse, if not entirely
absent. A work with a similar theme, in which Bayesian deep learning is
used to assess the health of a plant and detect possible diseases, is
(Hern´andez and L´opez, 2020). Here, the authors use Monte Carlo
Dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), a technique known to be a good
approximation of Bayesian inference, to estimate the uncertainty of a
Convolutional Neural Network. Despite achieving satisfactory results,
this work relies on the use of pre-trained models. While this can be seen

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the primary regularization method mentioned is Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). Dropout is a widely used regularization technique in deep learning to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly dropping out neurons during training, effectively creating a new network architecture for each iteration. In the case of MCD, it uses the Bernoulli distribution to perform dropout, resulting in uncertainty estimates. This makes MCD a convenient technique for performing Bayesian Deep Learning. Other variants of dropout also exist, which correspond to alternative approximate distributions and offer different uncertainty estimates, setting a trade-off between uncertainty quality and computational complexity. Apart from dropout, no other explicit regularization techniques like L2 regularization are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
