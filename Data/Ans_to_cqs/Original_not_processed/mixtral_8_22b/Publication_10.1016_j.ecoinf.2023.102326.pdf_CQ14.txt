3.2.3. Complex network measures 

After the network is constructed, a plethora of quantitative network 
measures become available (Newman, 2018). We investigate the utility 
of the network’s Average Shortest Path  length (ASPL) for the studied 
networks. ASPL can be defined as (Barab´asi, 2013): 

ASPL =

d(s, t)
n(n (cid:0) 1)

∑

s, t ∈ V
s ∕= t

two examples for the LUTs “Main Street” and “Urban Forest”, depicting 
every step from the FCM, to thresholding, to the adjacency matrix and its 
respective network representation.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, I do not have enough information to give a helpful response.
