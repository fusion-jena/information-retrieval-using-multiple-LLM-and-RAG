both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

package  in  R  (Liaw  and  Wiener,  2002).  We  tuned  the  mtry  hyper-
parameter with the caret package in R (Kuhn, 2008) while keeping other 
hyperparameters at their default values. However, we explored varia-
tions in the ntree parameter, experimenting with settings of 500, 1000, 
5000, and 10,000. With a cutoff of 0.7, we also tested models in which 
features are selected prior to training using the findCorrelation function 
in the Caret package in R. We also used a majority voting strategy, using 
the mode for classification Q1 and the median for Q2 regression (see 
2.5.1  and  2.5.2).  In  this  process,  each  5-m  segment  within  a  450  m 
multitemporal  transect  is  assigned  a  predicted  class  or  a  continuous 
value for regression. This side-by-side analysis allowed us to assess the

based  machine-learning  approach  in  contrast  to  ‘traditional’  metrics- 
based methods.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit details about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the fast.ai platform for training and validating models, which could potentially utilize various optimization algorithms depending on the configuration. Additionally, the text discusses the application of transfer learning, where a pre-trained ResNet-34 model is leveraged for specialized tasks with limited data. While the optimization technique used during the initial training of the ResNet-34 model isn't specified, it can be assumed that some form of gradient descent optimization was employed due to its prevalent usage in deep learning models.
