Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

2.4. Model training 

23,401  datacubes  (97.9%  of  the  original  EarthNet2021  training 
dataset) were used for training, 500 datacubes for validation, and three 
datacubes were discarded (see above). The model was trained using the 
L2  loss  determined  on  the  predicted  and  observed  RGBI  channels 
(ignoring the cloud-contaminated pixels). The EarthNetScore (described 
in Section 2.5) is used for validation. The learning rate is set to 0.0003 

and the batch size is set to 4. We decided to use the AdamW optimizer, 
which,  unlike  the  standard  Adam  optimizer  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014), 
decouples the weight decay and has also shown to improve on gener-
alization  (Loshchilov  and  Hutter,  2017).  The  SGConvLSTM  and  the 
SGEDConvLSTM were trained for 92 and 45 epochs, respectively. For 
completeness,  a  full  list  of  the  model  parameters  is  provided  in 
Tables A.2 and A.3 in the Supporting Information.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline uses the AdamW optimizer. Unlike the standard Adam optimizer, AdamW decouples the weight decay, which has been shown to improve generalization. The learning rate is set to 0.0003. Additionally, hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure.
