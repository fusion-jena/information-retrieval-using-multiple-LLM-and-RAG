Other studies followed the Fine-Grained Image Classification (FGIC) 
methods (Wang et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2018) and have used the Mask 
Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) (Wei et al., 2018) and attention 
guided data augmentation (Wang et al., 2023) to categorize the birds at 
a detailed level using bounding boxes and part annotations and achieved 
85–87% accuracy. However, further improvements are warranted in the 
accuracy achieved by these studies. Ferreira et al. (Ferreira et al., 2020) 
utilized Raspberry Pi and pre-trained CNN models to identify individual 
birds  in  a  laboratory  and  achieved  90%  accuracy  but  they  could  not 
address the challenges of working with birds in their natural and captive 
environments.

networks  experienced  overfitting,  failing  to  generalize  effectively. 
Several  data  augmentation  techniques  were  employed  to  address  this 
issue.  Data  augmentation  expands  a  dataset  by  applying  trans-
formations, such as flipping, translation, and shear, to the existing data 
(Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Data augmentation helps maintain 
dataset balance, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of 
deep learning models (Mungloo-Dilmohamud et al., 2022). In this study, 
horizontal and vertical translations were done within a range of (cid:0) 30 to 
30 pixels, allowing random shifts. Shear distortion was applied within a 
range of (cid:0) 5 to 5, representing maximum distortion to the left and right. 
Table 3 details the transformations used for data augmentation on the 
selected  dataset.  After  augmentation,  the  training  dataset  size  was 
increased from 11,788 to 40,000 images. After the data augmentation,

provide more task specific features, benefited from fine-tuning as they 
were adjusted specifically for the dataset. Across all four classifications, 
the fine-tuning strategy consistently outperformed the feature extractor 
strategy  based  on  performance  metrics  such  as  accuracy,  precision, 
recall,  and  F1  score.  The  improvement  in  accuracy  was  attributed  to 
fine-tuning the top layers of the convolutional base using the dataset. 
EfficientB0  demonstrated  superior  performance  in  all  metrics.  It  ach-
ieved  the  highest  accuracy  in  three  partitions,  with  percentages  of 
96.56%,  97.89%,  and  99.12%,  respectively.  ResNet18  requires  less 
training time because it has a smaller network size and fewer parame-
ters.  However,  ResNet18  showed  slightly  lower  performance  in  three 
partitions  with  an  accuracy  of  89.33%,  93.21%,  and  93.24%,  respec-
tively, due to its limited capacity and potential for overfitting due to its

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some studies follow the Fine-Grained Image Classification (FGIC) methods and use the Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) and attention guided data augmentation to categorize birds at a detailed level using bounding boxes and part annotations. This suggests that bounding box annotation and possibly instance segmentation might be among the data annotation techniques used in those studies. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images, while instance segmentation is a technique where each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to an object or background category. These techniques help train deep learning models to recognize and localize objects accurately.
