2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

The linearity describes how elongated the adjacency is,
the planarity assesses how plane the adjacency is, the high-
scattering values are used to represent an isotropic and
spherical adjacency. We describe these three point features
as geometric features.

training, we set the learning decay rate to 0.7 so that the
learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.
Table 1 shows the experimental results in which we ﬁxed
the voxel size and batch size and adjusted the regulariza-
tion strength, from which we can be told that result is better
while regularization strength is 0.2.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the optimization of hyperparameters was done through experimentation rather than using specific methods like grid search or random search. In Table 1, the authors fixed the voxel size and batch size while adjusting the regularization strength to find the best value. However, there isn't any explicit mention of using grid search or random search techniques for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, it seems that the authors employed manual trial-and-error experiments to determine the optimal hyperparameters for their model.
