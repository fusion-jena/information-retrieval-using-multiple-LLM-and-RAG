1. Introduction

Understanding processes and factors affecting carbon uptake by the 
vegetation is essential for investigating the ability of an ecosystem to 
capture and store CO2 (Di Vita et al., 2017). Gross primary productivity 
(GPP) indicates the overall amount of CO2  captured by the ecosystem 
during the process of photosynthesis (Kirschbaum et al., 2001; Wu et al., 
2014).  Ecosystem  respiration  (RE)  refers  to  the  total  amount  of  CO2 
released  into  the  atmosphere  during  autotrophic  and  heterotrophic 
respiration (Hopkins et al., 2013). The difference between GPP and RE 
indicates Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), and the negative of NEP 
denotes  Net  Ecosystem  Exchange  (NEE).  NEE  indicates  whether  the 
ecosystem is a net carbon source to the atmosphere (positive NEE) or a 
net carbon sink (negative NEE). An in-depth understanding of NEE re-
veals the carbon dynamics associated with the ecosystem as it provides

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, which involves handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. Normalization and scaling are also important preprocessing techniques used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In addition, feature selection can be performed to identify relevant features that contribute significantly to the output variable. It is crucial to note that the choice of preprocessing steps depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data being analyzed.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to additional resources or consult domain experts for more accurate information.
