ImageNet)  to  be  adapted  for  plant-specific  classification  tasks.  Re-
searchers have achieved improved classification accuracy with smaller 
training datasets by leveraging the learned representations from these 
general-purpose models. Too et al. (Too et al., 2018) demonstrated the 
effectiveness  of  fine-tuning  pretrained  CNN  models  for  plant  disease 
classification.  Despite  advancements  in  plant  image  classification, 
several challenges persist. One significant challenge is the presence of 
interclass  similarities  and  intraclass  variations  in  plant  species. 
Addressing  these  challenges  requires  robust  feature  representations, 
data  augmentation  techniques,  and  advanced  network  architectures. 
Additionally,  the  interpretability  of  deep  learning  models  and  their
