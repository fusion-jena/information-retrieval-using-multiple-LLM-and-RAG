To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the ensemble modeling approach in this study was not explicitly stated as being related to deep learning or any specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred that the goal of employing this approach was to create a robust and accurate model for predicting the distribution of the study species. This was achieved by combining multiple models, including regression-based and machine-learning algorithms like Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were then weight-averaged to produce a final ensembled model for each species. The accuracy of these models was tested through cross-validation, with the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) serving as the metric for assessing their performance. Therefore, while not directly mentioned, the purpose of this ensemble modeling approach could be seen as a form of multi-class classification, where the classes are the potential distributions of the study species.
