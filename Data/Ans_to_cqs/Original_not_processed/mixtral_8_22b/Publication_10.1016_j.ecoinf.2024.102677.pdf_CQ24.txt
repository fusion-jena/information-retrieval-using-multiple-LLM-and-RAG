as deep learning methods to promote a deeper understanding of rural 
landscapes.

To ensure the stability of the proposed models, we randomly divided 
the  dataset  into  three  parts:  training  (60%),  validation  (20%),  and 
testing  (20%)  (Meng  et  al.,  2022).  This  division  was  performed  in  a 
stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. 
The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (2880 images), a 
validation set (961 images), and a testing set (958 images). The models 
were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 × 256 image input 
size. After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of 
epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to fix the random seed value for reproducibility purposes. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure that their results will remain consistent even when running multiple experiments or simulations. Another strategy is to perform cross-validation, which involves splitting the data into different subsets for training, validation, and testing. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization by ensuring that the model has been exposed to a diverse range of examples during training. Additionally, techniques such as ensemble learning and bootstrap aggregating (bagging) can also help to mitigate the effects of randomness by combining the predictions of multiple models or resampling the data with replacement, respectively. In the given context, the authors have used stratified sampling to divide the dataset into three parts - training, validation, and testing sets - while maintaining class proportions across all parts. They have also mentioned using an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a specific image input size and setting parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs after parameter tuning. However, they do not explicitly mention any strategies related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be determined what specific strategies are being employed to handle randomness in this case.
