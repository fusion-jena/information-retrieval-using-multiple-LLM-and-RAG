Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

input data (taking a tree and a pole as examples). b Is a hand-crafted
point cloud partition, c each partition is converted into a superpoint of

the SPG, and d is the network for superpoint embedding and
segmentation based on PointNet and GRU. The black lines represent

The linearity describes how elongated the adjacency is,
the planarity assesses how plane the adjacency is, the high-
scattering values are used to represent an isotropic and
spherical adjacency. We describe these three point features
as geometric features.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific method or source used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the input data includes a tree and a pole, which could suggest the use of remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or photogrammetry. These technologies often employ sensors mounted on aircraft or drones to gather detailed spatial data, including trees and poles. Additionally, references to works like Guan et al.'s "Deep learning-based tree classification using mobile LiDAR data" and Hackel et al.'s "Semantic3d.net: A new large-scale point cloud classification benchmark" indicate potential usage of LiDAR data. Nonetheless, without more precise details regarding the data collection method, one cannot definitively state whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets were employed.
