3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

3.4. Deep learning models 

In this work, we propose deep-learning architectures to classify plant

diseases. We also propose using different ensembles to increase classi-
fication accuracy. To this end, five different deep-learning models are 
proposed to classify plant diseases. The chosen models are:  

Precision = TP

TP + FP

• DenseNet201 

• Recall 

(2)    

DenseNet is a network proposed by (Huang et al., 2017). In this 
network,  each  Layer  has  a  connection  with  subsequent  Layers. 
Densenet201 is a CNN that has 201 deep layers.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources were utilized for training the models based solely on the provided context.
