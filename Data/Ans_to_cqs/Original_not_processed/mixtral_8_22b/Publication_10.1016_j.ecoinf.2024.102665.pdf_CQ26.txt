Increasing  the  dimensions  used  in  the  assessment  through  additional 
variables can therefore be useful (Peterson and Evans, 2019). Due to the 
restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as 
other  learning  methods  (Kekolahti  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the  con-
straints (only one incoming connection per node) allow only the nodes 
with the strongest associations to be connected.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about machine learning and deep learning pipelines, several common techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class proportions in both sets. This technique ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class, reducing potential biases caused by class imbalance.

Oversampling and undersampling are two popular techniques used to handle class imbalances in datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones using algorithms like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing samples or employing more sophisticated techniques such as Tomek links or NearMiss.

Collecting diverse data is another essential strategy to minimize data bias. By gathering data from various sources, demographics, and environments, it becomes possible to create a more comprehensive and unbiased dataset. This approach helps ensure that the trained models perform well across different scenarios and populations.

While these techniques are commonly used to address data bias, their effectiveness depends on the specific problem and dataset at hand. It is crucial to carefully evaluate the impact of each method on the overall performance and fairness of the deep learning model.
