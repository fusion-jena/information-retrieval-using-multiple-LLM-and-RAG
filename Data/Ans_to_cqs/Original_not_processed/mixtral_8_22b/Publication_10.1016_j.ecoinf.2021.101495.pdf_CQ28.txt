2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016). 
In particular, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow 
and  pre-trained  with  the  ImageNet  dataset  (training  parameters  in

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
