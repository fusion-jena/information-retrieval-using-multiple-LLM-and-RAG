(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

work (Leng et al., 2017; Pouteau et al., 2011; Quej et al., 2017; Vapnik,
1995). Therefore, in this paper, the comparison between the BPNN
model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

BPNN is one of the most well-developed and widely used ANN
models (Partovi and Anandarajan, 2002; Zhang and Wu, 2008). Im-
pressive results have been achieved in the areas of carbon emissions
(Sun and Xu, 2016; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015) and water issues
(Qaderi and Babanejad, 2017). However, the BPNN has a slow con-
vergence rate and tends to reach a local minimum, so the selection of
the number of hidden nodes in the network is uncertain (Byvatov et al.,
2003). When the classical support vector machine (SVM) was proposed
in the 1990s, it received extensive attention due to its complete theo-
retical framework and the encouraging results of its application in the
area of machine learning. Recently, SVM has been primarily used for
regression analysis because it requires relatively smaller sample sizes
across some time spans and is capable of overcoming the inevitable
local extremum issues caused by overﬁtting in an artiﬁcial neural net-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the frameworks or libraries used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that since 2006, deep learning algorithms have broken the limitations of traditional neural networks regarding the number of layers, allowing them to extract deeply hidden characteristics and features using large-scale data training. The text also discusses comparisons between the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model but does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
