networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

of dilated convolution with various dilated rates to enlarge the receptive 
field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

2.3. Model training 

Our study can be categorized as a binary classification. We supervise 
TrunkNet’s training with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, 
which  is  a  commonly  employed  loss  function  in  supervised  deep 
learning (Zhao et al., 2019b). The BCE loss function measures the dif-
ference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Mini-
mizing this difference indicates a better training effect. Specifically, the 
BCE loss function in use is expressed with 

L BCE = (cid:0)

∑H

∑W

x=1

y=1

G(x, y)logSpre(x, y) + (1 (cid:0) G(x, y))log(1 (cid:0) Spre(x, y)),

(3)  

where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of 
the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre  is the final pre-
dicted saliency map.

and can yield desirable saliency identification results on public datasets. 
Recent deep SOD models based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) 
(Long et al., 2015) are committed to extracting and fusing multi-scale 
features, aiming to produce comprehensive representations of various 
objects to generate the final saliency predictions. For instance, Liu et al. 
(2019b)  (PoolNet)  incorporated  a  pyramid  pooling  module  into  the 
feature pyramid network (FPN) (Lin et al., 2017) architecture to pass 
high-level semantic information, which is aggregated into feature maps 
at different levels. Zhao et al. (2020) (GateNet) proposed the FPN-based 
gate  mechanism  to  cooperatively  fuse  multi-level  features,  enhancing 
the overall discernment capability of the network.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that recent deep SOD models have been successful in generating desirable saliency identification results on public datasets. This suggests that these models may have undergone some form of validation process involving diverse data sources. Additionally, the mention of incorporating a pyramid pooling module into the FPN architecture by PoolNet implies that the model was designed to handle varying input sizes and resolutions, further contributing to its potential generalizability. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence regarding the exact methods used to validate and improve the model's performance across different scenarios, one cannot definitively state what measures were specifically taken to ensure its generalizability.
