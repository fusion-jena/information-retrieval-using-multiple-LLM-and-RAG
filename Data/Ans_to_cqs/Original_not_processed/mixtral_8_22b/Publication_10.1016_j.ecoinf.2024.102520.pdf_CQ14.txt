and STP as a function of distance between sample sites according to Eq.

The basic spatial characteristics, i.e., nugget (C0), sill (C + C0), and 
range (A), which provide details about the structure and serve as the 
input variables for the kriging interpolation, were derived by the model 
semivariograms. In particular, “nugget” is the variance at zero distance, 
“sill” is the lag interval between observations at which one value for a 
variable  does  not  impact  nearby  values,  and  “range”  is  the  radius  at 
which  the  values  of  a  variable  become  spatially  independent  (L´opez- 
Granados et al., 2002). 

The geostatistical analyst extension of ArcGIS v.9.3.1, allowed the 
semivariogram computation, cross-validation and mapping. The accu-
racy of soil maps was assessed using a cross validation technique. Any of 
the three-assessment metrics used in this study, i.e., the mean absolute 
error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and quality of prediction (G), 
could assess the precision and efficacy of predictions.

application and farming practices (Fu et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; P. 
Yang  et  al.,  2022).  The  nugget  ratio  of  TSP  for  agricultural  land  use 
(14.2%) revealed a substantial geographical dependency, whereas a TSP 
ratio of 76.2% for mixed land use indicated a weak dependency. How-
ever,  false  or  incorrect  spatial  dependency  may  result  from  limited 
sampling and/or improper setting of model parameters. The extensive 
sampling employed in this work reduced sample error and increased the 
Kriging accuracy to avoid errors.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization might have been performed due to the discussion around avoiding errors and increasing Kriging accuracy. Additionally, the table shows different models being applied to analyze various lands, suggesting possible experimentation with different parameter settings. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the optimization process, we cannot definitively state what method was used.
