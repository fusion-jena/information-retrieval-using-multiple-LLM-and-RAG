Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remark-
able stability and effectiveness in big data analytics (Bai et al., 2019; 
Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023).  Recently,  these  techniques  have  been 
increasingly  applied  to  carbon  emission  forecasting,  showcasing  their 
broad utility (Table 1). Among these, Backpropagation Neural Networks 
(BPNN) stand out for their widespread use and notable forecast accuracy 
(Lin et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2023). Yet, more recent 
studies have highlighted that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural 
networks  outperform  other  models  in  both  forecast  accuracy  and 
training  efficiency  (Kumar,  2023;  Liu  et  al.,  2024b;  Shi  et  al.,  2023). 
Furthermore,  LSTM  have  been  recognized  for  their  ability  to  adeptly 
handle multiple time-variable inputs, exhibiting superior accuracy and 
stability compared to traditional machine learning models (Gokul et al.,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in the given context. However, it does provide details about the application of the Tree Parzen Estimator Bayesian Optimization (TPEBO) algorithm for optimizing hyperparameters in LSTM models. This technique is particularly useful for fine-tuning LSTM models due to their complex structure. It begins with random searches for possible hyperparameter configurations before gradually focusing on areas where a local optimum has been found, thus progressively approaching the global optimum. This automated process improves the model's efficiency and significantly reduces the time typically spent on manual tuning.

In terms of hyperparameters, the context mentions three key parameters: the number of cells in hidden layers, initial learning rate, and L2 regularization parameter. The number of cells in hidden layers ranges from 10 to 200, which strikes a balance between capturing detailed data patterns and avoiding overfitting. The initial learning rate, which controls the step size during parameter updating, falls within the range of [1e-3, 1]. Lastly, the L2 regularization parameter, which regulates overfitting by imposing penalties on large weights, lies between 1e-2 and 1e-10. These parameters are crucial in shaping the architecture of deep learning models and guiding the learning process.
