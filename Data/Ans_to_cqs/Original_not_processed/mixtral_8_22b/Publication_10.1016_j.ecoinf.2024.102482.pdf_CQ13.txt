The input layer receives two-dimensional data of size [observation 
time (s) × 4, 1]. As mentioned (section 2.4.3), the output vector sizes of 
the three LSTM layers were set to 32, 32, and 16, respectively, and a 
dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. The number of stacked 
LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model 
hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve 
optimal performance. 

We have summarized the components of the proposed system into an 
overall  learning  and  testing  procedure  of  the  monitoring  system  in 
Fig. 6. During the learning stage, features are extracted from the training 
data set using the previously introduced feature extraction algorithm, 
and the  model is  trained. After the training is  completed, the trained 
model  is  used  to  predict  water  conditions  and  analyze  performance 
using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage. 

2.4.5. Performance metrics

The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

2.2. Feature extraction 

To  solve  problems  using  the  machine  learning  method,  extracting 
features from the raw data to be used as inputs for the machine learning 
model is necessary. Although the importance of feature extraction has 
decreased with the introduction of deep learning, there are still aspects 
where features play a key role, such as considering the computing power 
of devices, reducing training time, and ensuring real-time performance 
in decision-making. 

In  this paper,  we used  the BLS  entropy profile to  characterize the 
swimming behavior of C. elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). 
The BLS profile has also been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, 
an indicator of how similar two sequences are, in order to illuminate the 
similarities  and  differences  in  swimming  patterns  of  C.  elegans  in  a 
controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment (Kang et al.,

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated. However, some details about the architecture of the model are provided. For instance, the model consists of three Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with output vector sizes of 32, 32, and 16, respectively. Additionally, a dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. These are examples of hyperparameters that influence the structure and behavior of the model. Unfortunately, the context does not provide information regarding other hyperparameters such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or epoch count. Therefore, these values remain unknown based on the available information.
