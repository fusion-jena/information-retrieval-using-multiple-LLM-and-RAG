Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Number of cells in hidden layers: Vital for fitting complex functions, 
the range for the number of cells in each layer is set between 10 and 200. 
This range balances the need to capture intricate data patterns and avoid 
overfitting. 

Initial learning rate: This determines the step size during parameter

updating.  The  chosen  range,  [1e

avoiding too rapid updates (which can cause instability) and too slow 
updates (leading to prolonged training). 

L2 regularization parameter: Adjusting this helps control overfitting 
by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set 
(cid:0) 2, in line with benchmarks from similar studies.

Where. 
xi  is the input independent variable value, 
n is the number of groups of forecasted variables, 
̂yi  is the forecasted value, 
yi  is the actual value, 
λ is the L2 regularization parameter (λ > 0), 
wj  is the weight of each layer in the LSTM neural network,  

(3)  Optimizing iteration and result optimization. 

The  input  dataset,  hyperparameter  search  range,  optimization 
objective  function,  and  algorithm  predefined  are  integrated  into  the 
TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

This study sets out to enhance model performance on the test set, 
emphasizing generalizability. The chosen objective function is the mean 
absolute  error  (MAE)  between  forecasted  outcomes  and  actual  data, 
augmented  with  an  L2  regularization  term  to  prevent  overfitting, 
thereby aligning with the TPEBO framework's goals of minimizing MAE

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it appears that the training process is determined by a fixed number of iterations rather than specific criteria such as a validation loss plateau. According to the information provided, the TPEBO-LSTM model undergoes a training process consisting of 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model records the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. However, there is no mention of any stopping criterion based on the validation loss or other metrics. Therefore, it seems that the training process continues until all 10,000 iterations have been completed.
