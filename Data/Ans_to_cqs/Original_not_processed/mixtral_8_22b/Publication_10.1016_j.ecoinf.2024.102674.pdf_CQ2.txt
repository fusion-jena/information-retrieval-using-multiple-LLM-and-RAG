Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that they use geospatial data related to climate and meteorology. This could include various types of data such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. The data is likely stored in numerical format, possibly using file formats like CSV or NetCDF, which are commonly used for storing scientific data. Additionally, some studies may also utilize satellite imagery or other forms of remote sensing data, which would typically be in raster format. Without more detailed information about the specific methods employed by these researchers, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in their deep learning pipelines.
