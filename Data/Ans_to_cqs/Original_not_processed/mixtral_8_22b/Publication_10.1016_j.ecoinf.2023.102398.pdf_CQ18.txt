5. Results and discussion 

In this section, the results derived from the training of the proposed 
model  and  the  results  obtained  by  deploying  the  trained  model  are 
discussed. 

5.1. Experimental result

In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

The confusion matrix (Fig. 6), F1 curve (Fig. 7), P curve (Fig. 8), PR 
curve (Fig. 9), R curve (Fig. 10) and final training plots (Fig. 11) are 
shown for the training of the model with attention layer with epoch-150. 
Some training batch outputs are shown in Fig. 12, and some validation 
outputs are shown in Fig. 13.

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the authors have employed several strategies. They have trained the model with varying epoch values such as 100, 150, 200, and 250 to explore the impact of epoch on training results. This approach helps them identify the optimal number of epochs required for achieving the best possible accuracy without overfitting or underfitting the model. Additionally, they have utilized various evaluation metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), Confusion Matrix, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess the model's performance. Furthermore, they have visualized the training progress using figures depicting the loss function, learning rate schedules, and other relevant information. Lastly, they have ensured that the dataset used for training is sufficiently large and diverse to prevent any potential biases or limitations in the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
