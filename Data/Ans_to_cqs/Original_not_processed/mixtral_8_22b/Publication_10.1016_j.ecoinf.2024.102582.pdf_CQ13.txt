5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The authors mention using a deep learning approach but do not discuss details such as learning rates or optimizers. For more detailed information, please refer to the original source or contact the authors directly.

Based on the given context, there is no explicit information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query. It would be best to consult the original source or reach out to the authors for further clarification.
