On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

accuracies on three data sets are 90.16% , 92.60% ,and 92.56% 
respectively.  Zhang  et  al.  [5]  proposed  a  DCNN  including 
spectral  and  spatial  two  channels.  The    spectral  and  spatial 
features  of  HSI  are  extracted  by  the  one-dimensional 
convolutional 
convolutional 
respectively  in  DCNN.  The  DCNN  achieved  the  best 
classification  performances  on two  data  sets  compared  with 
other methods. Y. Chen et al. [6] designed a new CNN model 
with  regularization  based  on  the  3-D  convolutional  to  solve 
the HSI classification task and made a success on three data 
sets. Xu et al. [7] proposed a new architecture that integrating

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Y. Chen et al. [6] designed a new CNN model with regularization based on the 3-D convolutional to solve the HSI classification task. Regularization techniques commonly used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting, while L1 and L2 regularizations add penalties to the loss function to discourage large weights. Without further details, we cannot determine which specific regularization method was employed in the mentioned study.
