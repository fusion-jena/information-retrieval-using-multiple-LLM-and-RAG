Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Finally,  the  independent  variables  derived  are  matched  with  the 
response  variables  to  create  an  XGBoost  model.  The  SHAP  method  is 
then employed to interpret the calculations. The findings are visualized 
and analyzed through the ArcMap software.

2. Data and methodology 

2.1. Study area

Following 

The experiment utilized the pre-trained “ERNIE” model (https://gith 
ub.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE). 
a 
comparative  analysis  of  the  accuracy  of  Rostcm  6.0,  Simple  Bayesian 
Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-
tional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  in  pre-tests,  the  decision  was  made  to 
employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the use of the XGBoost model and the SHAP method that some form of monitoring or evaluation might have been done.

XGBoost is known for its high predictive power and efficiency, which makes it suitable for large datasets. It also provides built-in functions for cross-validation, early stopping, and regularization, which help prevent overfitting and improve model generalizability. These features could potentially serve as strategies to monitor the model performance during training.

Furthermore, the use of the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method suggests that feature importance and contribution were considered when interpreting the results. This method helps understand how each input variable contributes to the output, providing insights into the model behavior and performance.

However, without explicit details about the implementation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
