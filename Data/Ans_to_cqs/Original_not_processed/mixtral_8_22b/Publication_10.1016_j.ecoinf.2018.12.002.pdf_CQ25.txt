Brewster et al. (2018) applied six other supervised classiﬁers to classify
the behaviors of lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) at Bimini, Ba-
hamas using ACC data. This study will brieﬂy describe two popular
machine learning algorithms random forests and support vector ma-
chines for the introductory purpose.

to reduce the variance of the model without increasing its bias
(Breiman, 2001). Furthermore, support vector machines use determi-
nistic approaches to choosing points or support vectors to deﬁne the
boundary between classes. Although the deterministic approach may
reduce the computational cost and time, support vector machines are a
binary, one-vs-all-other classiﬁer. Support vector machines need to be
applied n times to a data set if there are n behavioral categories. The
high overall performance of random forests or ensemble machine
learning will allow us to understand the behavior of cryptic animals
using ACC data (Brewster et al., 2018; Ladds et al., 2017). Although
random forests are a leading machine learning algorithm with im-
pressive overall performance in behavioral classiﬁcation, random forest
and its derivatives may not perform consistently among all behavioral
categories (Brewster et al., 2018; Nathan et al., 2012). Therefore,

lack or shortage of behavioral observations limits the applications of
supervised learning in behavioral studies. Unsupervised learning is an
appropriate tool for explanatory studies of novel behaviors or beha-
vioral
secretive species or hardly observable species
(Brewster et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models but discusses various machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines. These algorithms have been used for the supervised learning of animal behavior based on accelerometer (ACC) data. Specifically, this study focuses on describing two popular machine learning algorithms - random forests and support vector machines - for introductory purposes. Random forests aim to reduce the variance of the model without increasing its bias, while support vector machines use deterministic approaches to choose points or support vectors to define boundaries between classes. However, it should be noted that support vector machines are binary, one-vs-all-other classifiers, requiring multiple applications to a dataset if there are numerous behavioral categories. Despite the high overall performance of random forests, they might not perform consistently across all behavioral categories. Due to the lack or shortage of behavioral observations, unsupervised learning becomes an appropriate tool for exploratory studies of novel behaviors or secretive species that are difficult to observe.

In summary, the purpose of these machine learning algorithms discussed in the given context is primarily for the classification of animal behavior based on accelerometer data. Deep learning models could potentially be employed for similar tasks, although the specific application (classification, segmentation, detection) would depend on the research objectives and available data.
