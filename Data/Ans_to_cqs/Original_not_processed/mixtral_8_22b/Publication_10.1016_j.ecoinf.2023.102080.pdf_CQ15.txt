Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

algorithms character vector with the name(s) of the 
algorithms(s) used for the embedding procedure;

include in the final set; maxncov value for the 
maximum possible number of covariates to include in 
the final set; nthreads value for the number of cores to 
be used during parallel operations

penalization (GAM-NP) (Marra and Wood, 2011), and guided regular-
ized RF (RF-GR) (Deng and Runger, 2013). These algorithms are doing 
covariate selection at the same time as model fitting, allowing to account 
early-on  for  the  specificities  of  the  algorithms  and  the  multivariate 
context. Furthermore, they have a more reasonable computational cost 
and  limit  overfitting  compared  to  dredging  or  wrapping  techniques, 
such as backward or forward selection strategies. Moreover, the three 
target algorithms are covering a gradient of fitting techniques (tree- and 
regression-based) and flexibility levels (GLM: parametric, GAM: semi- 
parametric, and RF: machine learning). A key benefit is that their co-
variate selection results are generalizable enough to be used as input for 
other popular SDM algorithms, such as Maxent (Phillips et al., 2006) or 
Gradient  Boosting  (Elith  et  al.,  2008),  even  if  they  are  not  directly 
included in the initial procedure.

Details on the R packages and hyperparameter values used for fitting 
these three algorithms are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text 
S1. The three algorithms can be used all together (default), in combi-
nations  of  two,  or  individually.  For  each  algorithm,  the  n  covariates 
retained after regularization are ranked from 1 (“best”) to n (“worst”). 
The algorithm-specific ranking is done based on the maximum absolute 
values of the regularized regression coefficients for GLM, the chi-square 
statistic for GAM, and the Mean Decrease Gini index for RF. The final 
ranking of covariates is obtained by ordering the sum of the ranks for 
each  covariate,  starting  with  the  covariates  that  were  commonly 
selected by all algorithms, and then adding the remaining ones. The top 
ncov covariates  are  selected as  the  final  modelling set, with  ncov and 
ncovmax being user-specifiable numbers. The default value for ncov is set

2. We introduce a two-step “embedded” covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-
dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional 
candidate covariate space. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with 
three  model-specific  embedded  regularization  techniques  (Step  B),  including  generalized  linear 
model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and 
guided regularized random forest.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears there is no mention of any deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the text discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure designed to improve predictive abilities and parsimony of species distribution models within a high-dimensional candidate covariate space. This process involves combining a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (Step B): Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization, Generalized Additive Model with Null-Space Penalization, and Guided Regularized Random Forest. Therefore, I cannot provide information regarding optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline since this topic isn't covered in the provided context.
