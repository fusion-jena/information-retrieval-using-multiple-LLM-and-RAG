In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other frameworks were utilized for this purpose.
