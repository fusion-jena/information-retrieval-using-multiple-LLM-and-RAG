2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

Though the original architecture of Koch et al., (2015) used
regularized cross entropy as a loss function, better performance may
be achieved with other loss functions instead of cross entropy, as
mentioned by Wang and Deng, (2021). Contrastive loss takes as input
a pair of samples that are either similar or dissimilar, and brings
similar samples closer and dissimilar samples far apart. It is, there-
fore, a better choice for learning a metric. Contrastive loss has been
successfully used recently in several papers in machine learning as
well as with Siamese networks and outstanding results have been
reported for using it even in unsupervised contrastive learning (see e.
g., (Aruna Gladys and Vetriselvi, 2023; Choi and Kim, 2022; He et al.,
2019; Huang et al., 2019; Lian et al., 2018; Melekhov et al., 2016;

The training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each
having 4 different 320 × 320 pixels images. The test size included 99
other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set.
Images of both training and test sizes varied in their poses and other
image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc. The initial ex-
periments referred to the following issues to be decided for the chosen
framework:

1. Architecture: We examined two Siamese architectures versions
based on the work of (Koch et al., 2015), since Siamese networks that
learn a similarity function are a better choice for learning with a
small example set.13 The two architectures have either 2 or 4
convolution layers with Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL)
as a loss function. The implementations are taken from the open
sources of Choi, (2020); Siyah, (2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, various measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was diverse, consisting of 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 × 320 pixels images. This diversity helped in capturing variations within the same class, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize. Secondly, the test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. This allowed the model to be tested on new instances of known classes, further validating its generalization capabilities. Lastly, the images in both the training and test sets varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc. This variation in the dataset helped the model to learn robust features that can handle real-world variabilities, thus enhancing its generalizability. However, specific methods like cross-validation or stratified splitting do not appear to be explicitly mentioned in the given context.
