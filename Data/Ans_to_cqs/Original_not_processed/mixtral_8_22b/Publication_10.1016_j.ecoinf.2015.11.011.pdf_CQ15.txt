Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.3. Pre-processing of imagery

For the 2009 NAIP imagery, we calculated a per-pixel Normalized Differ-
ence Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer using ArcGIS's Raster Calculator to
use in segmentation.

2.4. Segmentation and classiÔ¨Åcation

the histogram of values for the band in question for breakpoints
in order to choose thresholds. Different bands were helpful for
segmenting and classifying different images. For 2009 NAIP images,
NDVI as well as mean values of different bands (e.g., green, infra-red),
or overall image brightness were often helpful (and for one site, Bald
Hills, per-pixel texture variables calculated for the red band in addition
to the image bands and NDVI were needed in order to discriminate
between classes); for historical imagery the image brightness value
worked well, in addition to contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity and
second moment (see Supplementary data for example eCognition rule
sets).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). The text discusses pre-processing steps for imagery, including calculating a per-pixel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer, and segmentation and classification methods for different types of images. However, it does not mention any details about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques used within them.
