specimens of the native species (~ 3200) from the alien species (~ 800). 
The specimens of alien species belonged to different categories such as 
cultivated, casual, naturalised and invasive. Only the specimens of those

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which specific optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. The context does not provide any information about the methodology or tools used for data analysis, including whether machine learning or deep learning models were employed. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to the query regarding the use of optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) in this case.

Answer:::

I apologize for the inconvenience, but based on the provided context, there is no information available to address the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
