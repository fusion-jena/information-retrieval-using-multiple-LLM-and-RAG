The  automated  classification  of  migrating  birds'  ftight  calls  has 
the  potential  to  yield  new  biologieal  insights  and  conservation  ap 
plications  for  birds  that  vocalize  during  migration.  In  this  paper 
we  explored  two  state-of-the-art classification  techniques  for large 
vocabulary  bird  species  classification  from  flight  calls:  a  "shallow 
learning" unsupervised dietionary learning  method and  a deep con 
volutional  neural  network  combined  with  data  augmentation.  The 
models  were evaluated on a dataset of 5428  ftight  calls from 43  dif 
ferent  species, and  were  compared  against  a  baseline  model  based 
on  MFCCs.  We  showed  that  the  two  models  perform  comparably, 
yielding  a  mean  classification  accuracy  of 0.94  and  significantly 
outperforming  the  MFCC  baseline  (0.85).  We  also  compared  the 
performance of the CNN model  with  and  without augmentation and

1.  INTRODUCTION

During training the model optimi zes cross-entropy loss via mini-
batch  stochastic  gradient descent  [26].  We  use  a constant learning 
rate  of 0.01  and  apply  dropout [27]  to  the  input of the  last two lay 
ers  with  probability 0.5.  L2-regularization  is  applied to  the  weights 
of the last two layers  with  a penalty  factor  of 0.001.  The  model  is 
trained for  100 epochs and is  checkpointed after each epoch.  A val 
idation  set  is  used to  identify  the  parameter setting  (epoch)  achiev 
ing the  highest classification accuracy.  The CNN is  implemented  in 
Python using Lasagne [28] , and data stream  multiplexing (for train 
ing)  is implemented using Pescador [29].

Automated c1assification of organisms to  species based on  their vo 
calizations  would  contribute  tremendously  to  abilities  to  monitor 
biodiversity, with a wide range of applications in the field of ecology. 
In  particular, automated c1assification of migrating birds'  flight calls 
could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for 
birds that vocalize during  migration.  In this paper we explore state 
of-the-art c1assification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species 
c1assification  from  flight  calls.  In  particular, we contrast a "shallow 
learning"  approach  based on  unsupervised dictionary  learning with 
a deep convolutional  neural network combined with data augmenta 
tion.  We show that the two models perform comparably on a dataset 
of 5428  flight  calls spanning 43  different species, with  both  signifi 
cantly  outperforming an  MFCC  baseline.  Finally, we  show  that  by

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it aims to classify migrating birds' flight calls into different species. This is achieved through the use of a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. The performance of this model is then compared to a shallow learning approach based on unsupervised dictionary learning and an MFCC baseline.
