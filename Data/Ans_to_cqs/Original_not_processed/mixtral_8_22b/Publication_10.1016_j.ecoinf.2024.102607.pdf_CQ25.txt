In addition to selecting the RS imagery and representative training 
samples, the choice of machine learning (ML) algorithm directly affects 
the accuracy of the classification results. Currently, a wide range of ML 
algorithms are extensively employed in LULC mapping, including sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) (Adugna et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2017), 
random forests (RFs) (Svoboda et al., 2022), decision trees (DTs) (Shih 
et al., 2018), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Amani et al., 2020; 
Hu et al., 2021). Researchers have frequently compared the accuracies 
of LULC maps derived from different classifiers (Shih et al., 2021). The 
RF  classifier  outperformed  the  other  ML  classifiers,  as  confirmed  by 
LULC (Shih et al., 2018; Yuh et al., 2023) and crop mapping (Inglada 
et al., 2015). RF has lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and stronger 
robustness against noise (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). Furthermore, RF can

undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. This involves classifying different types of land use or land cover categories such as urban areas, forests, water bodies, agricultural lands, etc. The specific type of deep learning model mentioned here is the Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is known for its robustness against noise and lower sensitivity to tuning parameters. It has been shown to perform well in various applications related to LULC mapping, including crop mapping and undersampling techniques. Additionally, the text mentions the use of multiple probabilistic classification methods and space-spectrum arrays, suggesting that these might also play a role in the deep learning model's function.
