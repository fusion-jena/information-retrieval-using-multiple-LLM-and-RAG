As deep learning continues to flourish, a myriad of researchers has 
pivoted  their  focus  towards  animal  individual  recognition,  aiming  to 
gain  deeper  insights  into  animal  behavior,  growth  status,  and  more. 
However,  the  pursuit  of  animal  individual  recognition  necessitates  a 
substantial  dataset  of  animal  images,  and  acquiring  such  datasets  is 
often challenging. To overcome the hurdle of dataset collection, Ferreira 
et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously gathers training 
data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for their study on small bird individual recognition. This 
approach  alleviates  the  need  for  manual  annotation  and  independent 
neural network training.

in the realm of face recognition, these techniques have become capable 
of  precisely  capturing  the  facial  features  of  diverse  individuals  and 
conducting  accurate  comparisons  and  classifications  after  rigorous 
optimization with extensive training data. These advancements have led 
to  high-precision  and  real-time  face  recognition.  Consequently,  it’s 
plausible  to  assume  that  applying  such  cutting-edge  methods  to  fish 
species  recognition  could  yield  remarkable  results,  providing  a  non- 
invasive yet highly accurate alternative to traditional sampling methods. 
Zhang  et  al.  (2021)  integrated  the  Convolutional  Block  Attention 
Module  (CBAM)  seamlessly  with  the  You  Only  Look  Once  version  4 
(YOLOv4) algorithm. The aim was to enhance the accuracy of individual 
fish recognition by strategically directing the model’s focus towards the 
fish body. While this approach indeed improved recognition efficiency,
