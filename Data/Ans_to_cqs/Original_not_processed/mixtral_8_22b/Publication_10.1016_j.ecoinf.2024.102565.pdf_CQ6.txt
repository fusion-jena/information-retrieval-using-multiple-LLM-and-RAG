NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers. For example, if there are missing values in the dataset, they can be filled by mean, median, mode, or other statistical methods. Outliers can also be removed or replaced based on domain knowledge.

2. Normalization: Deep learning models often require normalized inputs to ensure that all features have similar scales. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and log transformation. Min-max scaling rescales the data to a fixed range, usually [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Z-score normalization standardizes the data to have zero mean and unit variance. Log transformation is useful when the data has a skewed distribution.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling ensures that all features have comparable magnitudes. However, unlike normalization, feature scaling does not change the shape of the distribution. Common feature scaling techniques include standardization and normalization. Standardization scales the data to have zero mean and unit variance, whereas normalization scales the data to a fixed range.

4. Encoding: When working with categorical variables, it is necessary to convert them into numerical representations. One popular encoding method is one-hot encoding, which creates binary vectors for each category. Another method is label encoding, which assigns unique integers to each category.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: High dimensional datasets can pose challenges for deep learning models due to the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of the data can improve performance and reduce computational complexity. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can be used for dimensionality reduction.

In summary, preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, feature scaling, encoding, and dimensionality reduction are commonly employed before training a deep learning model. These steps help to prepare the data for optimal performance and prevent potential issues such as overfitting and poor generalization.
