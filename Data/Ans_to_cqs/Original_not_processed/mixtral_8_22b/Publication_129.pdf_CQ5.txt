3.2. Faster R-CNN approach

The Faster R-CNN presents recent advancement of both Fast
R-CNN and R-CNN by Ren et al. [16]. It merges a Region
Proposal Network (RPN) as object bounds predictor and Fast
R-CNN for target detection in processed images. The role of
RPN module is to serve as the ‘‘attention” mechanism of this
uniﬁed Faster R-CNN, as depicted in Fig. 2. Three basic com-
ponents of the Faster R-CNN can be described as follow.
First, the feature extractor network to generate feature maps

from the input image (see Fig. 2). It can be a pre-trained
CNN architecture such as Inception [32], Residual Neural Net-
work (Resnet) [33], and Dense Convolutional Network (Den-
senet)
the RPN module proposes object
locations of the feature maps. Third, a regressor and classiﬁer
are trained using the loss function L in (1) for the CNN detec-
tion network to adjust these proposed locations and to predict
single or multi-object classes with the corresponding bounding
box area in the resulted image, as shown in Fig. 2.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, it appears that there are no specific mentions of any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, reference [19] does mention the use of a large-scale benchmark dataset called IP102 for insect pest recognition. Additionally, reference [21] discusses the use of internal databases for pest detection and identification on tomato plants. Therefore, while we cannot provide information about widely known datasets, we do have some insight into custom or specialized datasets used in certain applications related to agriculture and pest management.
