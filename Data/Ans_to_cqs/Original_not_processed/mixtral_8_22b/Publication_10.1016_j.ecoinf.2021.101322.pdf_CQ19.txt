Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.3. Implementation and training 

The  CNN  was  implemented  using  the  Keras  (Chollet,  2015)  and 
TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.,  2016)  software  packages  implemented  in 
Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and 
CuDNN  with  Nvidia  (Nvidia  Corp.,  Santa  Clara,  California)  P100 
accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. We used a Keras imple-
mentation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 (https://github. 
com/qubvel/efficientnet).  The  pre-trained  weights  used  for  transfer 
learning were available through this API.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The convolutional neural network (CNN) is built using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python. These frameworks provide tools for building and training deep learning models, including CNNs. In addition, computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. This setup allows for efficient processing of large datasets and complex computations required for deep learning tasks.
