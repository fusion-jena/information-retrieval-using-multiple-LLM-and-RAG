Table 3 
The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a MaxEnt model for its analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of this model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Nevertheless, some aspects of the methodology suggest efforts towards ensuring the robustness and reliability of the results. For instance, the use of a 30 random test percentage implies that the model was tested on different subsets of the data, which could be seen as a form of cross-validation. Additionally, the fact that the output was analyzed after running the model multiple times (10 replicate runs) also contributes to the reliability of the findings.

However, without more detailed information about the dataset used and the exact process of model validation, it is not possible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
