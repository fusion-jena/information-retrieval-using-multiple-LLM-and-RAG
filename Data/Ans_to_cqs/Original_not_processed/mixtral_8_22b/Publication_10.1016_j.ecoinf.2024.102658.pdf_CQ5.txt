Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Table 1 
The list of features. We utilize two feature sets selected through different CV 
processes  in  a  previous  study  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024),  which  we  name  the 
‘random-CV’ feature set and the ‘spatial-CV’ feature set, respectively. The two 
feature sets share six common features.

amount  of  data,  distribution  data  for  machine  learning  models  and 
physiological data for process-based models. For both types of models, 
the  data  is  difficult  and  costly  to  collect.  This  poses  a  bottleneck  for 
building SDMs for practical use.

3. The study area and data

3.2. Climate datasets 

The  climate  data  used  in  this  study  comprises  the  27  climate  ex-
tremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection 
and Indices (ETCCDI), and the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim 
(Hijmans  et  al.,  2005).  For  both  sets  of  climatic  variables,  we  chose 
observational and simulation data averaged for the years 1950–2000 to 
represent the present-day climate, and simulation data averaged for the 
years  2061–2080  to  represent  the  expected  climate  in  approximately 
2070. 

We use present-day and future ETCCDI indices derived from results 
of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) (Gent et al., 
2011),  one  of  a  number  of  Coupled  Model  Intercomparison  Project 
Phase  5  (CMIP5)  global  climate  models  for  which  these  indices  were

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the study uses climate data comprising the 27 climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. These datasets are used to build species distribution models (SDMs) using machine learning techniques. Therefore, the datasets used in this study are related to climate data rather than commonly used image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
