relatively smooth T error curve and was more stable and better
performing than the BPNN prediction model, even in when se-
lecting diﬀerent hidden layer nodes. In addition, the SVM model
converges faster with less learning time than the BPNN during the
evaluation process.

1995). Therefore, in this paper, the comparison between the BPNN
model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

after individual trials from BPNN2-1 (insuﬃcient ﬁtting ability) to
BPNN7-1 (overﬁtting and unstable), BPNN4-1 oﬀers the lowest mean
square error and the most 17 stable average performance at 0.000694,
with a maximum allowable training time of 1000. We choose an
adaptive strategy to modulate the learning rate to improve the neural
network convergence rate. The results show a benchmark learning rate
of 0.01, a learning rate up to 1.07 as the error steadily decreases, a
learning rate down to 0.70 as the error increases, a limit of the training

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it mentions some metrics related to the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models. These include absolute error, relative error, root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation, and learning time.

In general, common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Area Under Curve (AUC), confusion matrix, and log loss. Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall shows the fraction of relevant instances retrieved out of all relevant instances. F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric using their harmonic mean. AUC represents the degree or measure of separability, while confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the classification performance. Log loss quantifies the uncertainty of the classifier regarding its decision.

However, without additional context or information, we cannot determine if these commonly used deep learning evaluation metrics were applied to the models discussed in the provided text.
