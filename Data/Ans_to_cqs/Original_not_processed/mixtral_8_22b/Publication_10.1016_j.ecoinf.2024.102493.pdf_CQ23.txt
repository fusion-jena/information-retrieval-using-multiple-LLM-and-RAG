where Q represents the explanatory power of each driver factor on the 
spatial variability of the kNDVI, with values ranging between [0,1]. A 
higher Q value indicates a stronger ability of the influencing factor to 
explain the kNDVI, and vice versa(Wang and Xu, 2017). L denotes the 
number  of  strata  for  each  driver  factor,  and  Nh  and  N  represent  the 
sample size of each driver factor within stratum h and the entire region, 
respectively. σ2and σ2
h  represent the total variance in the whole region 
and the variance in the kNDVI in the h-th stratum, respectively. SSW and 
SST represent the square sum of the kNDVI within stratum h and the 
square sum across the entire region, respectively.

The Q value, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver in 
the OPGD, is also influenced by the size of the OPGD data sampling grid. 
It is common to compare the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers 
at different spatial scales and select the optimal sampling grid based on 
the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest(Song et al., 2020; Yu 
et al., 2023). In this paper, Q values for each driver were compared at 
grid scales of 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km, 3 km*3 km, 4 km*4 km, 5 km*5 
km and 6 km*6 km.

The factor detector assesses the independent explanatory power of 
each driver in relation to the spatial variance in the kNDVI using the Q

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The authors do not provide explicit information regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they mention using a diverse dataset from multiple sources, including remote sensing images, meteorological data, soil data, and land use/cover data. They also discuss employing a multi-scale analysis approach, comparing Q values for each driver at various grid scales. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been used during the development and evaluation of their model. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about their methodology, it cannot be confirmed whether these techniques were indeed applied.
