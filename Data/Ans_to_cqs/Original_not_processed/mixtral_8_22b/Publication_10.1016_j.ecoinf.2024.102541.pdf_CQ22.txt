Understanding  the  computational  cost  and  parameters  of  a  single 
layer allows for precise estimation and control of the total requirements 
of our model. Computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, calcu-
lated considering the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input 
Cin  and output Cout  channels, and the feature map’s height (hout) and 
width  (wout).  FPS  measure  the  model’s  speed,  encompassing  pre-
processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing 
an overall assessment of the model’s efficiency in real-time applications. 

4.4. Results

tionally, our technique is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and from the baseline model we 
recorded  a  17.65%  increase  in  FPS,  28.55%  model  parameters  reduction,  and  50.92%  in  FLOPs  reduction. 
Furthermore, our model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas. This 
enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware, aiding conservation efforts through rapid analysis. The 
model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance.

A higher AP value indicates improved accuracy across various object 
classes. Specifically, AP0.5:0.95  represents the AP calculated over an IoU 
range from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05, while AP0.5 refers to the AP 
at a 50%IoU threshold. The mAP is defined as the mean of all AP values, 
as detailed in Eq. (13). For computational analysis, Eq. (14) presents the 
FLOPs  for  a  single  convolutional  layer,  and  Eq.  (15)  outlines  the 
parameter count for the same.

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model. These include precision, average precision (AP), mean Average Precision (mAP), and Intersection over Union (IoU).

Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions made by the model relative to the total number of positive predictions made. A higher precision value indicates fewer false positives, meaning the model is better at correctly identifying objects within its class.

Average precision (AP) is a metric that summarizes the precision-recall curve into a single value. It calculates the area under the precision-recall curve, where a larger area corresponds to a more accurate model. In this study, two types of AP are reported: AP0.5 and AP0.5:0.95. AP0.5 represents the AP calculated at a 50% IoU threshold, while AP0.5:0.95 represents the AP calculated over an IoU range from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.

Mean Average Precision (mAP) is another metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. It is defined as the mean of all AP values, as shown in Equation (13).

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric used to determine how well the predicted bounding box matches the ground truth bounding box. It is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes to the union area between them. A higher IoU value indicates a better match between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.

Overall, these metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
