4.3.1. Data description

4.2. Experimental setup 

During the training phase, to accommodate multivariate input and 
univariate output, the input and output dimensions of the encoder and 
decoder  are set  to the  number of variables  in the  dataset. The model 
dimensionality  is  set  to  128  to  achieve  a  balance  between  model 
complexity  and  computational  efficiency.  Additionally,  the  model  in-
tegrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel in-
formation flows. The model architecture includes two layers of encoders 
and one layer of decoders, which help to comprehensively capture fea-
tures from time series data. To reduce the risk of overfitting, a dropout 

4.3.2. Results for the Shandong peninsula

This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset was divided into three parts: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. However, it does not provide any details about the source or location of the dataset. Therefore, based on the given information, I do not have enough knowledge to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
