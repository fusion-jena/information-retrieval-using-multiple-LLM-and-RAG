overall process mostly followed current best practices in deep learning 
which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017).

diversify  the  training  data,  and  the  3-s  window  length  enables  the 
implementation of this data augmentation method.

Table 1 
Our  model  design  follows  the  Wide  ResNet  approach  by  Zagoruyko  and 
Komodakis and consists of 157 layers, of which 36 are weighted.

followed  the  original  Wide  ResNet  design.  Our  downsampling  blocks 
employed the changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). The third and final 
component, the classification block, was derived from (Schlüter, 2018) 
and resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second (i. 
e., three predictions per 3-s input spectrogram) followed by global log- 
mean-exponential  pooling  and  sigmoid  activation.  Most  convolutions 
use 3 × 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normali-
zation  (Ioffe  and  Szegedy,  2015)  and  ReLU  activation  (if  not  noted 
differently).  Because  we  treated  spectrograms  as  monochrome  input 
images, the input was a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, 
visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, as outlined in Chollet (2017), ensuring that the model adheres to established standards. Secondly, efforts were made to diversify the training data. This is crucial because diverse datasets help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Additionally, the use of a 3-second window length enabled the implementation of a data augmentation method, further enhancing the diversity of the training data. Data augmentation techniques can significantly increase the amount of available training data and improve the model's performance on new data. Lastly, while there isn't explicit mention of using cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods could have been employed during the development phase to evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune its parameters. However, without specific information regarding their usage, it cannot be confirmed if they were part of the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
