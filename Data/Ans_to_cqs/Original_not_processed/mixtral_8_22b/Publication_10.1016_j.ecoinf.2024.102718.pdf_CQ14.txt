and efficient. Our optimized model with relatively lower number of
parameters appears to be beneficial for such applications, successfully
working across multiple crops and a vast diversity of plant diseases.

7. Discussion

In the BEiT model architecture, our initial steps involve loading the
BEiT model and strategically freezing a substantial portion of its layers
approximately 7 of the total layers. By doing so, the model freezes the
weights in these layers, focusing the training process on fine-tuning the
remaining layers. The model is then derived by isolating the output of a
specific layer (‘out_ln’) from the BEiT architecture. To enhance training

Additionally, S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. proposed the CAHA-
AXRNet approach, a novel rice plant disease detection method opti-
mizing hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hum-
mingbird algorithm. This approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.1%
when evaluating three types of disease detection datasets, namely the
rice plant dataset, rice leaf dataset, and rice disease dataset (Sankar-
eshwaran et al., 2023). M. Sharma et al. introduced a novel structure
called DeepBatch, which utilized deep learning-based segmentation
with bitwise logical and operation to diagnose rice-infected leaves. This
approach demonstrated a substantial enhancement in performance
when compared to traditional methods, particularly in the identification
of rice diseases (Sharma et al., 2023b).

H. Yang et al. proposed the dense higher-level composition detection
transformer (DHLC-DETR) specifically for identifying rice diseases. The

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the BEiT model were optimized. However, it mentions that the CAHA-AXRNet approach proposed by S.P. Sankareshwaran et al. uses the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm to optimize hyperparameters. Unfortunately, there is no further explanation or details given regarding this optimization technique.
