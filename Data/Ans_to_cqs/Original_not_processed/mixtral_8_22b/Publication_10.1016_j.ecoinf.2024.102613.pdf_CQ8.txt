The presented reference architectures are designed to adapt to the 
dynamic nature of smart farming. Given the evolving nature of smart 
farming technologies, flexibility is essential to integrate new features, 
handle  increasing  data  complexity,  and  incorporate  modules  from 
various sources. Supplementary literature, such as software requirement 
specifications (SRS) documents, vendor websites, and other grey liter-
ature, may introduce new functionalities and modules to enhance the 
proposed architecture. 

To address data complexity, our reference architecture incorporates 
several big data features, including data lakes, NoSQL databases, and 
distributed databases. Additionally, data is highlighted as a mandatory 
feature  in  the  feature  diagram  to  emphasize  its  significance  in  data 
management.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the cited references provide details about the specific location or URL of the code repository. It would be necessary to consult additional resources or contact the authors directly to find out more about the availability of the code repository.
