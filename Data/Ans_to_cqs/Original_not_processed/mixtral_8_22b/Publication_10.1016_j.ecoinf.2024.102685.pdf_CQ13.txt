Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on statistical analysis using random forest classification and references various studies related to marine ecosystems. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available context.
