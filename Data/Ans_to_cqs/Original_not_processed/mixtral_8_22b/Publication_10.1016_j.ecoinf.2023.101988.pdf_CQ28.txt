%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by Chalmers et al. (2021). Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer based solely on this context.
