and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

1995). Therefore, in this paper, the comparison between the BPNN
model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the text that deep learning algorithms are used to extract deeply hidden characteristic information and features beyond what was previously possible with traditional neural networks. This suggests that deep learning models may be used for tasks such as image or speech recognition, natural language processing, or other complex pattern recognition problems where identifying subtle patterns or relationships in the input data is important. Additionally, the fact that these models can handle a larger number of layers than traditional neural networks implies that they may be particularly well-suited for handling high-dimensional data or very complex problems. Without further context, however, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose of any particular deep learning model mentioned in the passage.
