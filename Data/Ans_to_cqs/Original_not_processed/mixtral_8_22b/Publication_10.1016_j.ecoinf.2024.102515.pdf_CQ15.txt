DIVERSIMAR project (@diversimar). This helped us to understand how 
users expressed themselves in this social network. Although many of the 
tweets turned out to be very specific, it was possible to identify three 
fairly common ways of expressing that something interesting had been 
found. Therefore, we decided to perform the tweet search through the 
API  with  three  different  criteria:  (i)  tweets  in  which  users  ask  “who 
knows” or if “anyone knows” what they have found (query 1), (ii) tweets 
that directly ask “what is this” that they have found (query 2) and (iii) 
tweets  from  users  claiming  to  have  found  something,  with  textual 
expression as “I/we have found” (query 3). Different verb tenses were 
also used in each of the expressions, as well as the use of first person in 
both  singular  and  plural.  In  addition,  the  different  criteria  must  be 
accompanied by one of the following words to ensure that they refer to

In this study we have used the ‘Full-archive search endpoint’ to ac-
cess  the  entire  dataset  published  on  Twitter  from  its  beginning  in 
2006–2007 until the end of 2022. To handle the data in JSON format 
returned  by  the  Twitter  API,  we  used  the  twarc2  library  (https:// 
twarc-project.readthedocs.io/).  This  library  simplifies  the  handling  of 
the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API, as well as the pagination 
resulting from a single query. 

The API works by searching for words, hashtags or combinations of 
both  in  the  text  of  tweets,  much  like  the  Twitter  Advanced  Search 
interface  (https://twitter.com/search-advanced?).  To  find  out  how  to 
run the search, in an initial phase of the study, some public tweets with 
observations  were  provided  by  the  social  media  manager  of  the

(INDITIC Consortium, 2023). This kind of initiatives would benefit of 
the implementation of the current methodology to reduce human effort. 
Although the usefulness of this methodology has been proven, there 
are still certain limitations that cannot be ignored. The main one cor-
responds to the nature of the tweets themselves, with a low number of 
words  accompanying  the  messages,  not  always  well  written,  which 
makes  it  difficult  to  obtain  useful  information.  This  leads  to  a  high 
number of tweets being lost in the filtering process. Furthermore, using 
exclusively textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset 
would  only  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  deficient  model.  In  addition, 
biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their 
location, allowing, among other applications, to alert about the presence 
of  invasive  species  or  reuse  the  information  in  species  distribution

The  information  retrieved  from  this  social  network,  as  a  general 
characteristic to big data, are defined by a large volume of data and a 
large heterogeneity that requires cleaning and filtering processes that 
allow  focusing  on  relevant  data  (Poorthuis  and  Zook,  2017).  Fig.  1 
shows  a  flowchart  of  the  data  acquisition  and  processing  in  order  to 
reduce  invalid  tweets.  After  the  acquisition  of  original  tweets  (not 
retweets), a first filter consists in eliminating those tweets that contain 
images in GIF format and that in most cases corresponds to memes (http

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, I am unable to provide a direct answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, I can discuss the methods used in the context of analyzing tweets related to biodiversity observations.

In this study, the researchers utilized the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter since its inception in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. They employed the twarc2 library to manage the returned data in JSON format, which simplified handling the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API and the resulting pagination from a single query.

To extract relevant tweets, the researchers searched for specific keywords, hashtags, or combinations of both within the text of tweets. They identified three common ways users expressed finding something interesting: (i) asking who knows or if anyone knows about their findings, (ii) directly asking what they found, and (iii) stating that they found something. Different verb tenses and first-person singular or plural were also considered.

After acquiring the original tweets, a series of filters were applied to eliminate irrelevant content. First, tweets containing images in GIF format, often corresponding to memes, were removed. Next, tweets without geolocation metadata were discarded, as location information is crucial for understanding biodiversity observations. Lastly, tweets with URLs pointing to external websites were filtered out, as these links could potentially introduce noise into the analysis.

While the context does not explicitly mention optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it provides valuable insights into the methods employed for analyzing tweets related to biodiversity observations.
