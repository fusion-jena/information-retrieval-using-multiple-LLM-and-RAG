In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

2.1. Study area and species 

The  study  area  comprised  regions  in  Wonju,  Gangwon  Province, 
South Korea, where land cover was transformed from agricultural and 
commercial zones in 2013 to urban development zones in 2020 (Fig. 2). 
The study area was defined as a 14 × 14 km2 region, with an emphasis 
on  areas  experiencing  rapid  growth  in  residential  zones,  such  as 
Myeongnyun-dong, Gae-dong, and Won-won-dong. Located at the heart 
of the former city center, the study area serves as a crucial ecological 
network  for  the  vital  ecological  axes  of  the  Chiaksan  (1288  m)  and 
Baekunsan Mountains (893 m), which are situated beyond Wonju City’s 
forests.  Furthermore,  the  focus  area  is  ecologically  significant  as  it  is 
home  to  endangered  wildlife  species  and  comprises  a  significant  pro-
portion of the biotope map level 1 and 2 regions.
