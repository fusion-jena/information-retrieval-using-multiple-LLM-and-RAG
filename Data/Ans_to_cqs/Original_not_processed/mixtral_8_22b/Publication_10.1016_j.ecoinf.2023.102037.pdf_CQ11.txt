2021a; Wang et al., 2020c). Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained 
a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 (Red-
mon  and  Farhadi,  2018)  while  detecting  and  classifying  pest  species 
from  the  images  in  their  “Pest24”  dataset.  The  dataset  consisted  of 
25,378  annotated  images  coming  from  24  pest  species  that  were  all 
collected by an automatic imaging trap. Rustia et al. (2021) designed a 
multi-stage deep learning method including object detection, insect vs. 
non-insect  separation  and  a  multi-class  insect  classification  for  insect 
identification. Data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices 
installed  in  greenhouses  –  under  varying  lighting environments  -  and 
their classification model reached average F1-scores of up to 0.92. Hong 
et  al.  (2021)  developed  an  AI-based  pest  counting  method  for  moni-
toring  the  black  pine  bast  scale  (M.  thungergianae)  which  reached  a

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of any deep learning pipeline used for pest identification or classification. However, it mentions several studies that have utilized various datasets for this purpose. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) used the "Pest24" dataset consisting of 25,378 annotated images from 24 pest species collected by an automatic imaging trap. Similarly, Rustia et al. (2021) employed data acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting conditions. Unfortunately, none of these sources mention a specific data repository link where these datasets are publicly available. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context.
