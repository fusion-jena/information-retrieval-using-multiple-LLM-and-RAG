over which the quality measures and results fail to continue improving. 
Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzing the effect of sample size on 
deep neural networks, similarly concluded that by increasing the num-
ber of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training 
recordings in our software, the neural network can largely improve the 
performance of the model.

All the parameters used for all the recognizers are shown in Table S2. 

2.6. Data analysis: Target set 

The analyses of the target set aimed to detect possible differences 
among the software programs in evaluating the results with regard to 
two different aspects: (1) the possibility that different habitats produce 
more or fewer song detections per day and (2) the possibility that great 
tits in different habitats have different times of vocal activity, regardless 
of the total number of songs. Given that the days and sites used to obtain 
the  data  for  the  training  and  target  sets  were  the  same  for  all  three 
software programs, any differences among the software programs must 
be exclusively due to differences or biases in their detection patterns. On 
the other hand, for the general comparison of the software, we measured 
the  time  each  software  spent  on  analyzing  the  entire  target  dataset 
(32,640 recordings).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using a diverse dataset from various habitats and comparing the performance of multiple software programs. This suggests some level of robustness testing. Additionally, the study uses a large target dataset consisting of 32,640 recordings, which could contribute to the model's ability to generalize well. Nevertheless, without clear details regarding techniques such as cross-validation, stratified sampling, or other methods commonly employed to enhance model generalization, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were specifically taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
