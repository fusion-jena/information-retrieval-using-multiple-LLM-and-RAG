over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for such purposes. These include conducting surveys or interviews, using sensors or IoT devices, accessing publicly available datasets, scraping websites, utilizing APIs, and more. The choice of method depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the type of data required. For instance, if the task is image recognition, then images could be collected through cameras or downloaded from online databases. Similarly, for natural language processing tasks, textual data might be gathered via web scraping or social media platforms. It should also be noted that the quality and quantity of data play crucial roles in training effective deep learning models. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the chosen data collection method provides sufficient and relevant data.
