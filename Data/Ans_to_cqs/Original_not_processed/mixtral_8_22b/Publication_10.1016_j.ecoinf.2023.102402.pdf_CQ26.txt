(0.336–0.665), and good (0.666–1).

ORACLE values are averaged over 14 years (2000 to 2014). The data 
are  available  for  global-scale  applications  at  a  spatial  resolution  of  5 
arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator). As seahorses are benthic 
animals (Correia et al., 2018), we chose our predictors from the avail-
able  benthic  layers.  The  benthic  layers  were  produced  with  an  inter-
polation  process  that  considers  the  geographic  position  and  depth  of 
cells, as inferred from a bathymetric layer. The downscaling process for 
benthic layers considered the geo-graphical position and depth of cells 
as inferred from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans (GEBCO). 
Given that focal cells included a range of depth values, the benthic layers 
were  produced  for  the  minimum,  average,  and  maximum  depths  of 
GEBCO.  The  current  gridded  bathymetric  data  set,  the  GEBCO_2023 
Grid, is a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation

lative) and complex (interpolative) and may be considered an excellent 
method  to  cope  with  imbalanced-biased  data  in  species  distribution 
modelling approaches (Ahmadi et al., 2023). An important issue in the 
modelling procedure concerns the use of a single algorithm model, such 
as Maxent, or an ensemble model, such as Biomod2 (Thuiller et al., n.d.) 
or sdm (Naimi and Araujo, 2016), but it has been widely demonstrated 
that  there  is  no  significant  difference  between  using  ensembles  and 
single algorithm models (e.g., Hao et al., 2020; Kaky et al., 2020). The 
most impactful step on the reliability of species predictions remains a 
scrupulous  parameter  selection  (Morales  et  al.,  2017;  Zhu  and  Qiao, 
2016).  For  this  reason,  we  used  the  R  package  ENMeval  (Muscarella 
et al., 2014) to detect the optimal Maxent setting for modelling current

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they mention some relevant concepts related to handling imbalanced datasets in species distribution modeling.

In the context of these studies, one common approach to dealing with imbalanced data is using machine learning algorithms like Maxent, which can handle imbalanced datasets effectively. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the R package ENMeval to detect the optimal Maxent settings for modeling current distributions. This suggests that careful parameter selection plays a crucial role in improving the reliability of species predictions when working with imbalanced data.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, other commonly used techniques for addressing data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods aim to balance the dataset by either increasing the number of underrepresented samples or reducing the number of overrepresented ones. Stratified sampling ensures that each class is represented proportionally in the training and testing sets. In contrast, oversampling involves duplicating minority class examples, while undersampling removes majority class instances. Collecting more diverse data can also help mitigate data bias by ensuring better representation of all classes in the dataset.
