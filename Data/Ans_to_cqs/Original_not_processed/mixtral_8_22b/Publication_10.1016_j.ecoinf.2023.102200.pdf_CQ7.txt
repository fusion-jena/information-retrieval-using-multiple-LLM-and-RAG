%Query
Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified by class labels. The typical ratios used are 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10% for training, testing, and validation, respectively. Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can also be employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the trained models.

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used without additional information.
