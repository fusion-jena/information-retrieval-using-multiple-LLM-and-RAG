we utilize 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness 
clusters for each species.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

value of fish is rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 indicates the best 
freshness quality, and1 denotes the worst. For instance, the best fresh-
ness  quality of the  eye is  characterized by convexity, clear  and shiny 
cornea and pupil, specific for fish species. The lowest quality is char-
acterized  by  a  very  concave  appearance,  a  very  cloudy  cornea,  gray 
pupils, and a lack of shine. The examination process involves observing 
the eyes, clear observation of the removed gills, confirming body mucus 
by touching the skin surface, dissecting the body to observe the meat, 
inhaling gases emitted by the body of the fish, and touching the meat 
surface to assess its texture (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). Fish that have undergone

Inspection of each fish generates assessment data from the first day to 
the eleventh day, as presented in Table 2. Every day, experts provide six 
parameter  values,  with  the  highest  and  lowest  values  being  9  and  1, 
respectively. For instance, in the case of the eyes, a value of 9 indicates a 
convex, shiny eyeball with a clear cornea and pupil. According to SNI 
2729â€“2013, this condition worsens with prolonged storage. On the other 
hand, a value of 1 indicates a very sunken, dull eyeball with a cloudy 
cornea and gray pupil. On the first day, the freshness value of all six 
parameters  was  9.  As  the  examination  day  progressed,  these  values 
gradually decreased, with the degree of deterioration varying for each 
species.  For  example,  the  freshness  value  of  Chanos  Chanos  decreases 
more rapidly. On the second day, the lowest freshness value reached by 
meat and smell was 6. On the fourth day, the freshness value further

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the use of any deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. This study primarily focuses on using machine learning techniques for clustering based on Euclidean distances to determine fish freshness classes. Therefore, it cannot be determined what hyperparameters were used in a deep learning model since no such model has been mentioned.
