Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Whatever the goal, our framework is highly flexible and can be adapted by tuning the species thresholds 
regulating the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage in an attempt to monitor biodiversity 
through big datasets where species are unidentified. To unclog the bottleneck of information extraction about 
organism forms, behaviors and sounds from massive digital data, machine learning algorithms, and particularly 
the last generation of deep learning algorithms, offer immense promises. Here we propose to help the users to 
control their error rates in ecology. This is a valuable addition to the ecologist’s toolkit towards a routine and 
robust analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors. With this control of error 
rate in the hands of users, Deep Learning Algorithms can be used for real applications, with acceptable and

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud were utilized based solely on the given information.
