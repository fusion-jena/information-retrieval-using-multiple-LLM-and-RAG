2.2. Data collection

org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102484. 

This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses remote sensing imagery based on the mention of "high-resolution remotely sensed imagery" in one of the cited sources (Huang et al., 2019). Additionally, the ArcGIS software is mentioned, which typically deals with geospatial data such as images or maps. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning pipeline likely involves image data. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
