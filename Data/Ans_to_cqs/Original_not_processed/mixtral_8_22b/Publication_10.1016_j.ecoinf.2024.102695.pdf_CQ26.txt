with  the  sparseness  and  imbalance  of  the  data,  these  characteristics 
impose greater requirements on Transformer prediction models.

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

2.2. Transformer 

Since its introduction by Vaswani and others in 2017 Vaswani et al. 
(2017), the Transformer model has led to a significant revolution in the 
field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key innovations of 
the  Transformer  is  the  self-attention  mechanism,  which  allows  the 
model  to  weigh  the  importance  of  different  parts  of  the  input  data 
differently.  The  core  self-attention  mechanism  is  represented  by  For-

Here,  Q,  K,  and  V  represent  the  query,  key,  and  value  matrices, 
respectively.  The  query  matrix  represents  the  current  word  or  token 
being processed, while the key and value matrices represent the entire 
̅̅̅̅̅
input sequence. The term 
dk
is a scaling factor used to normalize the 
dot products, where dk  is the dimensionality of the keys.

This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a learning rate of 0.0001 was used throughout the training process, along with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances processed per batch. Additionally, the dataset was divided chronologically into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy aims to simulate real-world scenarios and enhance the generalizability of the model. It can be inferred that this division might help mitigate any temporal biases present in the data. Furthermore, the implementation of an early stopping strategy prevents overfitting issues, contributing to addressing potential biases in the model.
