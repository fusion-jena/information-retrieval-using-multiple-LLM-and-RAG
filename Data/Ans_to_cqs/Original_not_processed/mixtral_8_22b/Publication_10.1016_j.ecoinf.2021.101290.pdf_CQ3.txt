Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Despite the advantages of computational ethology, most annotation 
is still done by hand or at least partly by hand (Goodwin et al., 2020). 
There are many reasons for this, such as lack of training in biology for 
engineers or in engineering for biologists (Egnor and Branson, 2016), 
but  mostly  we  are  lacking  standardisation  and  convergence  of  the 
methods. This means a system must be built specifically for one exper-
iment  with  little  reuse  in  other  setups,  making  full  automation  too 
expensive and cumbersome to be worth while.

Helpful Answer:
Although the given context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it discusses the use of machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence for automated annotation and analysis. These technologies often employ various data annotation techniques depending on the task requirements. For example, object recognition tasks may involve bounding box annotations, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. In contrast, text classification tasks might require sequence labeling or named entity recognition.

In the context provided, the authors propose using automatic annotation and analysis of data online while collecting it. They emphasize the need for high-quality data when leveraging these technologies. While the paper doesn't delve into the details of specific annotation techniques, it suggests that researchers can benefit from applying automated annotation methods to improve their workflows and enable real-time data analysis.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, Torch, Caffe, and deeplearning4j. These libraries provide tools and functionalities that support various data annotation techniques, including those mentioned earlier. Researchers can choose the appropriate technique based on their project needs and integrate them into their deep learning pipelines using these frameworks.
