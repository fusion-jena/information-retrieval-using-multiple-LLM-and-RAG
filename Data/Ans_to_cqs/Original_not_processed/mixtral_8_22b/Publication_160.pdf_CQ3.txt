each class was represented by 105 to 60,218 annotations.

4.1. Assessment of annotator reliability

We used the data from Beijbom et al. (2015) (see section 2.1) to
assess human annotator accuracy using F1-score (see section 5.2.1). For
each point, the ground truth was defined as the first identification by
the “host” expert. These results will be used to discuss our CNN clas-
sification performances.

details with corresponding accuracies.

This study sought to design and train an algorithm based on deep
CNN architectures, in order to identify a selection of coralligenous
species or their broader taxonomical group, and to assess the biodi-
versity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs. We designed a
custom methodology, drawing on state-of-the-art architectures and a
large database of annotated photographic quadrats. More specifically,
we performed the following analysis

(1) Assess human annotation error on a similar problem in order to

establish a baseline performance;

(2) Train simple CNNs on different patch sizes and build an ensemble
network in order to improve performances with multi-scale pre-
diction;

(3) Train a LR on deeply learned features from intermediate layers to

improve performances and calibrate the ensemble network;

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers utilized image annotations for training their convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is evident from the mention of datasets containing thousands of annotations, which were likely applied to images of coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical groups.

While the exact nature of these annotations isn't specified, they could have included various types such as bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding boxes involve outlining objects within an image with rectangles, while semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image according to its object category. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, where individual instances of objects are outlined and labeled separately.

In this case, considering the task involves identifying coralligenous species, it's plausible that the researchers employed either semantic segmentation or instance segmentation methods. These would allow them to accurately delineate and categorize the numerous organisms present in complex marine environments. Nonetheless, without further details, we cannot definitively determine the precise annotation technique used in this particular study.
