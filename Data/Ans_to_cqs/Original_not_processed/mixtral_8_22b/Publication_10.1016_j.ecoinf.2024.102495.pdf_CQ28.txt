In a CNN, a convolution layer performs convolution operations be-
tween the pixels on the input and several kernels or filters. The math-
ematical equation of the convolution process is as follows, where f is the 
input data and h is the kernel size. 

G[m, n] = (f *h)[m, n] =

h[j, k]f [m (cid:0)

of the FFT window, 1024. The feature extraction parameters that yielded 
the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase 
in optimizing the CNN deep learning model. The results of model opti-
mization  were  acquired  by  employing  identical  performance  metrics 
used in optimizing the feature extraction parameters (Fig. 13).
