For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

types of cutouts; one is called the general extent (GE), encompassing the 
total sum of the natural distribution areas of the four species, and the 
other is referred to as the specific extent (SE), restricted to the individual 
distribution  of  each  species.  To  crop  the  bioclimatic  layers,  we  used

Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the model's performance.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.

3. Feature Selection: This process involves selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. It helps reduce overfitting, improves accuracy by reducing noise and redundancy, and reduces training time.

4. Data Augmentation: In this step, new data is created from existing data using techniques such as cropping, padding, zooming, etc. This technique is particularly useful in image classification tasks where there is limited labeled data available.

5. Splitting Dataset into Training and Test Sets: Before training the model, the dataset is usually split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model while the test set is used to validate the trained model.

However, please note that not all these steps are always required. The choice of preprocessing steps depends on the nature of the problem, the type of data, and the requirements of the specific deep learning algorithm being used.
