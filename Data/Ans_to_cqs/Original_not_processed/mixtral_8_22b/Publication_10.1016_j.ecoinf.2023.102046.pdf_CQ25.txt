ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network model that uses skip 
connections,  which  made  it  possible  to  get  good  performance  with 
deeper models than was previously possible (He et al., 2015). Training 
deep neural networks can result in exploding gradients, and skip con-
nections  were  introduced  to  ameliorate  that  problem.  ResNet-50  was 
chosen  for  comparison  as  it  is  a  proven  CV  classification  model.  It  is 
commonly used and provides a well-performing baseline. 

Inception-V3  is  a  convolutional  neural  network  used  for  image 
classification, that has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer 
(Szegedy et al., 2015b). The Inception-V3 architecture is built on pre-
vious Inception models, with the aim of making the V3 computationally

For  few-shot  learning,  CLIP  (Contrastive  Language  Image  Pre- 
training)  is  a  combination  of  two  transformer  models  that  was 
recently introduced. It consists of a text encoder and an image encoder, 
and is trained using contrastive learning to allow the image encoder to 
learn  visual  concepts  through  natural  language  supervision  (Radford 
et al., 2021). The image encoder maps an image to a vector that can be 
considered a robust semantic feature representation of the image, which 
can transfer to diverse tasks and often perform competitively with fully 
supervised baselines in a zero-shot fashion, without the need for fine- 
tuning.  CLIP  was  trained  on  400  million  images  from  the  web  along 
with their captions. While these models have shown impressive perfor-
mance, they are not perfect and have, for example, shown limited zero- 
shot  performance  in  detecting  tumors  on  x-ray  images.  We  aim  to

The Inception-V3 model accepts images resized to (299, 299) pixels 
but ViT and ResNet resize to (224, 224) pixels. Dataset imbalance was 
dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. 
For the training we used AdamW optimizer for Hugging Face models, 
which is the default optimizer in the transformers library by Hugging-
Face. For Inception-V3, we used Adam since that was the optimizer used 
in  previous  work  (and  AdamW  is  not  available  in  Keras).  We  used  a

batch  size  of  16  examples  and  the  learning  rate  was  set  to  10

Inception we used a learning rate of 4 × 10

smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for image classification. Both ResNet-50 and Inception-V3 are convolutional neural network models designed for this task. ResNet-50 is known for its use of skip connections, which help improve performance in deeper models, while Inception-V3 includes an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer. Additionally, CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training) is another model mentioned, which also contributes to image classification by mapping images to vectors that represent robust semantic features. These models are used to classify images into different categories based on their learned representations.
