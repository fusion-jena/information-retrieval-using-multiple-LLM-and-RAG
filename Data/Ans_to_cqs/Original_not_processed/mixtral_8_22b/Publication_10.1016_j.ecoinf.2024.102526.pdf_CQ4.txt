Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the authors may have used some form of data augmentation during their research, but without explicit mention, we cannot confirm which specific techniques were employed. Therefore, further reading or consultation with the original source would be necessary to determine the exact data augmentation techniques used in this study.
