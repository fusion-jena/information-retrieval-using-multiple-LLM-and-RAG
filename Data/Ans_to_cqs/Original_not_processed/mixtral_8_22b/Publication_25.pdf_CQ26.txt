combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that there isn't specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention some strategies to overcome the issue of limited training data in deep learning applications, particularly in the field of remote sensing.

One strategy mentioned is combining labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which allows neural networks to learn generalized features on a larger set of training examples before being fine-tuned on a smaller number of high-quality annotations. Another technique discussed is self-supervised learning, where unsupervised methods are employed to generate training data that can then be utilized to train supervised models. This method was specifically applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification.

While these strategies do not directly address data bias, they aim to enhance the performance of deep learning algorithms when dealing with limited or scarce training data. To tackle data bias explicitly, one could consider employing various sampling techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or stratified splitting to ensure balanced representation across different classes within the dataset. Additionally, collecting diverse data can also help mitigate potential biases in the dataset.
