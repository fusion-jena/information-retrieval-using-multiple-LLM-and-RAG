denotes the average accuracy for all classes at an IoU threshold of 0.5. 
The  mAP50–95  represents  the  average  accuracy  across  all  classes  at 
different  IoU  thresholds,  spanning  from  0.5  to  0.95  in  increments  of 
0.05.  The  time  metric  is  calculated  by  summing  the  runtimes  for  the 
preprocessing  (Preprocess),  network  inference  (Inference),  and  post-
processing (NMS) stages. The corresponding formulas are as follows:

4. Discussion 

Real-time  detection  and  counting  of  pests  in  a  specific  area  are 
important  for  timely  pest  spotting  and  control.  This  work  helps  to 
quickly determine the distribution and quantity of pests in the current 
environment, not only by providing critical data for agricultural man-
agement but also by helping to optimize the use of pesticides, thereby 
preventing  unnecessary  pesticide  waste  and  environmental  pollution 
(Dhankhar and Kumar, 2023; Liu et al., 2021).

insect detection tasks, we choose the public dataset Pest_24_640 (Wang 
et al., 2020) for comparison with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, 
namely  YOLOv5  (Jocher,  2020),  YOLOv6  (Li  et  al.,  2022),  YOLOv7 
(Wang et al., 2023), and YOLOv8 (Jocher et al., 2023). 

Table 6 shows a comprehensive comparison between our YOLO_MRC 
model and four other excellent YOLO models. YOLO_MRC performs the 
best in terms of time, P, and model size and leads in R and mAP@0.5. 
Specifically,  YOLO_MRC  achieves  70.4%  accuracy  on the  pest_24_640 
dataset (Wang et al., 2020) with a model size of only 2.4 MB. It has the 
fastest  inference  speed,  taking  only  3.6  ms  per  image.  These

input into the model network for training.

Helpful Answer:

To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. In this case, the experimental results show that the Average Precision (AP) and mean Average Precision (mAP) are used to measure the accuracy of the object detection task. AP is defined as the area under the precision-recall curve, while mAP is the average AP over multiple Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95. Additionally, the time metric is used to calculate the runtime of preprocessing, network inference, and post-processing stages. Furthermore, the model size is considered when evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
