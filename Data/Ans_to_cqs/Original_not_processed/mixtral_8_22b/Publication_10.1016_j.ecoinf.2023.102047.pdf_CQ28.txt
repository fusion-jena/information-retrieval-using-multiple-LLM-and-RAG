On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

(of 94.5%) using the deep learning–based CNN model. Martin-Abadal 
et  al.  (Martin-Abadal  et  al.,  2018)  estimated  seagrass  meadows  by 
applying  an  encoder  decoder-based  model  (VGG16FCN8).  They  ach-
ieved a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81% on their dataset. 
Meanwhile,  Weidmann et  al.  (Weidmann et  al., 2019) found  that the 
deep  learning–based  DeepLabv3+ model  achieves  the  highest  perfor-
mance  (with  a  mean  intersection  over  union  (mIoU)  of  87.78%) 
compared  to  the  fully  convolutional  networks,  dilated  convolution 
networks (dilNets) and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset.
