Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data imbalance or bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method where the dataset is divided into different strata or groups, ensuring that each group has equal representation in both training and testing datasets. This helps maintain the original class distribution in the dataset.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one such popular technique used for oversampling.

Undersampling is another approach where examples from the majority class are removed randomly until they match the number of instances in the minority class. This can be useful when dealing with large datasets but might lead to loss of important information.

Lastly, collecting diverse data ensures that the model generalizes well across various scenarios and reduces any inherent biases present in the dataset. It also improves overall performance by providing more comprehensive coverage of possible input variations.
