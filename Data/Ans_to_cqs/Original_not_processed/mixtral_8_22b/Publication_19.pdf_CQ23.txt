C.  Results 

  As  Table  III  show  all  models  performed  reasonably  well 
with macro-F1 averages above 91%. Because the models are to 
be deployed on IoT edge devices, the size of each model is an 
important  consideration.  As  Table  III  shows 
the  best 
performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 
score of 0.93, and the smallest size of 175 MB.

A.  The TFLite Model 

The best trained Inception-V3 model was first converted to 
TensorFlow  Lite 
(https://www.tensorflow.org/lite).  The 
resulting model had a reduced size of 87 MB (from175MB), but 
the  accuracy  was  reduced  to  92%  (from  93%),  and  macro 
average F1-score was reduced to 0.90 (from 0.93). F1-score for 
all classes except ‘other’ remained above 0.92.  The F1-score 
of ‘other’ was reduced to 0.71 (from 0.79).   Table V and Fig. 
9 show the confusion  matrix  and ROC curves  for the TFLite 
model respectively showing the model was still very capable.

However, a number of issues need to be addressed further.  First 
the data is highly unbalanced, and therefore, using SMOTE [23] 
or  similar  data  balancing  techniques  may  help  improve  the 
results further.  Secondly, recent architectures like EfficientNet 
[19]  that  performed  well  in  creating  smaller  networks  can  be

EfficientNetB1 produced performance similar to Inception-V3

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the best performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 score of 0.93, which suggests that some form of validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the use of different neural network architectures such as MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 indicates that multiple approaches were explored to find the most suitable model for the task. It is also worth noting that the models were evaluated based on their accuracy and size, considering their deployment on IoT edge devices. Therefore, while the exact methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated, it appears that various strategies were employed to optimize its performance and suitability for practical applications.
