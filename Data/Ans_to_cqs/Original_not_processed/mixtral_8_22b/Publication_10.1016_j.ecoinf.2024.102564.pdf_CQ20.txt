Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests (RF). These models can be trained using various types of hardware resources including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. However, without explicit details about the hardware used in this case, it cannot be definitively stated what type of hardware resource was utilized for training these models.
