Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To evaluate how well the models performed, we used three standard
metrics: MSE, mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of deter-
mination (r2). For the grid search, we focused on minimizing the MSE to
identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Prior to conducting the grid
search, we divided our data into a training set (80% of the data) and a
test set (20% of the data). This split ensures that the models are trained
on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen
portion, allowing us to assess their ability to generalize to new, unseen
data accurately.

2.3.3. SHAP values

After training the MLP models, we computed SHAP values using the
model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are
most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the
greening season. We used the implementation in the Python SHAP
package for this analysis Lundberg et al. (2017).

Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a strategy involving several steps. Firstly, they divided their dataset into two parts - a training set consisting of 80% of the data and a test set containing the remaining 20%. This division allowed them to train the models on one portion of the data and then test it on another, previously unseen portion. This approach helped ensure that the models could generalize effectively to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors utilized three standard metrics to evaluate the performance of their models: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R^2). Among these, they primarily focused on minimizing the MSE to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters through a process called Grid Search.

Lastly, after training the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, the authors calculated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method. This step aimed to comprehend which features were most significant in predicting the start and height of the greening season. By employing this comprehensive strategy, the authors ensured effective monitoring of their model's performance throughout the training phase.
