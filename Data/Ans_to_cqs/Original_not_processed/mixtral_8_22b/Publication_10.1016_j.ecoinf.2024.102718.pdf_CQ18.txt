Refers to the size of the trained model, usually measured in terms of parameters or memory
footprint.
Measures the time taken by the model to process a single input and generate an output
prediction.
Represents the number of arithmetic operations performed by the model during inference or
training.
Measures the time taken by the model to process a given dataset or perform a specific task.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To monitor the model performance during training, several strategies have been employed. Firstly, various callbacks such as ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping were used. These callbacks help in dynamically modifying the learning rate based on the validation accuracy and saving the best performing model throughout the training phase. Secondly, the training phase was conducted over 35 epochs with a batch size of 16, and the progress was carefully tracked using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, model size, and analysis time. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model's performance can be thoroughly evaluated and fine-tuned during the training process.
