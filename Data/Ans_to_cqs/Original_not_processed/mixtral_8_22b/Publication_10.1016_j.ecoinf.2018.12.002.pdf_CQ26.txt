Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that various machine learning algorithms like neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines are employed in analyzing and processing data. These methods could potentially help mitigate biases by improving the accuracy of predictions and reducing errors. For instance, ensemble models combining multiple machine learning algorithms might offer better results when dealing with imbalanced datasets or noisy data. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding data preprocessing techniques aimed at addressing bias, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
