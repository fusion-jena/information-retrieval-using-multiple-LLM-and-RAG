5.2. Result analysis 

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models. 

5.2.1. Classic CNN model 

The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model, and 

their classification performance on the test set is shown in Table 6.

5.2.3. Proposed models

shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views. 

4.2. Feature selection

In the work, the CNN pre-training models are constructed with the 
multi-view data of WT spectrum, HHT spectrum and STFT spectrum as 
the input of the network. And the output data is 500 features obtained 
from  the  Dense_1  layer  of  each  CNN.  The  CNN  pre-training  model  is

In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

Helpful Answer:
According to the given context, the dataset was divided into training and testing sets using a ratio of 8:2. This means that 80% of the data was allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 20% was reserved for testing. The number of test samples and training samples were 3094 and 12,340, respectively. The performance of the classification models was evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. However, it should be noted that there is no mention of any validation set in this context. In general, when building machine learning models, including deep learning ones, it is common practice to divide the available data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model.
