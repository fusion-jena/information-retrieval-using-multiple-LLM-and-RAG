For the ML model, training and testing datasets were generated
through reference to existing field datasets and VHR images (Section
2.4.3, Table 2). Areas dominated by the target communities were digi-
tised as polygons and all pixels contained were extracted. These poly-
gons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with ~30% of
pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation. Splitting
polygons rather than pixels minimises the effect of spatial autocorrela-
tion on model accuracies (Karasiak et al., 2022). We used a python
implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) to
classify the VTs, given optimised random trees can be developed
whereby each new tree learns from the errors of those previous. As input
to the ML algorithm, the seasonal vegetation index composites from S2,
backscatter composites from S1, elevation and slope were used, totalling
up to 54 features (Appendix-A). The compositing periods were chosen

grass rush pasture in GMEP. However, if contextual datasets were pro-
vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in
the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

The accuracy assessment at the detailed classification level (Table 5)
showed that classes that were extensive across the country (e.g., culti-
vated/managed vegetation, broadleaved woodland, and needleleaved
plantations) or those dominated by a single or just a few species (e.g.
bracken) were mapped with relatively high accuracies. The classifica-
tion of these classes was strongly driven by EO-datasets and benefited
from systematic integration of each class-specific optimised data-layers.
High model accuracies were obtained for most of the target VTs
(Table 4). This indicated that with nationally consistent training-data,
data-driven algorithms can capture the spectral variations embedded
within the EO-data reasonably well.

based on the seasonal behaviour and respective spectral/backscatter
annual profiles. The model parameters â€“ number of trees, maximum
depth of trees, subsample ratio of columns used for each tree, and model
learning rate - were fine-tuned through a random grid search approach.
Following map production, post-classification refinement was un-
dertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas (e.g.,
swamp in southern Pembrokeshire). This required additional training
data in areas known to be misclassified, with this obtained through
aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits. Following
reclassification of the VTs, the final nine-class VT map was generated.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the machine learning (ML) model discussed in the provided context is for classification. Specifically, it is used to classify Vegetation Types (VTs), which are not explicitly defined but seem to refer to different types of land cover or vegetation found within a specific area. The ML model uses an implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm designed for supervised learning tasks such as regression and classification problems. In this case, the model is being used for multi-class classification to distinguish between various VTs based on input features derived from Earth Observation (EO) datasets, including seasonal vegetation indices, backscatter composites, elevation, and slope. The goal of using this ML model is to create a comprehensive and accurate map of VTs across a specified region, taking advantage of the large amount of available EO data and leveraging advanced computational techniques to extract meaningful information from it.
