Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Training 

We  train  the  proposed  deep  CNN-LSTM 
regressively with the learning time gradually 
decreased. The model was based on the pre-
trained  model  [38]  and  was  trained  to 
classify plant species  and therefore identify 
the new incoming unknown species. The loss 
was taken as the sum of the firing rates of the 
error  neurons  in  the  zeroth  pixel  layer.  A 
random 
search  was 
performed  over 
fourth-  and  fifth-layer 
models  of  the  leaf  features  positions.  Our 
model consists of 20 layers with 3 by 3 filter 
sizes  of  all  convolutions  and  stack  size  per 
layer  of  (1,32,64,64,128,256).  The  initial 

hyperparameter 

training  rate  is  set  to  0.001  dropped  by 
learning ratio of 10 after every 60 epochs.  

Softmax 

The proposed system uses k-way softmax 
classifier to classify image to one among k 
plant species. The loss due to this 
architecture is given by

activation is given in equation 2 

RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6. 
and then compared it with the state-of-the-art 
approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer from general practices in deep learning that techniques like setting a fixed random seed or employing deterministic algorithms could be used to manage randomness. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of the same model. Additionally, performing multiple runs with different seeds and averaging results can also mitigate the effects of randomness. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the approach used in this study, these suggestions remain speculative.
