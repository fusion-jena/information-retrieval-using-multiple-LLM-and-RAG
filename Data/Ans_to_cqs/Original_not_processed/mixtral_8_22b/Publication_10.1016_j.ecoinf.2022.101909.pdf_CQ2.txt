The  implemented  CNN  corresponded  to  a  modified  version  of 
ResNet50, one of the dominant architectures in bioacoustic tasks, and, 
although other authors have applied previous ImageNet training to the 
bioacoustic  domain  (LeBien  et  al.,  2020;  Zhong  et  al.,  2021),  other 
datasets such as Audio Set (Gemmeke et al., 2017) or VGG-Sound (Chen 
et al., 2020) can be just as good as ImageNet for pre-training, either on 
ResNet or on other architectures, such as VGGish, Inception or Mobile-
Net. Another viable option is to pretrain with synthetic clicks or chirps 
(Glotin  et  al.,  2017;  Yang  et  al.,  2021).  Models  already  available  in 
mobile  apps  that  perform  this  same  spectrogram-based  identification 
task are advancing rapidly. To date (October 2022), the BirdNet appli-
cation (Kahl et al., 2021) allows for the identification of more than 3000 
bird species (Wood et al., 2022). In the short term, this particular model

We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the implemented deep learning model uses color spectrograms of two-second durations as inputs. Spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. They are commonly used in the analysis of audio signals, including speech and music. Therefore, the input format used in this deep learning pipeline is essentially derived from audio data. However, since the spectrograms are represented as RGB images, they can also be considered as a form of image data.

Moreover, the context mentions that the ResNet50 model was pre-trained on ImageNet data, which consists of millions of labeled images. This indicates that the model has been trained on image data before being adapted for use with spectrograms. Additionally, the context suggests that other datasets like AudioSet and VGG-Sound can also be used for pre-training, further emphasizing the importance of both audio and image data in this pipeline.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can conclude that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes audio and image data formats. There is no mention of any other data formats like video or CSV files.
