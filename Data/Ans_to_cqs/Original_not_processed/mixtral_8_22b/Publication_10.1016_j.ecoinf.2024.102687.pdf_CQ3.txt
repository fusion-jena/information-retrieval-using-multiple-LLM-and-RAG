qualified field experts that are able to label data manually. The resulting 
annotated databases are however weakly labeled, mainly because the 
labeling  is  often  imprecise  or  lacks  temporal  localization  details  (i.e. 
start  and  end  time  of  sound  events).  To  improve  annotation,  recent 
ecoacoustic studies have introduced interactive visualisation techniques 
(Bravo  Sanchez  et  al.,  2024)  as  well  as  a  data-centric  function  that 
automatically  segments  bird  sounds  in  soundscape  recordings  to 
improve the quality of the recording dataset (Michaud et al., 2023). This 
has  allowed  the  design  of  suitable  pseudo-labeling  functions  to  build 
high-quality training dataset with minimum expert annotation effort.

pretrained DenseNet might fit the Darksound dataset well, but there are 
no  guarantees  that it  will  work  on  another  dataset in  the  exact  same 
manner. All the CNN backbones used in this experiment were previously 
trained on the ImageNet database, a large but very general dataset. It has 
been recently shown that using features extracted from models trained 
on smaller but more specific datasets, that bird sound datasets, leads to 
higher quality classification (Ghani et al., 2023; McGinn et al., 2023). 
Consequently, using features extracted from a model trained on spec-
trograms of bird sounds (e.g.  BirdNET algorithm (Kahl et  al., 2021)), 
could  improve  the  parameter  initialization  of  UML  algorithms  of  the 
MEC method.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that ecoacoustic studies have introduced interactive visualization techniques and a data-centric function that automatically segments bird sounds in soundscape recordings to improve the quality of the recording dataset. These methods could be considered as forms of data annotation, where the goal is to create high-quality training datasets with minimal expert annotation effort. Additionally, the text discusses the use of pre-trained models for feature extraction, which can also be seen as a form of semi-supervised learning or transfer learning, where knowledge gained from one task is applied to another related task. Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does touch upon various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for ecological research.
