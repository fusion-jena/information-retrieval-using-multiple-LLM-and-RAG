2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some relevant techniques mentioned that help improve the model's performance and robustness despite having a relatively small dataset.

Firstly, the authors employed a two-stage training process for their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. During the first stage, they utilized a pretrained convolutional part of the network to extract features from the images. Then, only the top classifier (fully connected layer) was trained based on these extracted features. This method helps leverage existing knowledge from other tasks while adapting the model to the new task.

Secondly, the authors implemented data augmentation by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the original data. It helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization capabilities of the model.

Thirdly, the authors applied dropout techniques to further enhance the model's robustness. Dropout is a regularization technique that involves temporarily removing random neurons along with their connections during training. By doing so, the model becomes more resilient to noise and variations in the input data.

Lastly, the authors chose a suitable network architecture (ResNet-50) that balances representation power and complexity, enabling faster training without compromising accuracy. They also ensured a controlled environment for image acquisition, minimizing potential biases introduced by uncontrolled factors.

In summary, although the given context does not directly discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it highlights several methods used to mitigate data bias and improve model performance. These include a two-stage training process, data augmentation, dropout techniques, selecting an appropriate network architecture, and controlling the image acquisition protocol.
