2.3.2. Model development 

We  modeled  the  relationship  between  SOCS  and  environmental 

covariates using a general predictive function: 

SOCSi = f (R, PM, S, Ci, Bi)

(4)  

where R is the topography, PM is the parent material, S is the soil var-
iable, C is the climate, and B denotes the biota variable. 

We used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer percep-
tron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. This algorithm is a type of feedforward 
artificial  neural  network  (Bishop,  1995)  comprising  an  input  layer, 
multiple hidden  layers, and  an output  layer. The  input layer  receives 
features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the 
hidden layer hides the extracted features, while the output layer yields 
the  prediction  results  (SOCS).  Except  for  the  input  layer,  each  layer 
consists  of  a  set  of  individual  nodes  (neurons).  Each  node  connects 
adjacent layers via the activation function. The MLP technique develops

The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that the researchers used a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. The MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. It uses activation functions to connect adjacent layers and extract features from the input data. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is the multilayer perceptron (MLP).
