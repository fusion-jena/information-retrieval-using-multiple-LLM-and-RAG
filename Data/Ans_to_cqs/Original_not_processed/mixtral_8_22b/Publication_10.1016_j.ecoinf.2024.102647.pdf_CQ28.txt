The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The provided text does not mention any details about the deployment environment or cloud service provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
