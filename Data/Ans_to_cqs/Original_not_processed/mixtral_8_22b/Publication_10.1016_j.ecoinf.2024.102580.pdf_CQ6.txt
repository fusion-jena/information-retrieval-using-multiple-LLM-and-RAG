training, which helped to reduce human error. Similar to the seagrass 
semantic  segmentation  model,  the  resolution  of  the  images  in  the 
ground-truth dataset was reduced to 1000 × 1333, and the three colour 
channels of the images were normalised by subtracting the means and 
dividing  by  the  standard  deviations  per  channel.  The  colour  channel 
means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used 
in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50 (the used mean values 
were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 
0.224, 0.225]). The DETR model’s object queries parameter was set to 
100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image, which 
was sufficient for all case-study images.

By providing the tools to conduct these analyses, we aim to stimulate the uptake of deep learning for enhancing 
the data obtained from aerial imagery to improve the monitoring and conservation of natural ecosystems.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to prepare the input data. In this context, two main preprocessing steps are mentioned for the semantic segmentation model used for vegetation mapping: reducing the resolution of the images and normalizing the color channels.

Firstly, the resolution of the images in the ground-truth dataset is reduced to 1000 x 1333 pixels. This step helps decrease computational requirements during training and can also help prevent overfitting by generalizing the features learned by the model.

Secondly, the three color channels of the images are normalized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. Normalization scales the pixel values to a similar range, making it easier for the model to learn and converge faster. In this case, the color channel means and standard deviations are based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the pre-trained ResNet-50 model. The specific mean values used are [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and the standard deviations are [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

These preprocessing steps ensure that the input data is properly formatted and scaled, enabling the deep learning model to effectively learn from the data and produce accurate results.
