4.3. Data processing

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sample’s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it's common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for such tasks due to their ability to handle parallel computations efficiently. These types of hardware are often preferred over Central Processing Units (CPUs) because they can process large amounts of data simultaneously, making them ideal for machine learning applications like deep learning.
