their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

of these methods degrades when the individual templates fail to capture 
the  within-class  variation  present  in  the  test  set.  As  a  result,  these 
methods  generally struggle to handle large-scale bird populations. To 
address  this,  machine  learning  methods  have  focused  on  complex 
feature  engineering  to  analyze  and  classify  bird  vocalizations  more 
effectively. This includes the use of Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) 
to simulate the distribution of feature spaces, as described by Mohanty 
et al. (2020) and Kalan et al. (2015). Traditional hidden Markov models 
(HMMs) (Janˇcoviˇc et al., 2014; Stastny et al., 2018) utilize probability 
density functions to represent features in each state and identify birds by 
constructing a single model for each species. Discriminant methods such

the  two  datasets  using  the  “stratified  sampling”  method.  We  selected 
birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018, abbreviated as “BC-S" 
(BirdCLEF-Small)  and  “BC-L"  (BirdCLEF-Large).  From  the  Lishui- 
Zhejiang Birdsdata, we chose 100 bird species, referred to as “LS”. We 
then halved the number of training samples of each species for “LS” to 
construct  a  supplementary  small-scale  training  set,  denoted  as  “LS*”. 
The datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 
10% for validation, and 10% for testing to compare the experimental 
results. Detailed statistical information is presented in Table 3.

This section presents the experimental results of our PPNN model,

Random  tanh  distortion.  The  tanh  function  was  used  to  yield  a 
rounded  “soft  clipping”  type  of  distortion  with  a  probability  of  0.25, 
where the distortion amount is proportional to the input gain. 

Adding  background  noise.  Noise  files  from  “NoiseOnly”  were 

randomly selected and added. 

Random clipping and splicing. Spectrograms of the same species 
were randomly cropped and concatenated to expand the sample size, for 
which  the  crop  length  t ∈ U(0, 5).  The  start  of  the  crop  time  and  the

concatenation time were randomly selected as t1, t2 ∈ [0, L (cid:0)
is the length of the spectrogram.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to fix the random seed value before running experiments or training models. By setting a fixed seed, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated will remain consistent across multiple runs, ensuring reproducibility and comparability of results.

In addition to fixing the random seed, data augmentation techniques can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to the original dataset, creating new synthetic examples that can improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the trained models. Some commonly used data augmentation techniques include adding background noise, applying random distortions like tanh function, and performing random clipping and splicing operations on the input data. These techniques can effectively increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, thereby improving the overall performance of the deep learning models.

Moreover, ensemble methods can be utilized to further enhance the stability and reliability of the predictions made by deep learning models. Ensemble methods involve combining the outputs of multiple independently trained models, which can help average out the variability introduced by random initialization and stochastic optimization algorithms. By aggregating the predictions of several models, it becomes possible to achieve better accuracy and robustness compared to relying on a single model alone.

Overall, employing strategies such as fixing the random seed, utilizing data augmentation techniques, and leveraging ensemble methods can significantly contribute to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate results.
