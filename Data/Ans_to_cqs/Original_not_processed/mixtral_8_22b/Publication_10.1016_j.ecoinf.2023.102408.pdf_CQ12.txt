3.5.3. Artificial neural network 

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. 

3.6. Model fitting and evaluation

The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not use a deep learning model but rather employs traditional machine learning models. Specifically, the study utilizes an artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms for modeling complex phenomena and nonlinear regression.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) consist of three different layers: input, hidden, and output. They use calibration parameters like learning rate and weight to improve results. However, they do not fall under the category of deep learning models, as they typically have fewer layers compared to deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers.

Random forests (RFs) are another popular machine learning technique used in this study. RFs are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. Unlike ANNs, RFs do not involve any form of gradient descent optimization or backpropagation, making them fundamentally different from deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, no specific type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or transformer, is mentioned or utilized in the pipeline. Instead, traditional machine learning techniques like ANNs and RFs are employed for modeling purposes.
