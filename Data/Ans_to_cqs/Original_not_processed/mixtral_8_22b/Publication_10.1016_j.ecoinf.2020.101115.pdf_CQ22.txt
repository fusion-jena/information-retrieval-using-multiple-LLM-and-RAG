4.2. Data model & vocabularies

A conceptual diagram of the many types of data that can be gen-

critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

Helpful Answer:

Answer: Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used in evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of actual positives. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. ROC curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, while Confusion Matrix provides a visual summary of prediction results.
