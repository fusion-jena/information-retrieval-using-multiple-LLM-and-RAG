examining  data  characterised  by  functional  attributes  distributed  across  a  spatial  domain.  This  analysis  en-
compasses dimension reduction techniques, as well as supervised and unsupervised methods, which take into 
consideration spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

In  this  study,  we  conducted  an  analysis  of  a  multifrequency  acoustics  dataset  acquired  from  scientific 
echosounders  in  the  West  African  water.  Our  objective  was  to  explore  the  spatial  arrangement  of  marine  or-
ganism aggregations. We investigated various attributes of these intricate biological entities, such as thickness, 
relative density, and depth, in relation to their surroundings. These environmental conditions were represented 
at a fine scale using a towed multiparameter system. This study is closely intertwined with two key domains: 
Fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis. Fisheries acoustics techniques facilitate the collection 
of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales, all 
without causing any disturbance. On the other hand, spatial-functional data analysis is a statistical approach for

stochastic process mainly valued in a Hilbert space. Statistical methods 
for functional data have received a lot of attention from the scientific 
community  (Ramsay  and  Silverman,  2005;  Silverman  and  Ramsay, 
2002) over the last decade. Li et al. (2022) and Koner and Staicu (2023) 
reviewed recently some of the fundamental concepts of the FDA, their 
recent advances, and their impact on practical cases. FDA is an alter-
native to the use of diverse and heterogeneous datasets (Pauthenet et al., 
2017, 2019) of functional, shape or more complex structure. Here we 
studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the 
pelagic environment to take advantage of all the information available 
in the data. Previous work by Diogoul et al. (2020), among others, has 
been  done  on  aggregated  features  from  the  original  data.  Classical

ture dataset from Lake Victoria. Sierra et al. (2017) investigated FDA 
methods to examine particle-size distributions in a beach/shallow ma-
rine  sedimentary  environment in  GijÂ´on  Bay (NW Spain). Acar-Denizli 
et  al.  (2018)  applied  a  functional  linear  regression  model  to  remote 
sensing data, enabling them to predict total suspended solids concen-
tration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary. Tarro-Saavedra 
et al. (2020) classified the seabed in coastal environments by employing 
FDA approaches on acoustic curves. Godard (2021) employed FDA to 
study  high-frequency  physical,  biological,  and  behavioral  data  from 
electronic recorders deployed on marine predators, particularly south-
ern elephant seals. Nonparametric functional spatial regression has been 
explored for mapping the presence of demersal coastal fish from Senegal 
in studies by Ndiaye et al. (2022, 2020). Yarger et al. (2022) utilized a

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain specific details about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the analysis of a multifrequency acoustics dataset from West African waters, focusing on exploring the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations. Various attributes like thickness, relative density, and depth were examined in relation to their surroundings. The study employs both fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is a statistical approach for stochastic processes primarily valued in a Hilbert space. It has gained significant attention from the scientific community due to its ability to handle diverse and heterogeneous datasets. Some examples of FDA applications include examining particle-size distributions in sedimentary environments, predicting total suspended solids concentration in coastal zones, classifying seabeds in coastal environments, and studying high-frequency physical, biological, and behavioral data from electronic recorders deployed on marine predators. In summary, while the context does not directly address data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it provides insights into the application of fisheries acoustics techniques and FDA in analyzing marine ecosystems.
