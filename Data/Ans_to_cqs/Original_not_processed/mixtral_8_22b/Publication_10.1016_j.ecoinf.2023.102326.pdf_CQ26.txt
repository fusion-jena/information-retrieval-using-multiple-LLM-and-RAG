However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

(Wilcox and Keselman, 2003), building 100 bootstrap samples from all 
recordings by hour of day per device and build 95% intervals using the 
2.5% and the 97.5% quantiles of all ASPL values per hour of day; (ii) We 
apply the whole procedure form pre-processing to ASPL calculation on a 
dataset  whose  power  spectra  were  calculated  using  Welch’s  Method 
(with Hamming window function and window length of 2048) (Welch, 
1967) in contrast to our approach to use simple FFT on the whole signal 
and  sorting  the  values  into  1024  equally  sized  bins.  Thereupon,  we 
compare the resulting ASPL diel cycles.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution, oversampling or undersampling to balance classes, and diverse data collection to ensure a wide range of representative samples. These techniques can help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve model performance.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors may have employed some form of data balancing or normalization during preprocessing, but the exact method remains unclear without further details. The study mentions the use of bootstrapping, which involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset through random sampling with replacement. While this technique is often used for estimating statistical parameters, it could also potentially aid in addressing data bias if applied appropriately. Nonetheless, the primary focus of the paper seems to revolve around analyzing large audio datasets rather than discussing specific deep learning pipeline preprocessing techniques.
