S1 Fig. CNNFAST network architecture description. The CNNFAST network consists of two
convolution layers (Conv1 and Conv2), with 16 filters each (shown in yellow, with the filter
size shown inset). Both convolution layers are followed by a max pooling layer (Max Pool1 and
Max Pool2), and the network ends with a fully connected layer with 64 units (Fully Connect).
CNNFAST computes feature maps (shown as white boxes) across the entire input spectrogram,
resulting in less computation and a much faster run time. The fully connected layer is also eval-
uated as a convolution. The output of the detector is a probability vector (shown in green)
whose length is one quarter times the width of the input spectrogram. The numbers below
each layer indicate the height, weight, and depth of the corresponding layer.

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling method to divide the dataset into these subsets. This ensures that the distribution of labels remains consistent across all subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is employed during the development phase to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set serves as an unbiased measure of the final model's performance before deployment. Common ratios for splitting the dataset include 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, but this can vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors.
