Table 3 
The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a MaxEnt model for its analysis. However, there is no explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. Without more specific details about the MaxEnt model implementation, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the provided context.
