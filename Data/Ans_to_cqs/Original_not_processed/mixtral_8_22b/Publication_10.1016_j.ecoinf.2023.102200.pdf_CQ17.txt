Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines. However, common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing co-adaptations between neurons. L1 and L2 regularization add penalty terms to the loss function, encouraging simpler models and preventing overfitting. Early stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, while data augmentation increases the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing images. These techniques can be combined or used individually depending on the requirements of the model and dataset.
