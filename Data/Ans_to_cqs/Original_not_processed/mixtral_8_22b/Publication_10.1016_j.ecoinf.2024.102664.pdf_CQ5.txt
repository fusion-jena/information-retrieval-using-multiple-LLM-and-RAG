In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

2.3. Deep learning model development 

CNN possesses robust capabilities for image feature extraction and is 
recognized as an effective tool for addressing image recognition chal-
lenges (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Lei et al., 2019). It has also found 
applicability in the domain of time series signal processing (Gautam and 
Singh, 2020; Li et al., 2021). The CNN network architecture comprises 
convolutional  and  pooling  layer,  which  are  the  two  principal  hidden 
layers responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN.

Algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022 were evalu-
ated using various deep learning models, as summarized in Table 3. The 
hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  demonstrated 
superior  performance 
throughout  the  year,  achieving  the  highest  values  for  POD  and  HSS 
compared to other models. Notably, the LSTM model outperformed the 
CNN model. The Zhoushan fishery exhibits pronounced seasonal varia-
tion in algal blooms, with the highest occurrence in summer, totaling 
8468 bloom days, followed by Spring with 4720 bloom days. Among all 
seasonal forecasts, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved 
the  highest  HSS  values.  Specifically,  during  the  peak  algal  bloom 
occurrence in summer, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model excelled with both 
POD and HSS at 0.32. In contrast, during winter and autumn, the hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model displayed lower HSS values, primarily due to elevated 
FAR.  Across  all  model  forecasts  and  seasonal  variations,  the  POCR

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which datasets were utilized in the study.

Based on the available information, we can only infer that the study involves developing deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for algal bloom forecasts in the Zhoushan fishery. However, details regarding the datasets used for training these models are not mentioned.
