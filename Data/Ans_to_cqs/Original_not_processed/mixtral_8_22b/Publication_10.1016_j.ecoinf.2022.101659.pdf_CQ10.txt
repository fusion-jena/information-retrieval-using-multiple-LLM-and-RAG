Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

also other bivalve species and other locations. This may go so far as even 
including  bivalves  in  offshore  environments.  Overall,  this  would 
improve bioenergetic models, where clearance and respiration terms are 
inherently  linked  with  gaping.  The  current  formulations  of  models 
however do not account for linkages with food, aside from considering a 
half saturation constant, nor the different degrees of daily oscillations. 
Further  experimentation,  under  constrained  lab  conditions,  linking 
gaping activity with actual clearance rate and respiration rates under 
different  settings  will  also  help  devising  indices  that  could  be  then 
extrapolated to use gaping directly in the models. An indication of en-
ergy consumption during valve movement would also be useful to infer 
the  consequences of  having  a more or less  pronounced  amplitudes of 
gaping, to better formulate this term in energetic based growth models.

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

We  are  thankful  to  Cristina  Breggion  and  Andrea  Sambo  for  their 
technical  and  fieldwork  help,  Luciano  Boffo  for  help  accessing  the 
mussel culture sites, Ilaria Bernardini, Giulia Dalla Rovere and Morgan 
Smith for field assistance.
