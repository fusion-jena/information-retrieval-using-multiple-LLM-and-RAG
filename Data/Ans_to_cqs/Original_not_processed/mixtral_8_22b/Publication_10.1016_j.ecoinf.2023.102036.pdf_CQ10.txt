4. Discussion 

Deep learning is a rising tool for ecologists, covering a wide range of 
topics (Christin et al., 2019), such as the identification of animal species 
(Norouzzadeh et al., 2021) or the estimation of biodiversity in large data 
sets  (James  and  Bradshaw,  2020).  Among  the  current  applications  of 
deep learning techniques in ecology, identification and classification of 
individuals based on photographs have been proposed as a useful tool

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by the authors. The text does not mention any specific links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or other version control systems where their deep learning pipeline might be stored. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
