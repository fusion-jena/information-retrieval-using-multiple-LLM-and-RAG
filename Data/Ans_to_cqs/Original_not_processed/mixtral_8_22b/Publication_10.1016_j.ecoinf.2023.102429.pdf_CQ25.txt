SVMR is a kernel-based machine learning algorithm that originated 
in  statistical  theory  and  can  be  used  for  regression  and  classification 
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The algorithm maps each covariate in the 
training set (sensitive bands filtered by the CARS algorithm) to a high- 
dimensional feature space by using a kernel function. Epsilon refers to 
an insensitive loss function that maps the maximum epsilon deviation of 
the independent data and the associated training data. Errors within the 
epsilon are ignored, whereas errors larger than the epsilon are penal-
ized. The epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) 
are  used  to  construct  the  calibration  model.  Epsilon-SVR  optimal  pa-
rameters (e.g., cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g) are used to make the 
model  achieve  the  best  accuracy,  where  parameters  C  and  p  help  us 
avoid overfitting of SVMR. For each parameter combination, the best

parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values (De San-
tana  et  al.,  2021).  SVM  was  performed  in  MATLAB  R2016a,  and  the 
training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of any specific deep learning model. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and others. These models could be used for various purposes including classification, regression, or even object detection depending on their implementation and application. In this particular case, the SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is used to construct a calibration model for soil spectral reflectance data. This suggests that the primary goal might be to predict certain properties of the soil based on its spectral characteristics. Nevertheless, without further context, we cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the query.
