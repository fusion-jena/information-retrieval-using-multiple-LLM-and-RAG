2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

In remote sensing and environmental analysis, advanced modelling 
techniques  like  ANN  have  demonstrated  remarkable  proficiency  in 
deciphering complex patterns within diverse datasets, especially satel-
lite data. Notably, Stepchenko (2016) underscored the pivotal role of 
comprehending data characteristics and implementing effective prepa-
ration techniques, such as feature selection through stepwise regression 
and  principal  component  analysis,  in  refining  prediction  accuracy. 
These foundational steps lay the groundwork for deploying predictive 
models like Linear Regression Models (LRM) to forecast critical indices 
such as the NDVI Time Series. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowl-
edge that ANNs might face certain limitations when used independently. 
To  address  these  limitations  and  enhance  their  performance,  hybrid 
methodologies have emerged, integrating ANNs with other techniques

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on specific criteria, ensuring each subset has a representative sample of the entire population. This technique helps maintain the original class distribution in both the training and testing sets.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic samples are created from existing minority classes to balance the dataset. It can be achieved using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the majority class size to match the minority class count. Random under-sampling and NearMiss are popular undersampling methods.

Collecting diverse data involves gathering more data points representing different aspects of the problem domain. This approach aims to reduce bias caused by limited representation in the dataset.

While the given context doesn't explicitly mention these techniques, they are generally applicable to handling data bias in deep learning pipelines.
