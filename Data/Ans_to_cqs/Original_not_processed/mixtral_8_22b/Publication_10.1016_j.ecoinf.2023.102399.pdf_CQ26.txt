There is no doubt that low-quality images will increase the workload 
of  image  processing,  requiring  more  complex  algorithms.  Obtaining 
high-quality  images  through  a  fully  automated  biomass  estimation 
method, without any manual intervention, can significantly reduce the 
workload  for  humans.  To  decrease  the  need  for  manual  intervention, 
Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015) implemented a deep learning technique that 
automatically detected and identified the head and mouth of Southern 
Bluefin tuna that were cultured in deep-sea cages. The head and mouth 
of the fish in specific positions within the underwater stereo images were 
accurately recognized using the Haar classifier. Although this technique 
efficiently  decreases  manual  processes,  achieving  fully  automated 
acquisition  of  biomass  information  is  still  lacking  in  certain  aspects.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing samples or selecting only those that contribute most to the model's performance.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and variations. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.
