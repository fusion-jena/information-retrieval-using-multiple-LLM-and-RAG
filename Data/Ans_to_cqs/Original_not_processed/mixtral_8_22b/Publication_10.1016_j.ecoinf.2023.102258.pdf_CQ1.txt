Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.
