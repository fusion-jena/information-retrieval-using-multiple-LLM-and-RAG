This is a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams
and uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a basic building block in which the
outputs of each level are used as inputs to the next one (Sun, Zhang, Zhang, & Hu, 2017).
An autoencoder is an ANN used for unsupervised learning of eﬃcient coding. The aim
of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, but with the
output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the
purpose of reconstructing its own inputs (instead of predicting target value Y given
inputs X). The algorithm is described below (Sun et al., 2017):

Through a series of new learning architectures and algorithms, have been transformed;
DELE methods are now the state-of-the-art in object, speech and audio recognition.
Deng and Yu (2013) had proposed methods and applications of DELE. A large deep
convolutional neural network trained (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012) to classify
1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into 1000
diﬀerent classes.
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
become very popular and have achieved great success in many computer vision
tasks particularly in object recognition. Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks
(CSRNs) applied (Alom, Alam, Taha, & Iftekharuddin, 2017) to generate initial ﬁlters
of CNNs for features extraction and Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM)
for classiﬁcation. Experiments were conducted on three popular data sets for object
recognition (such as face, pedestrian, and car) to evaluate the performance of the pro-

The implementation of this proposed framework was based on the DELE philosophy.
An important aspect of the framework is the usage of ELM which has proven to be
capable, of solving a multidimensional and complex IT problem. The Deep ELM simulates
the functioning of biological brain cells in a most realistic mode. This creates the potential
for a fully automated conﬁguration of the model with high accuracy classiﬁcation. An inno-
vative aspect of this work is the development of this model using Online Sequential Multi-
layer algorithm plus a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder that
aims to optimize the choice of the input layer weights and bias. This has been done in
order to achieve a higher level of generalization. This method combines two highly
eﬀective machine learning algorithms, for solving a multidimensional and complex
machine hearing problem. Another interesting point is the performance of feature extrac-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline utilizes a multi-layered neural network model that employs the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a fundamental component. Each level's outputs serve as inputs for the subsequent level. Additionally, an autoencoder is incorporated, which is a form of artificial neural network utilized for unsupervised learning of efficient coding. Its purpose is to learn a representation for a dataset while maintaining the output layer's node count equal to the input layer's, with the goal of reconstructing its own inputs rather than forecasting target values. Furthermore, the text mentions Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have gained popularity recently and demonstrated significant success in numerous computer vision tasks, especially in object recognition. However, it does not explicitly specify whether the mentioned multi-layered neural network or the autoencoder is a CNN. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine if the pipeline exclusively uses CNNs or incorporates other types of deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers.
