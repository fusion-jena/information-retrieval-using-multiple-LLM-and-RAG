augmentation  techniques  were  used  to  artificially  create  a  larger 
training  set  by  randomly  flipping  each  input  image  horizontally  and 
vertically with a probability of 0.5 each and rotating the images by up to 
180
.  Weighted  cross-entropy  was  used  as  the  loss  function  and  the 
stochastic  gradient  descent  optimization  algorithm  was  used  to  mini-
mize the loss function. The model accuracy was assessed after each full 
training set iteration (epoch), quantifying the proportion of correct class 
predictions out of the total predictions made. Precision was determined 
as  the  ratio  of  correct  predictions  to  the  total  number  of  predictions, 
encompassing both false and accurate ones. Recall, on the other hand, 
measured the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of pixels 
that should be assigned to that specific class.

et al., 2023; Hodgson et al., 2018; Ventura et al., 2018). These two deep 
learning approaches require initial ground-truth datasets consisting of 
annotated images, which are used to train a model that iteratively im-
proves  by  evaluating  its  output  against the  provided  annotations  and 
adjusting its parameters to match the desired output. Once trained, the 
models can be applied to new datasets for automatic classification, of-
fering  flexibility  and  power  by  learning  directly  from  image  output. 
Recent advancements in open-source user frameworks have made deep 
learning more accessible (Christin et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2019; Perry 
et al., 2022). With this study, we aim to further stimulate the uptake of 
deep  learning  techniques  in  ecology  and  conservation  by  providing 
open-access scripts that can be adapted to various ecosystems, including 
challenging coastal environments.
