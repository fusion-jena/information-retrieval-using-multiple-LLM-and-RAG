Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that Earth Observation data was likely collected using remote sensing technology such as satellites like Sentinel-2, which is mentioned in the keywords section. Additionally, the citation of Steinbach et al.'s work on wetland delineation and characterization layers suggests that this data may have been used in the analysis. The article also mentions a framework of filtering rules over ground truth samples, indicating that some form of sampling or surveying may have been conducted. Overall, while the exact methods used for data collection are not specified, it appears that a combination of satellite imagery and potentially field sampling were employed.
