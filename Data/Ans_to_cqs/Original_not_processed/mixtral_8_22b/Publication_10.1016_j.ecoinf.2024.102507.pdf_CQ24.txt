After  completing  the  image  format  conversion,  we  used  ArcPy  to 
divide each forest type, starting from the upper left corner, into 256 ×
256-pixel  image  units  to  create  deep  learning  samples.  As  shown  in 
Fig. 4, the forest types in categories 4–9 are not large. However, deep 
learning requires a large number of samples. Therefore, in order to in-
crease  the  number  of  samples  of  the  small  forest  types,  we  moved  a 
distance of 128 pixels in the x and y directions when creating the next 
image unit, giving each image a 50% overlap rate. Simultaneously, at 
◦
each unit position, we rotated every 45
to generate a new image unit 
and used multiple angles to obtain the same set of training samples to 
enhance the data.

3.1. Sample extraction for deep learning 

This study aimed to use deep learning algorithms to classify hyper-
spectral images of forest types. In order to increase the correctness and 
consistency  of  features  extracted  from  deep  learning  samples  and  to 
consider  the  practical  feasibility  and  reliability  of  ground  truth  data 
produced after aerial photography, image mapping, and field survey, we 
interpreted the  definition based on aerial photographs. The nine sub-
sequently identifiable forest types are listed below, and the spatial dis-
tribution of samples in each forest type is shown in Fig. 4:  

• Cryptomeria-like Taiwania afforestation (Cryptomeria-like Taiwania 
is the dominant tree species, which may be mixed with other invasive 
species) – TYPE1  

• Cryptomeria-like Taiwania + Alder afforestation (Cryptomeria-like 

Taiwania + Alder are the dominant tree species) – TYPE2

VGG19 network architecture and adds a residual unit involving a short- 
circuit  mechanism,  which  can  overcome  the  issue  of  gradient  disap-
pearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss some techniques used to enhance the dataset for deep learning purposes. To address the lack of sufficient samples for smaller forest types, they created overlapping image units by moving a distance of 128 pixels in both x and y directions while generating the next image unit. This resulted in a 50% overlap rate between consecutive images. Additionally, they generated new image units by rotating each unit every 45 degrees, thereby obtaining the same set of training samples from various angles to enrich the data. These methods help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, but do not directly tackle the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
