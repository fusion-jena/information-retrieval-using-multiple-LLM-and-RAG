3.3. SRS data

In the pursuit of enhancing our comprehension of aquatic systems, 
the SMARTLAGOON project has been a pivotal initiative. Through this 
project,  an  innovative  satellite  data  collection  tool  was  developed, 
which systematically collects water quality data from public Application 
Programming  Interfaces  (APIs)  of  major  space  agencies  including  the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration  (NASA).  This  tool  is  engineered  to  meet  the  needs  of 
users and third-party applications, providing historical and current data 
insights,  thus  constructing  an  organized  and  coherent  time  series  of 
varied  variables  obtained  by  Satellite  Remote  Sensing  (SRS)  services. 
The  architecture  of  this  sophisticated  tool  is  divided  into  two  core 
components as shown in Fig. 2. The first component focuses on acquiring 
satellite  imagery  for  predefined  geospatial  coordinates  over  a  deter-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions a crawling tool developed to gather historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, but it does not specify where this data is stored or made accessible. It also discusses the use of NetCDF files sourced from either ESA or NASA, which include important parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. However, no specific repositories are mentioned. Additionally, the text refers to a README.md file that might provide more operational details about the tools used, but again, it doesn't indicate where the actual data repository can be found. Therefore, without further context or information, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
