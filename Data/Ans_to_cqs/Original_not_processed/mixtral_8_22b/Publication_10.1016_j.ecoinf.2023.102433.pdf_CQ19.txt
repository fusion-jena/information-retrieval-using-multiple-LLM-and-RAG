2.  According to the cloud architecture, GEE is a SaaS (Software-as-a- 
service). This translates into services (e.g., available datasets, allo-
cated resources, implemented algorithms, export data formats, and 
so on) entirely managed by Google and not (or hardly) modifiable by 
the single user. For instance, in GEE deep learning analysis can be 
performed  using  Tensorflow,  a  machine  learning  and  artificial  in-
telligence  open-source  framework  developed  by  the  Google  Brain 
team (Abadi et al., 2016). Although Tensorflow is one of the leading 
machine  learning  frameworks,  this  excludes  the  possibility  of 
employing different open-source machine learning systems such as 
PyTorch primarily developed by Facebook AI Research lab (FAIR) 
(Ketkar and Jojo, 2021), Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (Seide 
and Amit, 2016), Caffe of the University of California, Berkeley, US 
(Jia et al., 2014) or novel algorithms for deep learning (Zhu et al.,

The Python nasawebservice is a user-friendly package that provides a 
set of classes and methods to define pipelines for the automatic MODIS 
data ingestion from the NASA MODIS/VIIRS Land Products Web Service. 
The nasawebservice is implemented in the Python 3 programming lan-
guage. Its dependencies are requests, aiohttp, and asyncio (Hunt, 2019). 
The  remaining  dependencies  used  are  standard  libraries  for  maximal 
compatibility. To facilitate the users in the creation of their data process 
workflows, the nasawebservice was designed to be as close as possible to 
the  Global  Subset  APIs  of  the  NASA  service  making  use  of  wrapper 
methods,.  Furthermore,  the  library  provides  additional  methods  with 
the purpose of making the data ingestion pipeline scalable according to 
various  user  needs.  All  these  methods  are  exposed  by  NasaWebServi-
ceAPIProvider  class. NasaWebServiceAPIProvider object is  initialized by

Helpful Answer:
According to the given information, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) uses Tensorflow as its primary framework for performing deep learning analyses. Tensorflow is an open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. However, it should be noted that since GEE is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the choice of framework is entirely managed by Google and cannot be modified by individual users. Therefore, other popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), or Caffe are not supported within the GEE platform.
