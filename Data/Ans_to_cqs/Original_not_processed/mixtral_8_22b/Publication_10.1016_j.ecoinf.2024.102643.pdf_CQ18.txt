Modeling  was  performed  by  generating  1000  random  pseudo- 
absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and 
testing (20%) datasets (Huang et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2021; Salinas- 
Ramos et al., 2021). To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points were 
generated  three  times  for  each  model  and  cross-validated  per  model 
using bootstrapping (Carvalho et al., 2021). We evaluated and compared 
the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the 
receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic) (Araújo and New, 
2007).  True  skill  statistics  value  changes  between  (cid:0) 1  and  + 1,  with 
positive values indicating a perfect fit, while AUC values range from 0.5 
to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive 
power (Fielding and Bell, 1997).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves generating 1000 random pseudo-absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points are generated three times for each model and cross-validated per model using bootstrapping. The performance and accuracy of each model are then evaluated and compared using AUC (area under the receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic). Positive true skill statistics values indicate a perfect fit, while higher AUC values indicate improved accuracy and predictive power.
