2.1.3. Data partition 

The raw dataset was randomly shuffled, after which the shuffled data 
were divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training set was 
used to learn the parameters of the model during the training process, 
and the validation set was used to evaluate the modeling and tune its 
hyperparameters. Finally, the performance and generalizability of the 
optimal model were evaluated using the test set. The data partitioning 
ratio between the training, validation, and test sets was set as 8:1:1 and 
the random partition was repeated ten times to reduce the influence of 
random splitting while ensuring converged performance (Geras et al., 
2017).

2.3. Model optimization 

The model performance optimization process is broadly divided into 
two stages, as shown in Fig. 3. The R value of the validation set is used as 
the performance indicator during the optimization process, whereby R is 
maximized  using  the  grid  search  method.  During  the  first  stage,  the 
neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers 
are  adjusted.  In  total,  60  sets  of  combinations,  including  one  to  five 
hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64–2048 (nth  power of 2), 
were considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of 
the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a 
total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

the percentage value of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the 
batch size, the optimal model was obtained with an R value of 0.76.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. This validation set is used to evaluate the modeling and tune its hyperparameters. The performance of the model on this validation set is monitored by maximizing the R-value using the grid search method. During the first stage of optimization, the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers are adjusted. A total of 60 sets of combinations are considered for this purpose. In the second stage, the percentage of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size are adjusted to obtain the optimal model.
