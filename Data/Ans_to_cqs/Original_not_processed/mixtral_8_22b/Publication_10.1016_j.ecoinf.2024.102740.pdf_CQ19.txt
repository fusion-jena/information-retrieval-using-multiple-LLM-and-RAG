1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Highlights 
  Semi-natural grasslands are vital for production, ecology and biodiversity 
  Ground surveys classify grassland species into two main clusters 
  Machine Learning methods to assess Aboveground Biomass and ecological classification 
  Machine learning methods enable sustainable grassland management

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details on the frameworks used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized based solely on this information. To find out which framework was used, one would need access to the original research articles or contact the authors directly.
