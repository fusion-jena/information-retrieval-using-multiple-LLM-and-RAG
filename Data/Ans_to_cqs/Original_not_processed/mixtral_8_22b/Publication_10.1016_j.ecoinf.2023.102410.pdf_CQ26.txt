Helpful Answer:
The table and text provided do not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about this topic, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of classes or categories within each set. This helps ensure that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of samples in each class to balance the dataset. Oversampling increases the number of minority class examples by duplicating them, while undersampling reduces the majority class examples by randomly removing some instances. These methods can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and variations. This approach can improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model by exposing it to various types of input data.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often involves using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method has its advantages and limitations, so selecting the appropriate technique depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the dataset and problem at hand.
