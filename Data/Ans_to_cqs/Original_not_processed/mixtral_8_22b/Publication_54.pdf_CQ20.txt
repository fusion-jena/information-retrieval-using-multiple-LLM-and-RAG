Y.-P. Huang, H. Basanta: Recognition of Endemic Bird Species Using Deep Learning Models

The structure of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes data acquisition and preprocessing of
acquired dataset to overcome imbalanced and data overﬁt-
ting. Section III focuses on the deep learning models and
enhancement of ﬁne grained feature extraction accuracy by
swapping the misclassiﬁed data between the training and
validation datasets. Section IV illustrates the experimental
setting and the hardware requirements. Section V endorses
the proof of concept and validation of the purposed method-
ology. Section VI emphasizes the signiﬁcances of endemic
birds and its habitation. Finally, Section VII summarizes the
impact of the purposed model and presents directions for
future study.

The following procedures are used in the approach devel-

oped in this study.

the holdout validation dataset. The presented work was imple-
mented using the TensorFlow libraries on a GPU workstation
with an Intel Xeon 8 CPU, 32 GB of memory, and an Nvidia
GeForce 11 GB GRX 2080 Ti graphics card.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
In this experiment, 760 images, which were excluded from
the training and validation datasets, were used for testing.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model was implemented using the TensorFlow libraries on a GPU workstation with an Intel Xeon 8 CPU, 32 GB of memory, and an Nvidia GeForce 11 GB GRX 2080 Ti graphics card. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include a GPU (Nvidia GeForce 11 GB GRX 2080 Ti), an Intel Xeon 8 CPU, and 32 GB of memory.
