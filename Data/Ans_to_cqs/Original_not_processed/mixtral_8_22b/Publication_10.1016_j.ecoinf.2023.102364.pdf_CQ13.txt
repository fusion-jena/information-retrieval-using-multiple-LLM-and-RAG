2.3. Machine learning ensembles 

We  used  the  combined  2014–2015  Short-billed  Gull  presence/ 
absence data cube to train an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models 
in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3 (Formula 1). We used several 
established and leading ML algorithms (Hegel et al., 2010; Fern´andez- 
Delgado et al., 2014 for overview) and combined them in an averaged 
ensemble to obtain the best-possible prediction and overall synergy from 
each algorithm best as possible (sensu J. Friedman ‘many weak learners 
make for a strong learner’; Friedman, 2002, Hastie et al., 2009. See also 
Hardy et al., 2011, Fox et al., 2017 and Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2022 
for applications). That approach will overcome stand-alone approaches 
such  as  linear  regression,  which  do  not  offer  unique  solutions,  e.g. 
Ascombe’s Quartet, and have difficulty to meet all required parametric 
assumptions (McArdle, 1988). The specific algorithms and their settings 
are described below.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the application of machine learning ensembles using various established and leading ML algorithms like Random Forest, TreeNet, CART, and MARS. These methods were employed to create an averaged ensemble for predicting Short-billed Gull presence/absence based on a 2014-2015 dataset. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
