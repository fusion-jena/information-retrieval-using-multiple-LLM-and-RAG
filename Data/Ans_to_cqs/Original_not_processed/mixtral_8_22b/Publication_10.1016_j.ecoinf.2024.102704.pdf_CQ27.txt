several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
â€˜convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

parameters of all the model layers, is linked to the required disk space

The  experiments  were  conducted  on  a  Windows  10-based  mobile 
laptop  equipped  with  an  Intel(R)  i7-11800H  CPU  and  a  GeForce 
RTX3080  GPU  with  16GB  of  video  memory.  The  PyCharm  software 
platform was utilised to carry out the experiments, employing Python 
3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. 
The  details  of  the  specific  environmental  configurations  and  model 
training parameters are listed in Table 1. To enhance detection accuracy, 
this study established detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, 
indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 
30% or higher was considered valid and thus retained.

Helpful Answer:

After training the deep learning model using the PyTorch 1.9 deep learning framework on a laptop with an Intel(R) i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU, the next step would be to deploy the trained model. However, the given context does not provide explicit information about the deployment process.

Typically, after training a deep learning model, it needs to be serialized or saved so that it can be used later for prediction or inference tasks. This involves saving the model architecture and its learned weights and biases to a file. Once the model has been serialized, it can be loaded back into memory when needed.

In terms of platform selection, the choice depends on various factors such as hardware requirements, scalability, latency, cost, and ease of use. For instance, if the application requires real-time predictions, a cloud-based solution like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform might be suitable. On the other hand, if the application runs on edge devices with limited computing power, a lightweight framework like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime could be used.

However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific steps were taken to deploy the trained deep learning model in this case.
