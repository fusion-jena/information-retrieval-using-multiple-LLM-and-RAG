2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in this case study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of any such model. However, the context does describe a knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process, which involves identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset to make important decisions. This process includes steps such as identifying the aim for a specific study area, pre-selecting useful data to achieve the objective, performing analytical determinations, and optimizing and elaborating the obtained results. It is also mentioned that the numerical values of some parameters were calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain the data mining results. These steps suggest that the overall goal of this process may be to extract insights from the data to inform decision making, rather than to use a deep learning model for a specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
