learning  models  namely  GoogleNet,  ResNet,  and  ResNeXT 
with different configurations [25]. In another study, Ghazi et 
al.  [26]  ensembled  the  results  of  GoogleNet  and  VGG 
networks  to  obtain  an  accuracy  of  80.18%  on  a  validation 
dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. A bagging ensemble of 
three ResNet152-layered CNN networks was used by Šulc and 
Matas  to  obtain  a  performance  of  78.8%  mean  average 
precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset [27].

of 87.8% and 91.2% respectively. A comparative evaluation 
of deep learning models was performed by [20] to identify 109 
plant  species  from  the  28,046  images  collected  online.  The 
results  showed  that  MobileNetV2  emerged  as  the  best 
performing  model  with  an  accuracy  of  83.9%  compared  to 
other models. Unlike the approach of [17],[18],[19], and [20], 
Krause  et  al.  [21]  proposed  a  two-stage  approach  for 
identifying  plant  species  from  the  natural  environment.  In 
their  proposed  method,  the  authors  used  a  deep  learning 
semantic segmentation model to segment the plant from the 
images and then used a multiscale crop of the segmented plant 
to train an Inception-ResNet-V2 model. Using the dataset of 
100  species  with  4,500  training  images,  the  proposed 
approach improved the performance of the model by 5.4% to 
achieve  an  accuracy  of  89.21%.  To  study  the  taxonomic

Similar to [22], Wu et al. [23] proposed a taxonomic loss 
that takes into account the higher taxonomic classification of 
the  species  to  update  CNN  weights  during  training.  Using 
SENet-154  trained  on  PlantCLEF  2017  dataset,  the  model 
achieved  an  improved  accuracy  of  84.07%,  79.97%,  and 
73.61% at family, genus, and species levels compared to the 
traditional cross-entropy loss. The diversity of deep learning 
models  is  becoming  essential  in  improving  the  overall 
performance  in  plant  identification  task  [16].  This  enables 
different CNN models with different network configurations 
to learn diverse features to improve the overall performance 
[24].  For  example,  Haupt  et  al.  [24]  ensembled  the 
performance of ResNet50 and two DenseNet201 to obtain a 
top-1 accuracy of 77% on the PlantCLEF 2017 dataset. On the 
other hand, Lasseck  obtained a  top-1  accuracy of 88.5% on 
PlantCLEF 2017 dataset by ensemble results of twelve deep
