3.7. Performance metrics 

In this work, we measure the accuracy of the deep-learning models 

by using the following metrics:  

• Accuracy 

accuracy which is a simple metric for deep-learning classification 
models. This metric measures the overall percentage of correct pre-
dictions. However, accuracy does not take into account the different 
types  of  errors.  That  is  the  reason  we  employ  other  metrics  for 
measuring the efficiency of deep learning models. 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

• Precision 

(1)    

Precision  is  a  metric  that  measures  the  number  of  positive  pre-
dictions  that  are  actually  correct  viz.  a  viz.  correct  and  incorrect 
positive predictions. 

recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions 
that are actually correct viz. a viz. correct positive predictions and 
incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive 
predictions were correctly spotted by the model. 

Recall = TP

TP + FN

ensembles chosen from combinations of the previous five models and 
their corresponding accuracy and F1-score. It can be seen from the table 
that InceptionResNetv2 model has the highest accuracy among the other 
deep  learning  models.  Also,  it  can  be  seen  that  ResNet50v2  has  the 
lowest  accuracy  of  all  the  deep  learning  models.  This  is  possibly  the 
reason that the proposed ensemble model with higher accuracy doesn’t 
include  ResNet50v2  model.  It  is  also  clear  that  DenseNET,  Effi-
ciecntNetB0,  EfficientNetB3  and  InceptionResNetv2  have  comparable 
accuracies.  On  the  other  hand,  ResNet50v2  has  a  small  accuracy 
compared to them. The table also shows the F1-score. It can be seen from 
the table that there are around six models that have an F1-score of 0.999. 
One  of  these  models  is  the  ensemble  that  has  the  best  accuracy.  The 
results in Figs. 7 and 6 show the accuracy and loss along with the epochs

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy is a simple metric that measures the overall percentage of correct predictions but does not consider the types of errors. Precision is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. Recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct versus correct positive predictions and incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive predictions were correctly spotted by the model. Additionally, the F1-score is another metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.
