deeper, its optimization capability can be further improved. How- 
ever, deep CNN networks require very large amounts of training 
data. Table 6 shows examples of existing well-known datasets and 
their size as quantity of images. The biggest plant database that 
we  have  found  is  the  PlantClef2015  dataset  [6]  which  has  only 
around 113,205 number of images. This is still far from matching 
the scale and variety of existing general major datasets for images 
[51,52,55] , videos [53] or languages [54] . In addition, we can see 
that the PlantClef2015 dataset [6] has one of the largest number 
of object categories but the least number of images. For example, 
compared to the ILSVRC 2010 dataset [55] , it has less than 10% of 
their total images but the same number of categories. Hence, to

In Section 4 , using the V1 strategy on Malayakew dataset, we 
analysed the global response of ﬁlters in each convolution layer. 
In this section, in order to gain insights into CNN, we further ex- 
plore the local responses of individual ﬁlters in each convolution 
layer. We randomly subsample some of the feature maps/channels 
in each layer and reconstruct them back to image pixels to reveal 
the structures within each patch that stimulated a particular fea- 
ture map using the DN approach [36] . We also run through all the 
training samples, and subsequently discover which portions of the 
training images caused the ﬁring of neurons. By doing this, we can 
improve our understanding of the transformation of the features 
learned in each layer and realise the characteristic of each layer in 
the CNN. Fig. 4 shows the feature visualisation of layer 1. We can 
see that some of the ﬁlters learned are similar to a set of Gabor-

Helpful Answer:
The paper mentions several datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. These include MS COCO [51], Places2 [52], Sport-1M [53], Visual Genome QA [54], ILSVRC 2010 [55], and PlantClef2015 dataset [6]. However, the specific details about these datasets such as the type of data they contain, their size, and other relevant information are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined what kind of datasets these are (e.g., whether they are image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet).
