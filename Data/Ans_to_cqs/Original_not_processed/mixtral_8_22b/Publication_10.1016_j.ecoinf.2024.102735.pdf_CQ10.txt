Data-driven models have evolved as effective decision-support tools
for HABs monitoring and prediction. These models are essential for
using patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem vari-
ables to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-
cyanin, algal cells, and toxins (Busari et al., 2023; Kimambo et al.,
2019). Machine learning (ML) models such as random forest (RF),
Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and
support vector regression (SVR) have been used successfully to predict
different algal-related parameters and help identify drivers of HABs (Liu
et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015, Busari et al., 2023).
Model predictions are, however, influenced by varying degrees of un-
certainty (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). According to Guzman et al. (2015),
uncertainty refers to the variation between the actual state of a variable
and its theoretical assessment at a particular time. These prediction

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It would require more specific details about the source or author of the deep learning model being referred to. However, it can be assumed that since the paper mentioned uses deep learning techniques, the corresponding code might be found in popular repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the relevant code, one could search these platforms using keywords related to the topic, such as 'deep learning', 'chlorophyll-a', 'harmful algal blooms', etc. Additionally, checking the references section of the paper may lead to other papers or resources containing links to the required code.
