of the FFT window, 1024. The feature extraction parameters that yielded 
the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase 
in optimizing the CNN deep learning model. The results of model opti-
mization  were  acquired  by  employing  identical  performance  metrics 
used in optimizing the feature extraction parameters (Fig. 13).

In a CNN, a convolution layer performs convolution operations be-
tween the pixels on the input and several kernels or filters. The math-
ematical equation of the convolution process is as follows, where f is the 
input data and h is the kernel size. 

G[m, n] = (f *h)[m, n] =

h[j, k]f [m (cid:0)

The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained
