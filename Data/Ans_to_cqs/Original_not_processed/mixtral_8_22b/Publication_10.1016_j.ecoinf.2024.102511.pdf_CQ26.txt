Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general approaches that can be applied to tackle this issue. For instance, the text suggests that neural networks usually need substantial sample sizes for all classes, which implies that having balanced datasets could help mitigate potential biases. Additionally, the reference to Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) indicates that data augmentation methods might also play a role in addressing data imbalance or bias. Furthermore, the mention of combining disparate datasets hints at the possibility of employing diverse data collection strategies to improve dataset representativeness. Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to handle class imbalances and data bias in deep learning pipelines.
