these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

To re-identify candidate regions, we then applied EfficientNet for the 
outputs from the YOLOv4. Table 4 shows the results in which outputs 
from  the  YOLOv4  with  random  erasing  were  re-identified  using  the 
EfficientNet. In these results, all classifier models were trained on the 
dataset  with  random  elimination  applied.  The  results  suggest  that 
EfficientNet-B1  was  the  most  accurate  among  the  five  classifiers 
(Table 4). The trained EfficientNet-B1 model was well fitted to valida-
tion datasets (Fig. S2), indicating that the model training operated well. 
To  test  the  effects  of  random  erasing  on  the  performance  of  the 
EfficientNet,  we  applied  the  two-stage  method  for  the  annotated  test 
video. Table 5 displays the confusion matrices of the two-stage detection 
using the YOLOv4 with random erasing and the EfficientNet-B1 with or 
without random erasing. Table 6 shows the detection performance of

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions a technique called "random erasing" applied during the training phase of the EfficientNet model. Random erasing is a data augmentation strategy where parts of input images are randomly eliminated, helping improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model. This approach introduces controlled randomness into the training process, potentially mitigating the impact of other sources of randomness like initial weights or order of examples. Nevertheless, specific strategies for managing random seed values or addressing other aspects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not discussed in the given context.
