To  determine  risk  probabilities  across  Türkiye  and  to  reduce  the 
uncertainty among models, we constructed a final ensemble conflict risk 
model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented 
in the biomod2 package (Thuiller, 2014). By combining predictions from 
several  different  modeling  approaches,  ensemble  models  have  been 
shown  to  produce  more  robust  results  when  compared  to  individual 
models  (Buonincontri  et  al.,  2023;  Erickson  and  Smith,  2023).  We 
averaged  predictions  across  three  replicated  runs  for  each  model and 
selected model runs with a TSS > 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. 
We classified the predicted risk probabilities generated by the ensemble 
model  into  5  classes:  no-risk  areas  (< 0.2),  low-risk  areas  (0.2–0.4), 
moderate-risk areas (0.4–0.6), high-risk areas (0.6–0.8) and extreme risk 
areas (> 0.8).

Among the ten algorithms examined, SRE, CTA, and ANN exhibited 
the  lowest AUC and  TSS  values. The best-supported  models based  on 
both  AUC  and  TSS  were  GBM,  Maxent,  and  GLM  (Fig.  S5).  When 
considering the ensemble model, which aggregated predictions from all 
ten models, the weighted average AUC and TSS scores were 0.87 and 
0.62,  respectively,  underscoring  the  model’s  overall  good  discrimina-
tory power (Fig. S5). In terms of the factors contributing to conflict risk, 
the  ensemble model highlighted four primary  influencers: distance to 

villages (37%), distance to protected areas (18%), distance to farmland 
(16%), and human footprint (13%) (Fig. 3). Response curves of the top 
four predictors showed that conflict risk decreased with increasing dis-
tance to villages and protected areas, but showed a bell curve relation-
ship with distance to farmland and human footprint (Fig. 4) Fig. 5.)

butes (Lehner and Grill, 2013). The protected areas layers were down-
loaded  from  the  GeoData  application  of  the  General  Directorate  of 
Nature Conservation and National Parks of Türkiye (MOAF, 2019). The 
following categories of protected areas were extracted and used in our 
modeling  approach:  national  parks;  nature  conservation  areas;  special 
environment  protection  areas;  wildlife  enhancement  areas  (equivalent  to 
wildlife  refuges  or  reserves);  locally  important  wetlands;  nationally 
important wetlands; Ramsar wetlands; and preservation (protected) forests. 
Finally,  we  generated  distance  layers  for  all  our  variables  using  the 
Euclidean Distance tool in ArcGIS (ESRI Inc., USA).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the study aimed to construct a final ensemble conflict risk model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented in the biomod2 package. This process involved selecting model runs with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) greater than 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. Additionally, the authors mention that they averaged predictions across three replicated runs for each model. These steps suggest that some form of validation was performed to assess the performance of the models and select those with better accuracy. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the data preprocessing, training, and testing procedures, it is difficult to definitively state what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
