Description and Parameters

execute_all() method, by which a user can get all available data in the 
NASA server for a given product and location. The call of the methods 
execute_many,  execute_all,  and  their  respective  asynchronous  versions, 

According to the NASA specification, there is a limit of a maximum of 
ten dates per request. In order to avoid this limitation, the execute_many 
() method has been implemented. The execute_many() accepts the same

When  nasawebservice  has  to  deal  with  large  volume  of  requests,  the 
choice to use an iterator improves the memory management for the data

Once the VM is deployed, a Python 3.9 release was installed on the 
machine.  The  Python  interpreter  has  been  responsible  for  parallel 
execution of two nasawebservice processes, a static process, and a peri-
odic process. As best practice, each process is contained in a separate 
virtual environment, so the dependencies are isolated from the system, 
and reciprocally.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the information regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed step-by-step process about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, some general steps involved in deploying a machine learning or deep learning model include:

1. Serializing the model: This involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored and transferred between different environments. Common formats used for model serialization include pickle files (for Python models), ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, etc.

2. Selecting a platform: Once the model is serialized, it needs to be hosted on a suitable platform where it can receive input data and generate predictions. Some popular platforms for hosting machine learning models include AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, etc.

3. Deploying the model: After selecting a platform, the next step is to upload the serialized model onto the chosen platform and configure any necessary settings such as scaling policies, security permissions, etc.

Without further details about the specific tools, technologies, and procedures used in this case, I am unable to provide a more precise response.
