3. Materials and methods 

This section presents the tools and statistical models used to analyse 
the dependencies in this article. The first tool that was helpful in pre- 
processing  the  data  was  standardization  (Williamson  and  Piattoeva, 
2019). This is a kind of normalization that allows changing the scope of 
individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical 
range. It should be emphasized here that this transformation preserves 
the distance relations between individual data. Thus, suppose one have a 
set of records xj ∈ ℝn, j = 1, …, m where n is the number of features. For 
each element j = 1, …, m, the variables are transformed as follows:

6. Discussion

As described above, only 8 of the describing variables were adopted 
for the next tested model. In the M5 model, the alternative YNG_PCT was

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the input data into a specific range or distribution, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Scaling refers to rescaling the input data to reduce the impact of large differences in magnitude among different features. Cleaning involves removing noise from the input data, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. Standardization is also mentioned as a type of normalization that changes the scale of individual variables while preserving their distance relationships. This technique is useful for datasets with multiple features having different scales.
