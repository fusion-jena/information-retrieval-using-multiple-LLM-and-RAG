2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

2.4. Evaluation metrics 

During  the  cross-validation  approach,  samples  are  split  such  that 
each sample training may be used to validate the model. Increasing the 
statistical dependability of the outcomes is the major goal of this tech-
nique. There are several different cross-validation techniques, including 
k-fold, leave-one-out, and Monte Carlo methods (Abd El-Samie, 2000). 
A model’s performance was assessed using the pixel accuracy (ACC) 
and  point  of  intersection  (POI).  Every  iteration,  both  values  were

Helpful Answer:

According to the given context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: Pixel Accuracy (ACC) and Point of Intersection (POI). These evaluation metrics are mentioned in section 2.4 titled "Evaluation Metrics". However, it should be noted that the context does not provide specific details about how these metrics are calculated or what they represent.

Pixel Accuracy (ACC) could refer to a common metric used in image segmentation tasks where the number of correctly classified pixels is divided by the total number of pixels. This gives an overall measure of the model's ability to accurately classify individual pixels.

Point of Intersection (POI) might refer to a metric used in binary classification problems, which is also known as the Threshold or Operating Point. It represents the value at which the False Positive Rate (FPR) equals the True Positive Rate (TPR). In other words, POI can help determine the optimal threshold for converting probabilities into class labels while balancing sensitivity and specificity.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention any other commonly used evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we can only conclude that the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (ACC) and Point of Intersection (POI).
