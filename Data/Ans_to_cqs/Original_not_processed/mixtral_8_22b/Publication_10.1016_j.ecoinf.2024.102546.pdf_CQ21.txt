5. Discussion

jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements random crop 
and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly 
with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 
800  Ã— 800  pixels,  which  is  compatible  with  model  architectures  and 
training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of 
each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the 
original image aspect ratio. All models were trained for 40 epochs with 
batch  size  8,  which  could  adequately  converge  based  on  empirical 
observations.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or accuracy, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib. These steps help evaluate the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.
