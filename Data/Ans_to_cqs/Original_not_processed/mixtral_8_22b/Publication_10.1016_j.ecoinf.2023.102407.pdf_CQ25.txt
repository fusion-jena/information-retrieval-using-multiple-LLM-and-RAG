et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacher–student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among

In the ML domain, SSL refers to an approach that aims to improve the 
performance  and  robustness  of  a  model  for  the  target  task  (e.g., 
regression or classification) by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled 
data (Van Engelen and Hoos, 2020). Therefore, in the context of species 
distribution modeling, we generalize SSL as follows. Given an environ-
mental  dataset  X  and  an  observational  dataset  Y,  we  can  define  two 
types of data point set: a set of labeled data points DL  and a set of un-
labeled data points DU. DL consists of data points (xi, yi) where xi ∈ X is 
the input variable that describes the environmental information for site 
i,  and  yi  ∈ Y  is  the  output  variable  that  indicates  whether  the  target 
species  is  present  at  site  i  (labeled  1  if  present,  0  if  not  present).  DU 
consists of data points (xi, yi) where yi is unknown. In other words, we 
configure all sites with observational data within the target area as DL

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the text that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification tasks related to species distribution modeling. Specifically, the model appears to be part of a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework, which aims to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance and robustness in the target task. In this case, the target task involves determining the presence or absence of a particular species at various sites based on environmental information. The labeled data points consist of pairs of input variables describing environmental information and output variables indicating the presence or absence of the target species. Unlabeled data points also contain input variables but lack corresponding output variables. By employing a deep learning model within this SSL framework, researchers hope to enhance their ability to accurately predict species distributions across diverse habitats while minimizing potential issues such as bias and overfitting.
