4.2.2 Data distribution  

In the machine learning literature, much research has focused on problems with imbalanced data 
(He  &  Garcia,  2009).  Previous  studies  have  noted  that  imbalanced  data  would  make  the 
significant negative impact on CNN models (J. N. Wang et al., 2017). To compare balanced data 
performance with imbalanced data, we used data resampling in training a new model. The new 
model covered six classes, where the classes are evenly distributed. Validation accuracy was only 
94% because the data size has decreased (Masko & Hensman, 2015). The recognition rate for the 
family Hesperiidae increased, and the other rates have changed at the same time (Table 3). 

We used images of six butterfly families to make our dataset because the image size and number 
are similar. The biological classification of these butterflies is recognized by taxonomists (M. Q. 
Zhou et al., 2006), so we can only use these known categories to make labels.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data resampling. This technique involves adjusting the class distribution of the dataset to create a more balanced representation of each class. In this case, the authors used data resampling to create a new model with six evenly distributed classes. However, this resulted in a decrease in validation accuracy due to the smaller data size. Another approach mentioned in the context is the use of diverse data collection methods, such as collecting images of six different butterfly families with similar image sizes and numbers. This ensures that the dataset is representative of all classes and reduces any potential bias towards certain classes. Additionally, the authors note that it is possible to use small datasets to train deep learning models effectively, as long as the proper parameters are selected. Overall, the context suggests that addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of class distribution and diversity within the dataset.
