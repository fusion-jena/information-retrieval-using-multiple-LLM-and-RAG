and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the 
automatic  recognition  of  woody  regrowth  vegetation  in  repeat  land-
scape  photographs. By comparing  the changes between repeat  photo-
graphs, planners and designers can identify general trends of landscape 
change.  Although  these  image-based  methods  are  powerful  tools  to 
assess and track landscape visual quality, design projects’ aesthetic and 
scientific meaning may be transformed or lost during the modification 
and  application  process  in  the  widely  used  visualization  tools,  like 
Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max (Urech et al., 2020). Moreover, image- 
based  methods  fail  to  capture  or  represent  some  spatial attributes  (e. 
g.,  volumes),  which  is  also  a  key  component  within  the  landscape 
composition. Extracting and representing spatial attributes from the 3D

reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, they provide insights into various applications of deep learning models in landscape analysis and design. For example, Cheshmehzangi (2016) uses computational simulations for integrated urban design, while Guo et al. (2023) construct 3D landscape indexes based on oblique photogrammetry. Ho (2023) introduces LaDeco, a tool to analyze visual landscape elements. These studies suggest that different types of data might require unique annotation techniques depending on the problem domain and objectives. Therefore, it is essential to choose appropriate data annotation techniques based on the research goals and available resources.
