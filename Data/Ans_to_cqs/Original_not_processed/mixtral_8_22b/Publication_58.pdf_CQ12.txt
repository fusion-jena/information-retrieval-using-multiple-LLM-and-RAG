To run an XGBoost model, neo-channels and multiple texture ﬁlters were used. The
ﬁlters were: dissimilarity, entropy, homogeneity and mean. Input of 64 × 64 windows
were used for labeling the central pixel. The training data were the same as for the Deep
Learning architectures.

3.3. Deep Learning Architectures

The internal parameters of the employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were not changed with regards to the originally proposed ones. A CNN [40]
is a machine learning technique based on sequences of layers of three different types:
convolutional, pooling or fully connected layers. Convolution and fully connected layers
are usually followed by an element-wise, non-linear activation function.

ResNet (Deep Residual Network, [43]) is a Deep Learning architecture with many
layers that use skip connections, as illustrated in Figure 4. These skip connections allow
the bypassing of layers and add their activations to those of the skipped layers further
down the sequence. The dotted arrows in Figure 4 denote skip connections through a linear
projection to adapt to the channel depth.

By skipping layers and thus shortening the back-propagation path, the problem of the
“vanishing gradient” can be mitigated. Figure 4 represents a 34-layer ResNet architecture.
The ﬁrst layer uses 7 × 7 convolutions, the remaining ones 3 × 3.

For the LU detection task, all deep learning techniques except AlexNet outperformed
XGBoost. Differences were signiﬁcant, with up to 15 percent points in OA. As in the
previous section, the best performing “single-pixel” architecture is DenseNet and the best
“semantic labeling” network is DeepLab. Interestingly, DenseNet reached the best PA,
although DeepLab dominated the remaining metrics.

For the remainder of this study, the best performing “single-pixel” and “semantic
labeling” were selected. There was little difference between the architectures, so the
architectures with the best F1-score for the LU classiﬁcation were chosen arbitrarily.

4.4. Confusion Matrix of the Best Deep Learning Model for LULC Classiﬁcation

The results of the best performing architecture for the LULC classiﬁcation task,
DeepLab, is detailed with two confusion matrices. Table 10 shows The LC classiﬁca-
tion task with the raw channels as input, and the LU classiﬁcation task with the LCE in
addition to the raw channels, is in Table 11. The resulting maps of the LU labelling task are
shown in Figure 9.

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, the paper mentions using a CNN architecture without changing its internal parameters from the original proposal. Additionally, it discusses the use of other deep learning architectures such as ResNet (which is also a form of CNN), but does not mention any Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers. Therefore, we can conclude that the primary type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is CNN.
