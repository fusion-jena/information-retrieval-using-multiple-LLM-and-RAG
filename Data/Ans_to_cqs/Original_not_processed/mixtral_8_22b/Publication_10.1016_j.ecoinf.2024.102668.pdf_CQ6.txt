3.  Differences gains among recording devices: The signal amplitude of a 
microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone may 
capture. This depends on the manufacturing materials and its level of 
degradation.  Significant  differences  in  gain  are  expected  from  mi-
crophones of different brands or after severe outdoor use.

Helpful Answer:
The paper proposes a preprocessing methodology consisting of three steps before training a deep learning model. These steps aim to address various challenges such as noise interference, frequency range limitations, and differences in gain among recording devices.

Step 1 involves applying a bandpass filter to remove unwanted frequencies outside the desired range. This step is crucial because many bioacoustics signals have specific frequency ranges, and removing irrelevant frequencies can improve the model's performance.

Step 2 focuses on reducing background noise by using spectral subtraction methods. Background noise can significantly affect the quality of the recorded sounds, making it difficult for the model to learn meaningful patterns. By minimizing this noise, the model can better focus on relevant features.

Finally, Step 3 involves normalizing the signal amplitude. As mentioned earlier, significant differences in gain are expected from microphones of different brands or after severe outdoor use. To ensure consistency across recordings, normalizing the signal amplitude helps maintain uniformity in the dataset used for training the deep learning model.

These preprocessing steps play a vital role in preparing the data for training a deep learning model. They help reduce noise interference, limit the frequency range to relevant values, and normalize the signal amplitude, ensuring consistent input for the model.
