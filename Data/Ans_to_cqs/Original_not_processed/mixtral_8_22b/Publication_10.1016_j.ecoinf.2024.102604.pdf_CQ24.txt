on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018).

The final step involves sampling the distribution of virtual species 
and  introducing  a  sampling  bias.  We  simulated  two  common  biases 
encountered in actual surveys:  

• Observation station bias (OS bias). We used the kernel density of 
plant  species  records  obtained 
from  GBIF  (https://doi.org/ 
10.15468/dl.p3pwxa) for Yunnan Province as the sampling weight. 
Consequently,  the  present-point  sampling  was  limited  to  a  few 
observation stations (Fig. 3a).

Helpful Answer:
Strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like ensemble methods or cross-validation to average out the effects of randomness, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. However, it should be noted that some level of randomness may still exist due to factors such as hardware variability or software updates.

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide general strategies used to address this issue. Some commonly employed strategies include:

1. Setting fixed seeds: By setting a fixed seed value, one can ensure that the results generated from different runs of the same model remain consistent. This helps in achieving reproducibility in experiments.

2. Ensemble methods: These methods involve training multiple models independently and then combining their predictions to produce a final output. Using ensemble methods can help mitigate the impact of randomness since they aggregate the outputs of several models, reducing the influence of individual random components.

3. Cross-validation: This technique involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and iteratively training the model on each subset while validating it on the remaining ones. Cross-validation allows for averaging out the effects of randomness by evaluating the model's performance over various combinations of training and validation sets.

4. Deterministic algorithms: Wherever possible, opting for deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones can eliminate sources of randomness within the deep learning pipeline.
