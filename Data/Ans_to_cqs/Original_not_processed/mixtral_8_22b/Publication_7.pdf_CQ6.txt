Image representations extracted from deep neural networks,
trained on large datasets such as ImageNet [9] and ﬁne tuned
on domain speciﬁc datasets, have shown state-of-art perfor-
mance in numerous image classiﬁcation problems [14]. The
activation vectors of the ﬁrst fully connected layer of a pre-
trained VGGnet [24] are employed as feature representations
in our work. The weights of this deep network are ﬁne tuned
using the Benthoz15 dataset [23] which consists of expert-
annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian
seas.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [9], also known as
deep networks, are an important class of machine learning
algorithms applicable, among others, to numerous computer
vision problems. Deep CNNs, in particular, are composed of
multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-
linear operators. To solve a particular task, the parameters of
networks are learned in an end-to-end manner. Image represen-
tations extracted from deep CNNs trained on a large dataset
such as ImageNet [10] have shown to produce a promising
performance for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition tasks
[11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)
[16] and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) [17] schemes
have made CNNs independent of the input image size and
robust for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition applications.
In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of

The image representations extracted at these three scales were
then max-pooled to retain the most prominent information
which is present in the neighbourhood of a labelled pixel.
These multi-scale deep features were used to train a Multi
Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classiﬁcation. This net-
work consists of two fully connected hidden layers of neurons
followed by an output layer with 2 nodes: corals and non-
corals. The number of neurons in the hidden layers were
optimized for maximum performance. Fig. 3 shows the block
diagram of our proposed classiﬁcation method.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation was done since the authors utilized a pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tuned its weights using the Benthoz15 dataset. Additionally, they extracted activation vectors from the first fully connected layer of the VGGnet to serve as feature representations. These feature representations were then processed through spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which could be considered part of the preprocessing step. Lastly, the resulting multi-scale deep features were used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the preprocessing steps likely included extracting relevant features from the raw data and applying appropriate pooling techniques to prepare the data for training the deep learning model.
