2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

overall accuracy (OA) as metrics. We adjusted three
parameters (voxel size is the voxelization subsampling
size, the regularization strength inﬂuences the coarseness
of the minimal partition, and batch size means the batch
number of point cloud samples in training). We used the
hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training
set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. We
further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the

inﬂuence of parameters on experimental results, and we
discuss the selection of the frame parameters.

Selection of the Frame Parameters

We investigated the effects of several parameters in our
framework, such as the regularization strength, voxel size
for the minimal partition, and training batch size. In

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. These may vary depending on the specific application or requirements of the project. However, based on the given context, it appears that the following postprocessing steps are taken:

1. Point Cloud Test Set Segmentation: After the model has been trained, the point cloud test set is segmented. This involves dividing the test set into smaller segments or regions for further analysis.

2. Obtain Final Segmentation Results: Once the test set has been segmented, the final segmentation results can be obtained. These results provide information about how well the model was able to classify different objects within the point cloud dataset.

3. Output Files Generation: Several output files are generated during this stage, including point cloud geometric partition graphs, Superpoint Graphs (SPGs), and segmentation results. These files contain detailed information about the segmentation results and can be used for further analysis or visualization purposes.

In addition to these steps, other common postprocessing tasks may also be performed, such as calculating evaluation metrics like overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), generating saliency maps to highlight important features in the input data, and creating confusion matrices to compare predicted labels against actual labels. However, the given context does not explicitly mention any of these additional tasks being carried out.
