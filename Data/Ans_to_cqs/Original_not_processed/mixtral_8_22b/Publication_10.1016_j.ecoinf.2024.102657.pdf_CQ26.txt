grams, and created the metadata .csv file necessary for training the CNN 
and k-NN. Identical in structure to the metadata file outlined above, this 
file contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the met-
adata for the entire dataset. 

No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the 
goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to 
demonstrate  the  power  of  human-machine  teaming.  Further,  when 
assessing the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data, 
the accuracy levels were similar: after 10 trials, the CNNâ€™s accuracy on 
the  filtered  data  averaged  to  99.22%  and  the  accuracy  on  the  non- 
filtered data averaged to 99.25%.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a few aspects related to handling the dataset. For instance, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split ratio. This approach ensures that both sets contain representative samples from all dialect classes, which can help mitigate potential biases due to uneven distribution of classes. Additionally, the use of identical structures for metadata files suggests consistency in data organization across different subsets, further reducing the risk of introducing any systematic biases. While these practices contribute to maintaining balance within the dataset, they do not directly correspond to common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection mentioned in the query. Therefore, based solely on the given context, we cannot definitively state which specific technique(s) are employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing.
