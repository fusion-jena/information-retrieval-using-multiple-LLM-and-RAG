3.2.2.3. Label-only  (Choquette-Choo  et  al.,  2021). Rather  than  using 
confidence predictions, query-based attacks restrict the attack to using 
only the predicted labels from the target model. More precisely, label- 
only attacks determine membership status by issuing multiple queries 
to the target model. In practice, these queries are obtained by applying 
adversarial  perturbations  to  the  input  sample  until  a  change  in  the 
predicted label occurs. The attack assesses the perturbation’s size and 
categorizes  a  data  sample  as  a  member  if  its  magnitude  surpasses  a 
predefined threshold. More formally, if we have an estimate dist(x, y)
representing a point’s l2-distance from the model’s boundary, the attack 
predicts that x is a member when dist(x, y) ≥ τ, in which τ is a specific 
threshold value.

inference, we randomly selected specific supervised samples to serve as 
reference images, with a number of 25 samples per individual. This is the

distribution” for the non-members in the attack dataset. In practice, this 
can have a big impact in the situation in which the target dataset is of 
limited size and we do want to sacrifice some of its data to build the 
attack dataset.
