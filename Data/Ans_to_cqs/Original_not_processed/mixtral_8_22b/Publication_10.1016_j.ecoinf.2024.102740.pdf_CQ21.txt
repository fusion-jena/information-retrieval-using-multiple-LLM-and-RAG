System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad,

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the given dataset and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table layout that allows visualizing the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visualizations that highlight the pixels in the input image that contribute significantly towards the output prediction made by the model. These maps provide insights into what features the model focuses on during decision making.

4. Feature Importance: This step involves identifying the most important features that contributed towards the final predictions made by the model. Techniques like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, etc., can be used for this purpose.

5. Model Deployment: Once the model evaluation and interpretation have been completed, the next step would be deploying the model in a real-world scenario. This could involve integrating it with existing systems, creating APIs, etc.
