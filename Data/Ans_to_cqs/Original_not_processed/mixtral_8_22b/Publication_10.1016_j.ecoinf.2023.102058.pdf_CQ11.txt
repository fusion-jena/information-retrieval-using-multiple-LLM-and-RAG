Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

Remote Sens. 13, 718. <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13040718>. This paper presents a deep learning approach for estimating chlorophyll a concentrations in inland water bodies using simulated WASI data. However, the article does not explicitly state where the underlying data can be accessed.

Environ. 36, 67–72. <https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(91)90031-Z>. This study investigates the relationship between spectral reflectance and total suspended solids in water samples collected from various locations in Brazil. While the article provides valuable insights into the use of remote sensing techniques for water quality monitoring, it does not specify a data repository link for the experimental results.
