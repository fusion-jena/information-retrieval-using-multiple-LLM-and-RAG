Finally, as the main measure for the convenience of model fit, the 
mean  absolute  difference  of  the  predicted  value  from  the  measured 
value was used. This enabled the use of one model measure for all three 
approaches. The evaluation was performed on “test dataset” records for 
all three modelling approaches. 

All computations were performed in R 4.0.2 (R Core Team, 2020) 
using a selected alpha level of 0.05, together with the packages readxl 
(Wickham  and  Bryan,  2019),  tidyverse  (Wickham  et  al.,  2019),  and 
reshape2 (Wickham, 2007). Plots were constructed using corrplot (Wei 
and Simko, 2017) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). The artificial neural net 
was fitted using the Keras package in Python 3.8. 

3. Results and discussion

To achieve the utmost accuracy, a test was completed by engaging 
the artificial ANN. Only Cb and Cr were used as the input variables since 
they were considered the most sensitive variables during the two pre-
ceding testing stages. Thus, the simple ANN was fitted with two inputs 
and one output, as the addition of any hidden layers returned less ac-
curacy of the prediction on the test data due to overfitting. The results 
were  considered  comparable  in  terms  of  accuracy  as  the  previous 
methods. The mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value 
measurements  was  1.904  (95%  CI:  1.89–1.92),  while  the  best  “run” 
showed a mean deviation of 1.70 (max. 2.22, 95% CI, one-sided t-test). 
All three modelling approaches could be incorporated in the source 
code at this stage to provide the SPAD value estimate for the following 
rapeseed measurements. However, LM was concluded to be the simplest 
method with a high level of accuracy. A complex overview of the plant

As  the  third  approach  for  SPAD  value  modelling  based  on  the 
Rasp2SPAD indices, an artificial neural network was implemented. The 
same predictors as in the previously described LM and GLM were uti-
lized. All predictors were scaled prior to analysis. The ANN  was con-
structed empirically, with the first layer containing two input nodes (one 
per each of the two parameters that were found to be the most suitable 
by LM and GLM) and the last layer containing only one node (predicted 
SPAD value). As the fit of the ANN does not give the same output for 
each run  (because of a random number generator used for numerical 
optimization of the model), 100 successful runs were performed, and the 
model residuals obtained in each run were analysed for a more reliable 
evaluation of the model performance.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the evaluation was performed on "test dataset" records for all three modeling approaches, which suggests some form of validation process. Additionally, the fact that the artificial neural network was fitted using the Keras package in Python implies that standard practices for training and validating deep learning models may have been followed. Nonetheless, without explicit information about these practices, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
