For the ViT models, we adapted the approach of pretraining deep
bidirectional transformers for language understanding (BERT) by Devlin
et al. (2018) for birdsong classification. Table 3 provides an overview of
the investigated ViT models with their respective parameterizations.
ViT-S/16, for example, denotes a ViT variant of reduced complexity with
an input patch size of 16 × 16. The sequence length of the transformer
models is inversely proportional to the square of the provided patch size.
In the following, ViT-B/16 is further investigated as it strikes a balance
between general model complexity and classification performance.

Overview of our augmentation strategies, their IDs, and related information. For DenseNet-161 and ViT-B/16, their training times are provided in minutes per epoch
for the different augmentation methods. For IDs 5 and 6, we added noise of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge (Berger et al., 2018; Himawan
et al., 2018; Liaqat et al., 2018), which is abbreviated as BAD.

In order to alleviate the effects of present class imbalances, the focal
loss was introduced to the training process. To reduce the impact of
computational costs within the context of the BirdCLEF challenge in
terms of model runtime, our augmentation techniques were applied to
the training samples with a probability factor 50%. Therefore, future
investigations should also assess the differences in classification capa-
bilities when different probabilities are compared with each other.
When further assessing the resulting training and testing times in
Table 3, it is evident that the improved performance of ViT-B/16 comes
at a cost of increased training times by a factor of about 2.3 as well as
increased testing times by a factor of about 3.9. The observed data
augmentation trends – for increasing and decreasing classification ca-
pabilities – are merely robust against the investigated models. There-
fore, future investigations focusing on augmentation strategies should

training or validation progress could be observed. To fine-tune our ViT
models, we deployed ImageNet-based weights for pretraining.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details regarding the specific criteria used to split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets for the deep learning models. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible criteria include:

1. Random splitting: This involves randomly dividing the entire dataset into three subsets - training, testing, and validation. A typical ratio might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

2. Stratified sampling: In this method, the dataset is divided such that the distribution of classes remains consistent across all subsets. This ensures that the model gets exposed to a representative sample of each class during both training and evaluation phases.

3. Time-series splitting: When dealing with temporal datasets, it is essential to maintain the chronological order while creating splits. Typically, earlier data points are allocated for training, followed by validation and then testing.

4. Cross-validation: This technique involves partitioning the original dataset into 'k' equal-sized subsamples or folds. Each fold serves as the validation set once, while the remaining k-1 folds form the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring every observation has been part of the validation set exactly once.

Without additional context, it cannot be determined which of these methods, if any, were employed for splitting the dataset in this particular case.
