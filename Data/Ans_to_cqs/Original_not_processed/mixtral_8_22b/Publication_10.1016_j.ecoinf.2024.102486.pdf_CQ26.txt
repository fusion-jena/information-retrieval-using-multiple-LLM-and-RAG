et al., 2022) are likely to reduce overall compute time by allowing each 
thread  to  produce  a  sample  independently.  However,  as  these  algo-
rithms are only asymptotically unbiased, they may not be optimal for 
applications  that  require  resampling  from  highly  skewed  probability 
distributions, as these will necessitate many iterations to produce suf-
ficiently unbiased samples, increasing compute time.

In  many  computational  statistics  algorithms,  including  particle 
filtering, resampling indices across a large set of data occurs regularly 
(such as in line 5 of Algorithm 1), and occupies a significant proportion 
of  the  total  compute  time.  The  choice  of  resampling  algorithm  is 
important, as algorithms that have efficient CPU-only implementations 
do  not  necessarily  remain  efficient  when  calculations  are  performed 
using  GPUs.  In  particular,  the  rejection  algorithm  for  multinomial 
resampling is prone to warp divergence, as threads in the same warp 
must  wait  for  all  others  to  have  accepted  a  sample  before  they  can 
proceed  to  generating  the  following sample).  More  examples of  warp 
divergence are detailed in Appendix B. Efficient alternatives such as the 
Metropolis resampler (whose GPU-parallel performance is examined in 
detail  by  Murray  et  al.  (2016))  or  the  Megopolis  resampler  (Chesser

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide direct information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses various aspects related to computational statistics algorithms, particle filtering, and resampling methods.

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets called strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the original class distribution. It helps prevent imbalanced classes during training and testing phases.

2. Oversampling: To counteract class imbalance, this method increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones using interpolation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Overpopulation Technique).

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, this approach reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing some instances or employing more sophisticated techniques like NearMiss or Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a wide range of data with varying characteristics can help mitigate biases introduced due to limited representation within certain groups or categories. This includes gathering data from different sources, demographics, geographical locations, etc.
