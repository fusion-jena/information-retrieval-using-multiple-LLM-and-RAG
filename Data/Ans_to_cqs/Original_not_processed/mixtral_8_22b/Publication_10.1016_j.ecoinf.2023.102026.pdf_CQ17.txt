Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  (RF;  Breiman 
(2001)) is the most commonly used algorithm (Stupariu et al., 2021). RF 
are  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART)  based  ensemble  ap-
proaches,  which  overcome  limitations  of  CARTs  such  as  model  over- 
fitting.  Additionally,  RF  can  handle  large  numbers  of  predictor  vari-
ables  without  being  affected  by  multicollinearity,  and  can  readily 
accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response 
variables  (Breiman,  2001;  Evans  and  Cushman,  2009;  Kumar  et  al., 
2021). Furthermore, by permutation of variables, RF provides accessible 
measures of variable importance (Cutler et al., 2007; Evans and Cush-
man, 2009).

To produce accurate SDMs, not just the effects of different algorithms 
should be investigated, but also the effects of resampling techniques on 
model's  training  data  (Efron,  1982;  Freedman,  1981).  Specifically, 
bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement) the training 
data  has  been  shown  to  increase  models'  precision  by  providing  a 
combination of models, which reduces stochastic errors in estimation (e. 
g., Vaughan and Ormerod (2005); Hefley et al. (2014); Xu and Goodacre 
(2018)).

4.2. Scaling hypotheses

A key point in machine learning is represented by the data, not only 
by the algorithms. The structure of the training data can have profound 
and critical effects on the outcomes of models trained with the RF al-
gorithm. While this is an important point which is worthy of evaluation, 
our dataset was limited to a collection of camera trap data on several 
species which makes it difficult to comprehensively compare the effects 
of the data and its structure. We note that this is better explored with 
simulation, as in a recent paper from our group (Kumar et al., 2021) 
which  indeed  showed  that  the  spatial  pattern  and  shape  of  the  envi-
ronmental manifold itself affects performance of GLM and RF.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that Random Forest (RF), a popular machine learning technique, helps overcome limitations of Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs), including model overfitting. This suggests that using ensemble approaches like RF can help mitigate overfitting issues.

In general, regularization methods are employed to reduce overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization method for neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models, reducing the risk of overfitting. These methods are typically applied within the deep learning pipeline to improve model generalization.
