training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

Deep learning-based denoising methods are most commonly applied 
to  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  such  as  a  human  speech 
enhancement. D´efossez et al. (Defossez et al., 2020) demonstrated the 
potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) performance and be applied in sub-real time on limited hard-
ware. These methods commonly operate on audio spectrograms but in 
recent  years  SOTA  deep  learning  methods  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  have 
successfully  used  raw  waveform  data  (Luo and  Mesgarani,  2019; Luo 
and Mesgarani, 2023) for wider applications such as source separation 
and classification. This removes errors introduced when applying a Fast 
Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  to  generate  a  time-frequency  representation 
and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. These 
networks tend to require more data for training as the latent space must

be  established  (Xie  et  al.,  2021).  Deep  noise  reduction  methods 
(Defossez et al., 2020) often use a U-net architecture which consists of an 
encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent 
space representation. The decoder then uses this latent space to recon-
struct the denoised waveform. Recently, transformer attention mecha-
nisms have also been applied with great success (Cao et al., 2022; Luo 
and  Mesgarani,  2019;  Luo  and  Mesgarani,  2023;  Zhang  et  al.,  2022; 
Zhao et al., 2022). As most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP 
applications, models are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 
22  kHz.  Bioacoustics  applications  commonly  exceed  this  bandwidth. 
Additionally, the sparsity of vocalisations in this application and many 
other  bioacoustics  applications  makes  the  development  of  large-scale 
datasets  infeasible  (Stowell,  2021).  These  factors  limit  the  success  of

5.2. Ablation studies 

Data  requirements  are  a  key  consideration  for  many  monitoring 
applications  given  the  lack  of  existing  datasets.  Audio  enhancement 
models  require  training  data  for  fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning  does  not 
necessarily require large datasets. Section 4.1.2 demonstrate that similar 
performance could be achieved using a subset of 100 training examples. 
Data  augmentation  techniques  such  as  superimposing  noise  samples 
should  also  be  considered  as  bioacoustics  applications  typically  have 
abundant  noise  features.  Both  WPD  and  spectral  subtraction  do  not 
require training data.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation. However, it does discuss some aspects related to data preparation and requirements for deep learning-based denoising methods, particularly in the field of bioacoustic applications.

In general, the process of splitting data involves dividing the available dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance.

When preparing data for deep learning-based denoising methods, collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles is common practice. In bioacoustics applications, obtaining clean recordings might be challenging or even impossible, making the collection of suitable training data difficult. Additionally, the scarcity of vocalizations in these applications limits the creation of extensive datasets.

Regarding data requirements, the text mentions that fine-tuning deep learning models doesn't necessarily need large datasets. It suggests that similar performance can be achieved using a subset of only 100 training examples. Moreover, data augmentation techniques, such as superimposing noise samples, should be considered since bioacoustic applications usually contain abundant noise features.

While the text does not directly address the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it highlights important considerations regarding data collection, preparation, and requirements for deep learning-based denoising methods in bioacoustic applications.
