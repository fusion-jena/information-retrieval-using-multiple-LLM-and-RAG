4.2. Landscape type classification 

The  five  network  models  were  evaluated  using  the  performance 
metrics  of  the  validation  and  test  sets.  The  model  accuracy  was 
continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the 
performance of the testing set guided the final decision. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the  learning  curves,  indicating  a  reduction  in  training  losses  as  the 
number  of  epochs  increases  and  convergence  within  500  epochs. 
Inceptionv3  converges  by  400  epochs,  while  the  other  networks 
converge  within  150  epochs.  The  ResNet  architecture,  especially 
ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforms the others.

To ensure the stability of the proposed models, we randomly divided 
the  dataset  into  three  parts:  training  (60%),  validation  (20%),  and 
testing  (20%)  (Meng  et  al.,  2022).  This  division  was  performed  in  a 
stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. 
The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (2880 images), a 
validation set (961 images), and a testing set (958 images). The models 
were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 Ã— 256 image input 
size. After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of 
epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.

based on performance metrics was employed to predict the rural land-
scape classifications in the study area. The classification with the highest 
likelihood  was  allocated  to  each  sample  based  on  the  predicted 
probabilities.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Training completion is typically determined by monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation set during training. In this case, the model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training. The learning curves shown in Figure 6 indicate a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases and convergence within 500 epochs. Specifically, Inceptionv3 converged by 400 epochs, while the other networks converged within 150 epochs. Additionally, the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperformed the others. Therefore, it can be concluded that the criteria used to determine when training is complete include observing a decrease in training losses, convergence of the model, and achieving satisfactory performance on the validation set.
