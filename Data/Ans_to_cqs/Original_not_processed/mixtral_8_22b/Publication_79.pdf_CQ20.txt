Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. The context discusses various aspects related to remote sensing and deep learning techniques applied to classifying Brazilian Savanna physiognomies but does not provide details regarding the hardware resources employed during the training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this context.
