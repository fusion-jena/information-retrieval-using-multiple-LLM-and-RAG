3.2. Performance of the models and forecast distribution 

The  mean  accuracies  and  standard  deviations  of  the  5  × 10-fold 
cross-validations  for  each  method  and  species  are  shown  in  Table  4. 
Random Forest is the method that achieves the highest accuracy for all 
the analysed species (0.718 for SKJ, 0.728 for YFT, 0.589 for BET and 
0.842 for FAL). Consequently, this is the method that has been used to 
build the prediction models. 

A  model  has  been  trained  for  each  species,  by  using  the  selected 
variables in Table 3. Then, for each model, the probabilities of finding 
high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area have 
been predicted by using the corresponding predictors given in Table 3. 
The results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5,

Helpful Answer:
None of the provided sources directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, some general principles can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines. One common strategy is to use cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, which helps reduce overfitting and provides more robust performance estimates. Another approach is to set a fixed random seed before training the model, ensuring reproducibility across different runs. Additionally, ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.
