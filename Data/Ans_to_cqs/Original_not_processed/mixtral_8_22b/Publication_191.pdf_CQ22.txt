deeper, its optimization capability can be further improved. How- 
ever, deep CNN networks require very large amounts of training 
data. Table 6 shows examples of existing well-known datasets and 
their size as quantity of images. The biggest plant database that 
we  have  found  is  the  PlantClef2015  dataset  [6]  which  has  only 
around 113,205 number of images. This is still far from matching 
the scale and variety of existing general major datasets for images 
[51,52,55] , videos [53] or languages [54] . In addition, we can see 
that the PlantClef2015 dataset [6] has one of the largest number 
of object categories but the least number of images. For example, 
compared to the ILSVRC 2010 dataset [55] , it has less than 10% of 
their total images but the same number of categories. Hence, to

the performance of CNN features with other state-of-the-art meth- 
ods. Then, we delve into qualitative analysis of the ﬁlter response 
in each convolution layer through the DN approach [36] . 

5.1. Quantitative analysis

the parameter setting in training, we employ ﬁxed learning policy. 
We set the learning rate to 10 −3 , and then decrease it by a fac- 
tor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. The 
momentum is set to 0.9 and weight decay to 10 −4 . In this experi- 
ment, we compute the top-1 classiﬁcation accuracy as described in 
Section 4.3 .

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that the top-1 classification accuracy is computed during the experiment. Top-1 accuracy is a common metric used in image classification tasks, where the prediction is considered correct if the highest probability class matches the true label. Other possible metrics could include precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC), depending on the nature of the task and the desired balance between false positives and false negatives. Without more information about the specific application and goals of the model, it is difficult to determine which additional metrics might be relevant.
