3.3. SRS data

Beyond obtaining satellite images with high-quality geometric and 
radiometric  information,  many  biogeophysical  parameters  have  been 
obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos 
et  al.,  2019;  Yang  et  al.,  2013).  For  instance,  from  the  spatial  and 
spectral ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer)  sensor,  44  different  standard  data  products  have 
been developed and are classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere 
and  Ocean  products  (Justice  et  al.,  2002).  Moreover,  the  continuous 
development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-

resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on 
these Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same 
world  region  around  the  same  hour  (see  Table  2)  and  having  a  high

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the crawling tool was developed to gather historical and near real-time data from various Space Remote Sensing (SRS) products. These products include data sourced from both ESA and NASA, containing crucial parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The focus is primarily on Sentinel-3 related products due to their ability to provide daily data from the same world region around the same time, which is essential for developing a monitoring system. Therefore, while we cannot pinpoint the exact dataset names, we can infer that the datasets consist of remote sensing data from satellites like MODIS and OLCI, focusing on parameters relevant to oceanography and atmospheric studies.
