the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

(DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
which are able to extract abstract high level features from images.
Identifying objects within the image and classifying them may
be treated as separate tasks. Yet, more recent methods, such as
“Faster R-CNN” (Ren et al., 2015), and YOLO (Redmon et al.,
2016) consider both problems at the same time.

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses deep learning models for object detection and classification tasks, specifically referring to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and methods like Faster R-CNN and YOLO. These methods typically employ bounding box annotation or instance segmentation techniques for identifying and localizing objects within images. Bounding boxes enclose objects with rectangular boundaries, while instance segmentation involves outlining individual instances of objects at pixel level. Therefore, it can be inferred that the study likely utilizes either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation techniques, depending on the chosen method and its requirements.
