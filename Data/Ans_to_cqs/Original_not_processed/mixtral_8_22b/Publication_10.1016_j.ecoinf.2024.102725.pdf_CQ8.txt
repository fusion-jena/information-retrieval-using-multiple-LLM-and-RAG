This article presents a new high-quality NDVI image product and a
technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high
spatial resolution. This framework offers a feasible method for recon-
structing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM
technology framework, we successfully produce a Sentinel-2 normalized
NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth
physiological cycles. The key concept of the algorithm is the introduc-
tion of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates
optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial
and temporal dimensions. By minimizing the sum of squares of the
combined prediction errors within a specific time period, the algorithm
achieves an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel
scale. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial feature
information of two prediction models, providing a robust approach for
