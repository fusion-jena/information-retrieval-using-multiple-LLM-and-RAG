Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

We evaluated the model performance utilising leave-one-out cross- 
validation, (LOOCV) approach. In the LOOCV approach, one observa-
tion at a time is extracted from the dataset and the model parameters are 
estimated  using  the  remaining  (n-1)  observations.  The  model  is  then 
applied to the extracted observation. 

3. Results 

The  GEDI  data  and  the  available  field  data  did  not  coincide 
geographically or in size. Thus, we have compared the GEDI L4A AGBD 
footprint values with AGBD estimated from the Sentinel-2 models. We 
also compared the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field 
data and GEDI data, respectively to understand the relationship between 
GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field based 
values at the two study area.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors used the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach. This method involves extracting one observation at a time from the dataset and estimating the model parameters using the remaining (n-1) observations. Afterward, the model is applied to the extracted observation. By employing this technique, the researchers aimed to minimize overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. However, it should be noted that while LOOCV can help assess the model's performance across different subsets of the data, it does not directly address issues related to diversity within the dataset itself. Therefore, additional steps might have been necessary to ensure that the dataset was diverse enough to capture various aspects of the problem domain accurately. Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit details about any specific measures taken to guarantee the diversity of the dataset.
