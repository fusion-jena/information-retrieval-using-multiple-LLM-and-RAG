train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

%Query
Query: "What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the given data that the mean prediction errors are calculated for various videos, which could indicate that this metric might have been used to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the use of few-shot learning suggests that the authors may have monitored the model's ability to generalize well even when trained on limited data. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategies were employed to monitor the model performance during training.
