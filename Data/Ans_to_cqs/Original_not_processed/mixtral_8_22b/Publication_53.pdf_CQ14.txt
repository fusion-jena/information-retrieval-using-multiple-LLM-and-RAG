Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Statistical Analyses

We used Python [35] and fastai [30] for developing the deep learning CNN. We used
R [36] for all statistical analyses, using packages sf [37] and raster [38] for data manipulation;
ggplot2 [39], rasterVis [40] and cowplot [41] for plotting. We also used R for designing
the website AusDams.org, using Shiny [42], Leaﬂet [43], Plotly [44] and using Joe Cheng’s
Superzip template (https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html).

3. Results
3.1. Reported Farm Dams

There were 1,694,675 farm dams reported by regional and Federal authorities in
Australia. The majority of farm dams were in New South Wales (37%), Victoria (26%),
Queensland (17%) and Western Australia (10%; Table S1). Around three-quarters of Aus-
tralia recorded at least one dam per 2000 km2, but the typical density near urban centres
was 2–5 farm dams per km2 (Figure 2). The average size of a dam was ca. 1000 m2, ranging
from 100 m2 to >105 m2 (Figure 3).

3.2. Data Veriﬁcation

Please refer to Table S1 for details on curator, spatial coverage, temporal coverage,
sample size, data type, ﬁlters, access date and source for all datasets used in this study.
Brieﬂy, we sourced data on 1,694,675 farm dams from (1) the Surface Water map by
Geoscience Australia (N = 934,381), (2) the Department of Environment, Land, Water &
Planning of the Victorian Government (N = 429,398), (3) the Department for Environment
and Water in South Australia (N = 105,361), (4) the Department of Primary Industries and
Regional Development in Western Australia (N = 162,785), (5) the Department of Primary
Industries, Parks, Water and Environment in Tasmania (N = 61,897) and (6) the Environment
& Planning Directorate in the Australian Capital Territory (N = 853). For large farm dams
(>105 m2 in surface area), we removed those that appeared of natural origins (i.e., complex
shapes, jiggered borders) by retaining only those with simple and regular shapes, calculated

of 0.8287. We used the trained model to automatise the classiﬁcation of 500 more images
from the unlabelled training dataset, and we manually ﬁxed any mistakes. We repeated
this process of training, classiﬁcation and checking until all of the 7362 downloaded images
were labelled.

Figure 7. The online guided user interface of AusDam.org. This example shows all dams (red dots) in the region near
Esperance in Western Australia. The panel on the left allows the user to choose the variables to represent as point colour
(e.g., the region of the map, data source) and as point size (e.g., surface area, perimeter, estimated water capacity) for each
dam. The histogram shows expected counts (dots), documented dams (blue bars), and the expected false positives (orange
bars), following all calculations presented in this study. The banner at the top summarises the overall statistics. The two
tabs at the top presents the raw data (Data explorer) and information about the project and the methods (About).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions the use of Python and fastai for developing the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but it does not specify whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
