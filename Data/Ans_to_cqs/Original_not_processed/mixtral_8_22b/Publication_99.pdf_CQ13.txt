applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model. 

3.4. Performance evaluation

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss.

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

different training procedures have been discussed. Each category of a

Helpful Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models vary depending on the type of network being used. Here are some examples:

For PConv networks, the input dimension is either 256x256 or 512x512, the batch size is 1, the learning rate is 2e-4, and the optimizer used is Adam. The loss functions include per-pixel loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and total variation loss. These networks are pre-trained on ImageNet and trained for 50 epochs.

For Pix2Pix networks, the input dimension can be either 256x256 or 512x512, the batch size is 1, the learning rate is 9e-5, and the optimizer used is also Adam. The loss functions include adversarial loss and L1 loss.

For classification networks, the input dimension can be either 256x256 or 512x512, the batch size is 32, the learning rate is 0.03, and the optimizer used is again Adam. The loss function used here is cross-entropy loss. These networks are trained from scratch for 20 epochs if they use a smaller image size (256x256), but if they use a larger image size (512x512), they are pre-trained on ImageNet.

All input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 while using ReLU activation for the encoder part and LeakyReLU activation for the decoder part of the network. All models were trained for 50 epochs.
