These  two  examples  of  small  sample  sizes  highlight  a  conflict  in 
preferred protocol. Ideally, (1) all species would be included in a clas-
sification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity, (2) 
all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to 
better represent the variability found in the area, and (3) only confident 
‘ground truth’ classifications would be considered in the training model. 
Unfortunately, in species where identity must be determined based on 
call characteristics (rather than visual confirmation of species identity in 
the field), it can sometimes be difficult to confidently determine species 
identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one 
call  that  provides  high  confidence  of  species  identity.  In  the  case  of 
beaked whales, we recommend that training data include a high level of 
confidence for inclusion. This is especially critical for species with small

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common practices used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by exposing it to different types of data during training. The use of these techniques depends on the specific application and available resources. For example, collecting a diverse dataset might require significant time and effort, while cross-validation and stratified splitting can be implemented relatively easily using existing libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. It is also important to note that no single technique guarantees perfect generalization, and often multiple approaches need to be combined to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, further research is needed to understand which combination of techniques works best for a given problem domain.
