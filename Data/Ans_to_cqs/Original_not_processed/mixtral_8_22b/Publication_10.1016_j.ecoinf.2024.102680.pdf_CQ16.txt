To validate the effectiveness of the UODN in detecting underwater 
objects,  we  trained  various  object  detection  algorithms  under  the 
MMDetection framework (Chen et al., 2019), including two-stage object 
detection  algorithms  (Faster  RCNN,  Cascade  RCNN  (Cai  and 

Vasconcelos, 2018), and Libra RCNN (Pang et al., 2019)), single-stage 
object  detection  algorithms  (fully  convolutional  one-stage  object 
detection (FCOS) (Tian et al., 2019), adaptive training sample selection 
(ATSS)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2020),  real-time  models  for  object  detection

The  first  row  is  the  baseline  model,  YOLOv8s.  Compared  to 
YOLOv8s, the CSMB and LKSP modules improved the performance of 
the baseline network. The CSMB module improved the AP50 by 1%, the 
AP75  by 1.6%, and the AP by 0.8%, indicating that the CSMB module 
effectively extracted features of underwater objects. The LKSP module 
also  achieved  outstanding  performance  in  terms  of  AP  values.  It 
perfectly replaced the SPPF module without significantly increasing the 
number  of  parameters,  achieving  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  than  the 
SPPF module. Although both modules increased the number of param-
eters,  UODN  still  had  fewer  parameters  than  YOLOv8m,  and  its  AP 
values  were  better  than  those  of  YOLOv8m.  The  parameters  of 
YOLOv8m increased by 14.7 million, but its AP increased by only 0.6%. 
The AP values of our LKSP module were similar to those of YOLOv8m, 
but the LKSP module increased the number of parameters by only 0.6

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from common machine learning practices that some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting a predefined threshold for a chosen metric such as accuracy or F1 score. In this case, since the text mentions validating the effectiveness of the Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN) using various object detection algorithms, it might imply that the training was considered complete once the desired performance metrics were met or surpassed. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact training process, it remains uncertain what precise criteria were employed to decide when the training should conclude.
