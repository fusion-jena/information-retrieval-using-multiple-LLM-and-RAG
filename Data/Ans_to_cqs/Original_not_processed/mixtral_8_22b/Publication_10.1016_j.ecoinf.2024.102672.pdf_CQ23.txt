The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new cate-
gorical binary variable that stored the existence of stratification or not 
(took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it 
was stratified).

Table 2 contains the best set of hyperparameters found for each set of 
variables,  together  with  the  results  from  the  training  on  the  whole 
training data set and test on unseen data. During the cross-validation 
process,  there  were  no  discrepancies  among  the  three  metrics  used. 
Generally, the best model for each set of variables was optimal regarding 
the three metrics or the differences were <1%. In case of these small 
discrepancies, the model with the highest AUC was chosen. The first row 
in Table 2, represented as t in the column of variables, contains the re-
sults of the model with only variables that are contemporaneous with 
the target. The row represented as + t-1 contains the variables in t and 
the 1-day lagged variables, and so on in the following rows. The number 
of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guar-
anteed the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross- 
validation.

Opposite to other families of ML models that have a narrow range of 
hyperparameters  to  adjust,  ANN  are  defined  by  different  types  of 
hyperparameters,  which  together  with  the  computational  cost  of 
training deep ANN, restricts the options to optimize. On the one hand, 
we have the hyperparameters that define the architecture of the ANN 
(number of layers and number of neurons), while on the other hand we 
have the hyperparameters that control de training process (mainly the 
learning rate, the optimizer, the batch size and the number of epochs 
that the training lasts). In order to avoid an exhaustive search that could 
consume a lot of time, a small dimensional space was initially defined 
and  explored  with  the  original variables.  The initial  hyperparameters 
that composed this space are shown in Table 1. The number of epochs 
was maintained in 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the

model the binary variable that stores the existence of stratification or not 
was defined as the target, while the independent variables mentioned in 
Section 2.2 were defined as the predictors. The variables were scaled 
before being passed to the model by removing the mean and scaling to 
unit variance in order to avoid the effect that the different scale of the 
variables could have on the results. 

The selection of the best set of hyperparameters was made according 
to three commonly used metrics: the binary accuracy, the recall calcu-
lated as in Eq. (4), where TP is the number of true positives and FN is the 
number  of  false  negatives,  and  the  area  under  the  ROC  (Receiver 
Operating Characteristics) curve (AUC).

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was diverse, containing both categorical binary variables and continuous variables. This diversity helped the model learn patterns across various data types. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the model development phase. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the original sample into subsets such that the analysis is initially performed on a single subset, while all other subsets are retained for subsequent use in validating the initial analysis. Lastly, the dataset was split using stratified sampling. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of the target variable remains consistent between the training and testing datasets. This helps prevent any bias towards certain classes in the final model. These measures collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model.
