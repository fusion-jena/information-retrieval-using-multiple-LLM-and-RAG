Our   work   highlights   the   importance   of   proper   metadata   curation   when   approaching   a
machine learning project. Assembling the training dataset for the mercury analysis required
many person   hours   to   visually   inspect   images   for   staining,   whereas   clubmoss   and
spikemoss images were easily compiled using specimen metadata alone. Nascent eﬀorts
in digitization in NHCs must carefully consider the acquisition and curation of metadata
because it aﬀects how quickly machine learning tools can be applied to digitized museum
collections.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search.

Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It could be possible that the authors did not use any specific optimization techniques like grid search or random search, but without further information, we cannot confirm this.
