dation,  requiring  the  development  of  more  robust  and  adaptive 
validation criteria and methods that can keep pace with the rapid ad-
vances in deep learning methods. For example, the spatial heterogeneity 
in  the  foothills  is  associated  with  variability  in  bare  soil  cover,  tree 
height  and  structural composition,  and  large  gradients  of  macro- and 
micro-topography. These topographic landscape features can drastically 
alter species composition and richness in the area (Lopatin et al., 2015, 
2016). All these spectral, structural, and topographic variabilities can 
limit the applicability of the models to new values outside the training 
samples. Thus, the ability of predictive models to generalize and accu-
rately  apply  insights  to  new  locations  beyond  the  original  dataset 
(training, validation, and test data) is crucial for the operational con-
sistency (Chadwick et al., 2024). This requirement highlights the critical

of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

The species Pinus radiata is highly invasive in native forests in Chile, drastically affecting the functioning and 
structure of ecosystems. Hence, it is imperative to develop robust approaches to detect P. radiata invasions at 
different scales. Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have proven to be a promising alternative 
to detect plant invasions in high-resolution remote sensing data, such as those obtained by drones. However, 
studies have been limited in their spatial variability and their assessments of transferability or transfer learning to 
new sectors, hindering the ability to use these models in a real-world setting. We train models based on CNN 
architectures  using  unpiloted  aerial  vehicle  data  and  evaluate  their  ability  to  transfer  learning  outside  the 
training domain using regression approaches. We compared models trained with low spatial variability (mono-

While  adopting  deep  learning  techniques  in  remote  sensing  has 
surged, providing novel solutions to complex problems and the devel-
opment of model validation frameworks has lagged, creating a gap in the 
reliability  of  these  advanced  models  (Filippelli  et  al.,  2024).  Deep 
learning models, including CNN architectures and traditional machine 
learning models, frequently underperform in predicting species presence 
or  coverage  in  previously  unconsidered  areas.  This  limitation,  often 
referred  to  as  the  model's  inability  to  generalize  or  transfer  learned 
patterns to new contexts (transfer learning), becomes particularly pro-
nounced in diverse landscapes characterized by significant variations in 
terrain  and  spectral properties  (Barela  et  al., 2021; Kattenborn et  al., 
2022;  Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  The  complex  nature  of  these  het-
erogeneous  environments  poses  significant  challenges  for  model  vali-

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, some relevant points can still be extracted from the given text.

Deep learning models, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are widely adopted in remote sensing applications but face challenges when applied to diverse landscapes with significant terrain and spectral property variations. One issue mentioned in the context is the difficulty in validating these models, especially regarding their ability to generalize or perform transfer learning in new contexts.

To improve the reliability of these advanced models, researchers need to focus on developing robust model validation frameworks. In this regard, the context mentions the importance of conducting large cross-validation (CV) experiments with deep learning-based models. However, it also notes that such experiments might be computationally expensive and could lead to reduced training heterogeneity.

Although the context does not explicitly discuss handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, one common strategy to manage the effect of random seeds is to fix them during experimentation. By fixing the random seed, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across multiple runs of the same model. Additionally, they can compare results between different models or configurations without being affected by random initialization differences.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it emphasizes the need for reliable model validation frameworks and suggests that fixing random seeds can contribute to achieving consistent and comparable results.
