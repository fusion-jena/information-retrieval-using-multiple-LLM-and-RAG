Recent quantitative studies with coral reefs have emphasized varying 
machine learning approaches to assess sites and regions that lack suffi-
cient monitoring data. Numerous studies have used machine learning for 
image analysis of coral reef components (Rubbens et al., 2023). These 
have been primarily applied to coral species identification (Ganesan and 
Santhanam, 2022; Marre et al., 2020; Mills et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2022; 
Villon et al., 2021), but also include reef community status (Gonzalez- 
Rivero et al., 2020; Marre et al., 2020; Schürholz and Chennu, 2023) and 
habitat mapping in support of coastal management (e.g., Barve et al., 
2023; Do and Tran, 2023; Da Silveira et al., 2021). Some studies have 
shown that multiple machine-learning networks may be more successful 
at reef image identification (Burns et al., 2022; Lumini et al., 2020; Sun 
et al., 2022). Rubbens et al. (2023) have reviewed applications of ma-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it mentions several studies that use machine learning techniques for various purposes related to coral reefs. For instance, Villon et al. (2021) developed automatic underwater fish species classification with limited data using few-shot learning. This suggests they might have used their own custom dataset for this purpose. Similarly, Do and Tran (2023) combined a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Again, no specific dataset is mentioned, implying they could have used their own collected data. Other studies like Burns et al. (2022) and Sun et al. (2022) discuss using multiple machine-learning networks for reef image identification, but do not specify which datasets were utilized. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact datasets employed in these deep learning pipelines.
