Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

rameters of data mining. The column “mixture or time” represents the combined pesticides as a mixture of compounds or the finding period.

statistics;  

• Mapping and interpretation of the results: It evaluates whether the 
objective has been achieved, and if the answer is no, it proceeds with 
the reiteration (and possible modification) of the previous step and 
sometimes further steps.  

• display of results in an understandable format;

• decisions making. 

2.2. Study area

in Fig. 2. 

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.
