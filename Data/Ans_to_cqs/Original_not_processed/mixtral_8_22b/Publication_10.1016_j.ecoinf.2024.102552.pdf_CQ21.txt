However, there are disadvantages to the manual delineation method 
we  used  for  classification,  largely  that  it  was  labor-intensive,  which 
impacted the quantity of imagery we could classify as well as our vali-
dation  methods.  Having  two  classifiers  working  together,  one  with 
knowledge of the imagery (M.V. Eitzel, MVE) and one with knowledge 
of the field sites (Daniel Sarna-Wojcicki, DSW), resulted in much more 
accurate  classifications  than  a  classifier  working  more  independently 
(Sean  Hogan,  SH)  –  but  this  method  took  a  large  number  of  person-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. This can be done by creating a confusion matrix, which is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Additionally, generating saliency maps can help understand how the model arrived at its predictions by highlighting important features in the input data. Other possible postprocessing steps may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, ensemble modeling, or deploying the model into production environments.
