siderations made earlier, a Bayesian Deep Learning model, if properly
configured and trained, can return satisfactory results even with limited
datasets, which is the scenario studied in the present work.

Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

Deep Neural Networks are architectures that present remarkable
advantages and can potentially map every possible function, but they
are often affected by many issues such as overfitting. The main draw-
back of standard Deep Learning is that Neural Networks compute single
values of their parameters and therefore they are incapable of correctly
assessing the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) or to
the model itself (epistemic uncertainty); in fact they often produce
overly confident decisions about the correct class, prediction or action to
take, even if the sample is very far from the training data we provided.
The purpose of Bayesian Neural Networks is to use probability theory
to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. The advantage
is clear in areas where decision making plays a fundamental role. To be
more specific, a Probabilistic Neural Network handles the aleatoric
uncertainty by placing a probability distribution (whose parameters can

The values of other metrics, namely MAE, SMAPE and NMPIW, are reported in this appendix. In particular, SMAPE and NMPIW are useful because,
unlike conventional metrics, they provide a measure of the quality of prediction intervals in relation to the variability of the observed data. For a good
model, desirable values for SMAPE are typically below 20%, indicating accurate and balanced predictions, while NMPIW values should be close to 0,
reflecting narrow prediction intervals compared with the observed data range. The analysis made for MSE is still considered valid.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the study focuses on scenarios with limited datasets, suggesting that the authors might have been working under resource constraints.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of Bayesian Deep Learning models, which inherently address some aspects of generalization due to their ability to handle uncertainties associated with the data and the model itself. This property could help improve the robustness and reliability of the model when dealing with new, unseen data.

Additionally, the performance evaluation includes various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Normalized Median Positive Interval Width (NMPIW). These metrics not only assess the accuracy of the model but also evaluate its capability to generate reliable prediction intervals, contributing to the overall confidence in the model's generalizability.
