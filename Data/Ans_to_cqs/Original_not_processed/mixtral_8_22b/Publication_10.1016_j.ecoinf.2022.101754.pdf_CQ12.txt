2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

Helpful Answer:
Based on the information provided, it appears that the study utilizes four methods to model forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB): AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). Among these, only one method can be classified as a deep learning model - the multilayer neural network (NET). However, the specific architecture or type of this neural network is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot determine if it is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of neural network.
