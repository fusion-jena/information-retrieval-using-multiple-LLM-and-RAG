1. Introduction 

Target variables are usually fully labeled in the classical supervised 
machine learning setting. In real-world predictive tasks, however, labels 
are often scarce and/or noisy. Various definitions and terms are used in 
the  literature  to  describe  variants  of  noise  and  scarceness  of  labels 
(Allison, 2001; Xie and Huang, 2018; Nikoloski et al., 2021; Sun et al., 
2010; Gao et al., 2017; Alarc´on and Destercke, 2021; Van Engelen and 
Hoos, 2020), and each setting requires tailored approaches for exploit-
ing such target labels. In this study, we formulate a new computational 
setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. We 
computationally study this task via a case study in predictive modeling 
of global vegetation cover. 

1.1. The vegetation modelling task

Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

A related research question in ecology and biogeography is how to 
predict the potential natural vegetation (PNV). PNV is the expected state 
of mature vegetation, given a particular set of environmental constraints 
in the absence of human intervention (Chiarucci et al., 2010). At first, 
PNV models were constructed based only on expert knowledge, whereas 
nowadays, various statistical techniques and machine learning methods 
are more widely employed (Hemsing and Bryn, 2012). In Hengl et al. 
(2018), authors evaluate different machine learning methods, such as 
neural  networks,  random  forests,  gradient  boosting,  and  k-nearest 
neighbours,  for  PNV  mapping  in  a  classification  setting.  The  latter 
example  describes  global  PNV  mapping.  However,  most  PNV  studies 
focus on specific areas or regions (Raja et al., 2019; Vaca et al., 2011; 
Hemsing and Bryn, 2012).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These steps typically involve preparing the input data so that it can be effectively processed by the neural network. Some common preprocessing steps include:

* Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so that they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others during training.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the values of input features so that they are all roughly on the same scale. This can help ensure that the neural network does not give too much weight to one feature over another.
* Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or redundant information from the input data. For example, if there are missing values in the dataset, they should be filled in or removed altogether. Similarly, outliers or extreme values should also be identified and handled appropriately.
* Feature engineering: Depending on the problem being solved, additional features may need to be created or extracted from the raw input data. For example, if working with image data, features like edges or corners might be useful for identifying objects within the images.

Overall, the goal of preprocessing is to prepare the input data in a way that makes it easier for the neural network to learn patterns and relationships within the data. By taking care to properly preprocess the input data, it is possible to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models.
