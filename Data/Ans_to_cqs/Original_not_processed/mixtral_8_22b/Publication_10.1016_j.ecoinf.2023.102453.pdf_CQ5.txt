Neural architecture search (NAS) was used for developing the Effi-
cientNetV2B0 model, and for the optimization of parameter efficiency 
and  training  speed  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  The  model  performance  was 
improved  using  progressive  learning  to  adapt  regularization  to  the 
image size (Tan and Le, 2021). EfficientNetV2 is a family of models (B0 
to B7), and B0 is the smallest variant in the family (Keras, n.d), with the 
other  models  progressively  increasing  in  performance  going  up  to 
EfficientNetV2B7.

The  transfer  learning  for  the  TensorFlow  models  used  the  three 
possibilities,  feature  extraction,  fine  tuning  with  some  layers  trained, 
and  fine  tuning  with  all  layers  trained.  The  results  have  shown  an 
improvement in the classification performance with all layers trained. 
However, it is important to note that with feature extraction most of the 
pre-trained learning is preserved and used on newer tasks. The feature 
extraction was also seen as achieving high accuracy especially for small 
datasets with a reduced training time (Simoes et al., 2023; Willi et al., 
2019).  A  performance  improvement  of  MobileNetV2  model  was  re-
ported  with  the  model  fine-tuning  (Cunha  et  al.,  2021).  Similarly, 
depending on how many layers are trained in fine tuning, this can affect 
the  model  performance,  with  fine  tuning  of  more  layers  resulting  in 
learning of more features from the new dataset. In comparison to other

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there are several datasets mentioned that were used in various deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Caltech Camera Trap Dataset: This dataset consists of 243,100 images. It has been used in conjunction with TensorFlow Lite InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception pre-trained on ImageNet neural network models.

2. Snapshot Serengeti: This dataset contains 78,000 images. It has been used with MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB3 models.

3. African Elephant (Loxodonta Africana) Dataset: Although not explicitly stated, this dataset appears to be part of the research conducted by Whytock et al. (2023) and Swie˙zewski et al. (2021).

4. Multiple Datasets: These unnamed datasets have been used in species distribution modeling, which involves understanding the relationship between species occurrence data and environmental data.

5. Passive Acoustic Monitoring: While not directly related to visual datasets like those above, passive acoustic monitoring involves analyzing audio recordings to identify different animal species. This method has been used with twelve pre-trained models.

It should be noted that these datasets vary significantly in their content and purpose. Some focus specifically on certain species or environments, while others cover broader categories. Additionally, each dataset may require specific preprocessing steps before being suitable for use in a deep learning pipeline.
