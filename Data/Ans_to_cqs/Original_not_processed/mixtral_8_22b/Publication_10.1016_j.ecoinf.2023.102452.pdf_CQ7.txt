specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning and data science that common methods include random splitting, stratified sampling, temporal splitting, or cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. These methods aim to ensure that the resulting subsets maintain similar statistical properties to the original dataset while also providing a robust way to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.

In the given context, there is no direct reference to any particular data splitting technique being applied. Therefore, based solely on the information available, one cannot definitively state which criteria were used to divide the data for deep learning model training.
