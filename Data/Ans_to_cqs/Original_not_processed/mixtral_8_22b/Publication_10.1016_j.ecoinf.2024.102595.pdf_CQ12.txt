In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

The research integrates machine learning and deep learning models 
to enhance the accuracy of the forecasts. The models used can be clus-
tered based on their approach, complexity, and underlying algorithms. 
In the machine learning category, ensemble models (AdaBoost Regres-
sor, Extra Trees Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regres-
sor, and Bagging Regressor), linear models (Bayesian Ridge Regressor, 
Elastic Net, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Stochastic Gradient 
Descent  Regressor),  nonlinear  models  (Support  Vector  Regressor  and 
Decision Tree Regressor), and gradient boosting models (XGBoost Re-
gressor,  LightGBM  Regressor,  Histogram-Based  Gradient  Boosting  Re-
gressor,  and  Gradient  Boosting  Regressor)  were  utilized.  The  deep 
learning  model  used  was  the  deep  neural  network  (Deep  Neural 
Network). These algorithms were chosen because they are known for 
their ability to handle complex data, produce accurate predictions, and

This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

Helpful Answer:

The article mentions that a deep learning model called Deep Neural Network (DNN) was used in the pipeline. However, it does not provide specific details about the architecture of the DNN, such as whether it uses convolutional layers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent connections like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or attention mechanisms like Transformers. Therefore, while we know that a DNN was used, we cannot determine its exact type without additional information.
