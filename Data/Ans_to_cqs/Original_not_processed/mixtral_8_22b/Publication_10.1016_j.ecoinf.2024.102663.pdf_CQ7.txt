1.  Draw a bootstrap sample of the dataset.  
2.  Grow  a  decision  tree  from  the  bootstrap  sample.  At  each  node:  a. 
Randomly  select  a  subset  of  features.  b.  Determine  the  best  split 
based on these features.  

3.  Repeat the process for each new node until a stopping criterion is 

met.  

4.  Aggregate predictions from all the trees for the final prediction.

Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The dataset was split into three parts: 70% for training, 10% for testing, and 20% for validation. This means that out of the entire dataset, 70% of it was used to train the deep learning models, while 10% was used to evaluate the performance of the trained models during the development phase. The remaining 20% was used to validate the models after they had been fully developed. These percentages can vary depending on the specific requirements of the project or the preferences of the researchers.
