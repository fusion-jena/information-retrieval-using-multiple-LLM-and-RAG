4.2. Ability of WUI to reflect wetland management practices 

Fig.  6  shows  density  plots  for  the  500  samples  per  wetland  man-
agement category as a representation of value distribution, their average 
values and standard deviations. Wetlands under full protection have the 
overall lowest values (mean = 141, std.dev. = 86). However, not the 
wetlands under conditional use (mean = 241, std.dev. = 140), but the 
wetlands  under  unrestricted  use  exhibit  the  next  higher  value  range 
(mean = 179, st.dev. = 83). They also have the widest value distribution 
and the highest standard deviation. The one-way ANOVA showed that 
there was a statistically significant difference in logarithmic WUI values

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate response based solely on this source.

However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. Additionally, researchers may choose to report results across multiple runs with different random seeds to demonstrate the robustness of their findings.
