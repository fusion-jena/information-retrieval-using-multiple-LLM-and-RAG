gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

also other bivalve species and other locations. This may go so far as even 
including  bivalves  in  offshore  environments.  Overall,  this  would 
improve bioenergetic models, where clearance and respiration terms are 
inherently  linked  with  gaping.  The  current  formulations  of  models 
however do not account for linkages with food, aside from considering a 
half saturation constant, nor the different degrees of daily oscillations. 
Further  experimentation,  under  constrained  lab  conditions,  linking 
gaping activity with actual clearance rate and respiration rates under 
different  settings  will  also  help  devising  indices  that  could  be  then 
extrapolated to use gaping directly in the models. An indication of en-
ergy consumption during valve movement would also be useful to infer 
the  consequences of  having  a more or less  pronounced  amplitudes of 
gaping, to better formulate this term in energetic based growth models.

4.1. Conclusions and outlook 

Given the causal relationship between valve gape and pumping rate, 
which  exists  both  for  actively  and  passively  controlled  gaping  angle

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce overfitting by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and reducing model complexity. Other regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. It is important to note that the choice of regularization method depends on various factors such as the size and nature of the dataset, the architecture of the neural network, and the desired trade-off between bias and variance.

Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that there is no mention of any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query regarding the specific regularization methods used. However, some commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. These methods can help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model parameters, reducing model complexity, and improving generalization performance.
