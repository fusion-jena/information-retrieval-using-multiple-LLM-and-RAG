hyperparameters  in  a  model.  It  identifies  the  most  effective  set  of 
hyperparameters  that  enhance  the  model's  performance.  During 
training,  GSCV  generates  a  series  of  models,  each  characterized  by  a 
different  set  of  hyperparameters.  The  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
systematically train and assess the performance of these various models 
through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the 
model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by 
its optimal hyperparameter combination (Adnan et al., 2022). Details of 
the primary tuning parameters, their range and the optimal combination 
of  hyperparameters  utilized  for  each  algorithm  for  each  model  are 
shown in Table 1.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study involves remote sensing data, which often includes satellite imagery. Additionally, there is reference to texture parameters, suggesting that images might be one of the data formats used. Furthermore, the use of neural networks and stochastic gradient boosting algorithms also implies the potential involvement of numerical datasets, such as those stored in CSV format. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data formats employed in the study.
