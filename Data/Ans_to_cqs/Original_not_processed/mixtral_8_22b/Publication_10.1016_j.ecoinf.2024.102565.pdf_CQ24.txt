During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

Generally, the principal aim of this study is to introduce an innova-
tive machine learning model designed to predict lake TSM concentration 
exclusively using wind speed, focusing on the Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs 
(CNRs)  in  Sistan,  Iran.  The  research  adopts  a  dual-focused  strategy: 
firstly, an in-depth analysis of the correlation between TSM concentra-
tion  and  wind  speed,  utilizing  both  satellite-derived  TSM  and  on-site 
wind  speed  data  to  formulate  a  model  for  TSM  retrieval  based  on 
wind  speed;  secondly,  an  exploration  of  temporal  transferability  by 
introducing an unprecedented machine learning model customized for 
TSM  estimation,  relying  solely  on  wind  speed.  To  accomplish  these 
objectives, wind speed data collected from CNRs and TSM concentration 
derived  from  a  time  series  of  satellite  imagery  were  seamlessly  inte-
grated to train a refined model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions that during the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K-fold cross-validation technique was used. Cross-validation helps reduce overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will generalize to new data. Furthermore, a four-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset, where each fold served as the validation set, while the remaining three folds formed the training set for model training. This approach can help manage some aspects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the text discusses addressing imbalances in the dataset using random under-sampling (RUS) applied to the training set. Random undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the classes. While this method doesn't directly address randomness related to the deep learning pipeline, it contributes to improving the overall performance of the model by reducing bias towards the majority class.
