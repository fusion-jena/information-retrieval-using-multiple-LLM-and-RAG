Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from some of the sources mentioned that they use various types of datasets such as nighttime light images, vegetation continuous field products, and spatial distribution of population data. These datasets could be in different formats like raster or vector data, which are commonly used in geospatial analysis. Additionally, some studies have used satellite imagery data, which could be in image format. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively determined what exact data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
