4. Results 

4.1. Model performance 

The model achieved F1 scores above 0.991 on all the training and 
0.934 on all validation data (Table 2). For the testing data, it generalised 
exceptionally  well  over  time  at  all  locations  (“test-over_time”)  with 
scores above 0.934. Moreover, a nearly perfect F1 score was also ob-
tained  at  locations  it  had  never  seen  before  (“test-over_location”) 
reaching F1 scores of 0.985, 1, and 1 (see an example in Fig. 5). In Table 
S2, we report the F1 scores as well as the number of actual nests, TP, FP 
and FN for each individual orthomosaic. Notably, the three orthomo-
saics  in  test-over_location  contained  48  nests.  The  model  correctly

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors used diverse datasets and performed various tests such as 'test-over\_time' and 'test-over\_location'. They reported achieving exceptional results with F1 scores above 0.934 on both training and validation data. Furthermore, they tested the model on unseen locations ('test-over\_location') where it obtained near-perfect F1 scores of 0.985, 1, and 1. This suggests that the model can accurately identify nesting sites even when applied to new geographical areas. Additionally, the model demonstrated strong temporal consistency by maintaining high performance levels across different time periods ('test-over\_time'). These findings indicate that the model has been successfully trained to handle variations in both space and time, thereby enhancing its overall robustness and applicability.
