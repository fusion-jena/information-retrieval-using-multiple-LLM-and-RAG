The duration of audio ﬁles in CLO-43DS data is different,
which cannot be directly used as the input to the CNN. The
ﬁrst method for dealing with the multi-variate varying length
audio data is that the signal is repeated from the beginning to
force the ﬁxed duration of 2s, which has been used in [30].
The second method is to directly resize the audio image to a
ﬁxed size.

D. DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE
The feature learning part of our proposed model follows a
VGG style network [24], which has been previously used
for classifying acoustic scenes [5]. The overall architec-
ture is illustrated in Table 1. This network is trained using
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10−4. The cate-
gorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The
batch size is 64 samples and the network is trained with
200 epochs.

trogram. In addition to different TFRs, a different deep learning architecture, SubSpectralNet, is employed
to classify bird sounds. Experimental results on classifying 43 bird species show that fusing selected deep
learning models can effectively increase the classiﬁcation performance. Our best fused model can achieve a
balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%.

To further improve the classiﬁcation performance, we not
only fuse CNN-based models with different input features,
but also fuse another CNN-based model with a different
architecture (see Table 2). The best classiﬁcation F1-score
can be up to 93.31%. Different from the VGG style network,
the SubSpectralNet can be regarded as a ﬁlter with different

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that the network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4. Therefore, the optimization technique applied in this deep learning pipeline is Adam.

Additional Information:
Adam (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a popular optimization algorithm used in training neural networks. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely RMSProp and AdaGrad. Adam computes adaptive learning rates for different parameters by maintaining a moving average of past gradients and squared gradients. This makes it well suited for problems with large datasets and high dimensionality.
