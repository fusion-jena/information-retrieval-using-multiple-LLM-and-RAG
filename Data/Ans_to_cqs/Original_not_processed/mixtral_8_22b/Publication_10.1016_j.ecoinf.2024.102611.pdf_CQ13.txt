leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

Table  3  gives  insights  into  the  distribution  of  trained,  tested,  and 
validated samples across  the groups. The data suggest that consistent 
ratios across groups are maintained in the sampling process to avoid any 
potential bias during classification. Different samples are present across 
groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. For 
evaluation,  both  validation  and  test  sets  are  considered  separately  to 
fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and 
scalability towards unseen datasets. 

4.5. Classifier specifications 

The Random Forest (RF) classifier is used in both levels of the hier-
archical classification model for performing group and plant-level pre-
dictions. Let several estimators N and Fi(x) be the function of predicting

the ith  decision tree for the input X, then the prediction 
C by RF is given

2.2. Classification using deep learning models 

Plant  leaf  recognition  has  been  carried  out  using  deep  learning 
models for adaptability to handle many species or classes. Some of the 
investigations in these directions are as discussed.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that a hyperparameter tuning technique was employed along with a batch updated stochastic gradient descent method [1]. This suggests that the learning rate might have been one of the adjusted parameters since it plays a crucial role in stochastic gradient descent optimization. Additionally, the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like ESPCA implies that some form of regularization could have been applied to prevent overfitting [2]. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the model configuration, we cannot provide a definitive list of all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
