percentage  higher  than  that  of  the  original  model,  and  the  overall 
improvement rate was 3.3%. This further indicated that introducing the 
human transmissibility index can improve the prediction accuracy of the 
model.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a diverse dataset was used for training and testing the model. Additionally, the use of logistic regression analysis suggests that some form of validation or cross-validation may have been employed during the development process. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed whether stratified splitting was also utilized.
