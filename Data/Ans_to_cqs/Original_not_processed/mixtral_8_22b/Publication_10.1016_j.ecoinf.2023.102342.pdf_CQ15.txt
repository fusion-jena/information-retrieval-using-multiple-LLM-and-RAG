Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

The Apriori algorithm consists of a sequence of steps for identifying 
the most frequent itemset in a given database (Fig. 2). Two main pro-
cesses  are  performed  iteratively  to  locate  the  most  frequent  itemsets: 
joining and pruning. As the name indicates, join represents the union of 
itemsets,  and  pruning  is  a  data  compression  technique  in  machine 
learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by 
removing  sections  of  the  tree  that  are  non-critical  and  redundant  to 
classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier 
and  improves  the  predictive  accuracy  by  reducing  overfitting  (Zhao 
et al., 2009).

in Fig. 2. 

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc. However, the text mentions the use of the Apriori algorithm, which is a classic algorithm used in data mining for finding frequent item sets and association rules. It doesn't directly relate to optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.

Moreover, the context discusses the concept of 'pruning', which is a data compression technique used in machine learning and search algorithms to reduce the size of decision trees by removing non-critical and redundant parts of the tree. While this could be considered a form of optimization, it is not one of the commonly referred optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer regarding what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
