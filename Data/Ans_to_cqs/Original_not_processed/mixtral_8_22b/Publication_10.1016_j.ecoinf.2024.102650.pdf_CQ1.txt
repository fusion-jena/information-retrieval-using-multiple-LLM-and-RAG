processing instructions can be found in Text S1. The final available data 
elements totaled 6802.

Tweets are usually short texts with such characteristics as sparsity, 
real-time nature, and irregularity. These features increase the difficulty 
of text processing (Edwards et al., 2022; Garg and Kumar, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2021) and require data cleaning to support subsequent analyses. 
Data cleaning includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. The 
former was used to filter out unnecessary symbols and noise, such as 
notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, stop words, 
and repeated texts on websites. User-generated text that deviated from 
the  theme  was  also  filtered  out  through  a  manual  review.  The  latter 
involved dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into 
meaningful  words,  which  is  a  key  technology  in  text  analyses  (Tian 
et al., 2021). We used Python’s Jieba Library for Chinese text segmen-
tation and a lexical analysis and included location, time, and organiza-
tional nouns.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that tweets were used as part of the dataset, suggesting that social media platforms may have been one source of data collection. Additionally, the context mentions that the final available data elements totaled 6802, but it does not specify how this data was collected or what types of data were included beyond tweets. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
