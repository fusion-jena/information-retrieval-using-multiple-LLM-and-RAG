mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

The data of a certain year are used as the test set, and the remaining data are the training and
validation set. The training and validation set ia divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation
method, in which nine of the parts are used as a training set and one is used for the validation set.
The percentage of the training, validation, and testing sets is 5.4:0.6:1. The training set is the data
sample used for model ﬁtting. The validation set is a set of samples set aside separately during the
model training. It can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and to conduct a preliminary
evaluation of the model’s capabilities. The testing set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of
the ﬁnal model. However, it cannot be used as a basis for algorithm-related selection such as parameter
tuning and selection of features. The mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of

Traditional means and algorithms lack the ability to quantitatively analyze the drivers and
mechanisms of LUCC, and the accumulation of massive data over the years provides the possibility of
using deep learning models for related explorations. The probability of the LU distribution can be
determined by a deep learning model. The LU probability cannot determine whether a certain LU
type exists at that time; its function is to determine the distribution probability of a variety of LU types
in a spatial unit, and the probability is the basis for the SM.

Figure 4 introduces the adopted DM. In the DM, the grid with the neighborhood features includes
the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, and all grid
units are input into the DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, ﬁt the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the
SM, and perform further LU simulations.

Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 22  2.3.3. Deep Learning Model Models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), i.e., deep learning-based models, are gaining attention in the remote sensing domain [30–34]. The neural networks are used to fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC. The drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC greatly influence the LUCC trajectories, play a dominant role in the study of the LUCC mechanism, and are the forces that cause changes in the LU patterns. Currently, the drivers of LUCC often include natural, socioeconomic, and political factors. The current consensus is that natural conditions control the basic trends and processes of the overall LUCC and the changes in the natural environment, such as climate change, and change the spatial distribution pattern of LU to a great extent. Human activities and socioeconomic factors are the main drivers of LUCC on a small spatiotemporal scale. LUCC is mainly driven by socioeconomic factors over short

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any specific mention of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context suggests that the dataset used consists of grids containing various features such as land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. These features were collected from six different years - 1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013. Additionally, the dataset was split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets, with a ratio of approximately 5.4:0.6:1 respectively. The training and validation sets were further divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation method.
