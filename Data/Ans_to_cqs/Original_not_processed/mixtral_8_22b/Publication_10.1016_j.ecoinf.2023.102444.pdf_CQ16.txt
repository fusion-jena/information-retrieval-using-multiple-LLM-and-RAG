is presented in Fig. 8A for the UMAP model and in Fig. 8B for the MaxEnt 
model and shows a departure from the random prediction in both cases. 
Finally, the mutual information coefficient (Fig. 9) shows the relative 
importance of the bioclimatic variables as related to latent distance. For 
A. cephalotes, BIO01, BIO04, and BIO12 share more information and are 
more clearly related to distance. In the case of the MaxEnt model, the 
highest contributions were made by BIO04 (45.7%), BIO12 (42.6%), and

Once  the  UMAP  model  was  constructed,  the  testing  data  was 
embedded  into  the  model  for  projection  in  the  latent  space.  For  the 
training  and  test  data,  we  computed  the  nearest  neighbor  Euclidean 
distance  between  species-species  (Dss)  and  background-species  (Dsb). 
We then calculated Pss, the cumulative empirical distribution function 
of the intra-species distance Dss. Calculation of Pss was according to the 
following equation (R Core Team, 2022): 

Pssn(D) =

(
1
n

)∑n

i=1

1[di≤D]

where the step function Pss is the proportion of observations less than or 
equal to a given distance D, n is the number of distance measures, and di 
is the distance value. Once the Pss function was determined, we calcu-
lated S = (1- Pss) for the distances between the background and species

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for either the UMAP or MaxEnt models. However, it can be inferred that some form of performance evaluation must have been conducted on the training and testing datasets to assess the accuracy of these models. Commonly used criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum threshold for validation loss, achieving a maximum level of accuracy, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several iterations. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which, if any, of these criteria were applied during the training process for the UMAP and MaxEnt models.
