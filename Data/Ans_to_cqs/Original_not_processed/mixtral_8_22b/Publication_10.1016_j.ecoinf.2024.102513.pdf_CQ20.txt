Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.7. Training configuration 

The calculations were performed on an ASUS laptop with an Intel i7- 
11370H CPU (4 cores, 3.30 GHz), 16 GB DDR4 memory, and an NVIDIA 
GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card (4 GB). The dataset for each period was 
divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, 
respectively. 

2.8. Classification accuracy 

The accuracy calculation was performed for each model trained on 
the corresponding period and was computed using the sklearn library for

Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

of deep learning, a neural network was meticulously trained using these 
datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures.
