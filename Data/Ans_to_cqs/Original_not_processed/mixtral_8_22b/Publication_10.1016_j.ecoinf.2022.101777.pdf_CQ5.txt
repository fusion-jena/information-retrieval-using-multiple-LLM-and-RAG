racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

tion, the 20 m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10 m in order to 
harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was 
adjusted to this resolution.

Images were then classified out via Random Forest (RF). This is a 
specific  machine  learning  technique  based  on  the  iterative,  random 
creation  of  decision  trees.  First,  the  input  features  and  classes  were 
defined. RF calculates several random decision trees based on (1) the 
number of training samples and (2) the number of trees. The more trees 
there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation 
time is. RF creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coef-
ficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created 
and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the 
majority vote of the decision trees. The number of training samples was 
5000 and the number of trees was 500.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study involves image classification using Random Forest, a popular machine learning algorithm. It also states that the images were resampled to harmonize all band data and adjust the classification to a 10m resolution. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the source or type of images, I cannot determine which specific dataset was used in their deep learning pipeline. Commonly used datasets for image classification tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others.
