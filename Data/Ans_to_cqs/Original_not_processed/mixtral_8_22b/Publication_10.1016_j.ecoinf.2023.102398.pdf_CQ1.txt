In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

The  global  average  pooling  is  used  in  the  squeeze  step  to  lower  the 
spatial  dimension  of  the  input  feature  maps,  which  results  in  a  com-
pressed  representation of those maps. Once again, during the  time of 
excitation, channel-wise dependencies are represented by modelling the 
interdependencies  among the  compressed feature maps  that were ob-
tained from the squeezing step. The term “excitation layer” refers to the 
two layers that are completely coupled to one another. The channel-wise 
attention  weights  are  produced  once  the  excitation  block  has  been 
processed. When everything is done, scaling and rescaling are accom-
plished by multiplying the attention weight by the initial feature maps. 
This reduces the weight of the channels that are not important while 
increasing the weight of the channels that are significant. As a result of 
this,  the  model’s  performance  can  be  improved  by  increasing  the

nism with sizes are shown.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, implying that some form of data collection was performed. Additionally, the table shows that the model was tested using four different datasets, but it doesn't specify where or how these datasets were collected. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
