3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

In line with the requirements highlighted by Kinkade and Shepherd 
(2021), several tools have been developed based on a series of metrics 
that can be used to assess the compliance of a dataset with FAIR prin-
ciples. These tools pursue the same objective of evaluating the degree of 
FAIRness of a dataset but employ different methodologies. In general, 
these tools can be divided into three groups as automatic, manual, and 
hybrid  tools  (Peters-Von  Gehlen  et  al.,  2022;  Sun  et  al.,  2022).  Ac-
cording to Peters-Von Gehlen et al. (2022), none of the three models are 
perfect;  however,  each  offers  certain  advantages.  Manual  approxima-
tions  capture  contextual  approximations  that  are  more  subjective, 
whereas automatic approximations are stricter in terms of the aspects of 
the  analysis  conducted  by  the  machine.  More  difficulties  are  encoun-
tered in the context of automatic evaluation, and the search for alter-

Fig. 1 shows an extract from a JSON file that includes the identifier 
number, metric name with results (output), evaluation score, debugging 
messages, and a  summary of  all metrics in  the evaluation. Finally, to 
visualize the scores after compiling all the PIDs, we created a report by 
running a computational notebook (. ipynb document) provided by the 
FAIRsFAIR team (Devaraju and Huber, 2021a). This notebook provides 
an overall analysis and visualisation of all PID responses assessed using 
the F-UJI. 

In summary, a) the report reads JSON’s responses, b) collects all the 
total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame, and c) visualises the 
metrics  and  summarises  the  evaluations  (in  our  case,  the  datasets 
associated with each repository). The characteristics of the report are 
discussed in the Section 3. 

For further analysis, two aspects of the findings of this study were 

considered.

6. Conclusions 

addressing  data  quality.  For  this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  continue 
developing metrics such as the one proposed by F-UJI and methodolo-
gies  such  as  the  one  proposed  in  this  study  that  favour  not  only  the 
availability of data but also that they are really useful to use, share, and 
reuse. 

Regarding F-UJI, as mentioned by its creators, it is a continuously 
developing tool. Automatic testing of research data objects is based on 
the FAIR ecosystem, and its success depends on automatic testing with 
clear criteria that can be evaluated using machines.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a specific answer regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can discuss some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

One approach is to use diverse datasets during training. A diverse dataset should include various examples representing different scenarios or conditions that the model might encounter when deployed. By exposing the model to a wide range of situations, it becomes better equipped to handle new, unseen data.

Cross-validation is another technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and enhance its generalization capabilities. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets called folds. Each fold serves as a validation set once while the remaining folds form the training set. This process is repeated until every fold has served as the validation set. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

Stratified splitting is a strategy used to maintain class distribution when partitioning the dataset into training and test sets. Instead of randomly assigning instances to either set, stratification ensures that both sets contain roughly the same proportion of samples from each class. This approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers others.

Again, without additional details about the specific deep learning model being discussed, these techniques serve as potential ways to improve the generalizability of any given model.
