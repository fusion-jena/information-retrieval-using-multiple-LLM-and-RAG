Pourghasemi, 2021), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models (F. 
Huang et al., 2022; Y. Huang and Zhao, 2018; Shahzad et al., 2022; Xing 
et al., 2021). These models are flexible and adaptable systems that can 
manage diverse types of data and scenarios for LSM. Another type of 
MLM that has been explored for LSM is the Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), especially in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) (W. Chen et al., 
2018; Ngo et al., 2021) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configuration 
(Adnan  et  al.,  2020;  Chang  et  al.,  2022;  Z.  Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  These 
models can learn from data and adjust their parameters to improve their 
performance.

2.2.6. Heterogenous ensemble techniques 

Heterogeneous ensemble learning is the practice of combining pre-
dictions of multiple models that are different in terms of their underlying 
algorithms  or  architectures  to  improve  overall  performance.  Utilizing 
heterogeneous ensemble techniques can address biases and improve the 
implemented  two 
effectiveness  of  models. 

In  our  study,  we

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed using AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform.
