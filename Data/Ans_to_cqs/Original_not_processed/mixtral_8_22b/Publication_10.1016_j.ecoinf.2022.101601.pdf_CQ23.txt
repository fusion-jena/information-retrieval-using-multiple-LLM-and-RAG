most influential; conditional probabilities can also be learned from al-
gorithms,  such  as  the  Lauritzen  –  Spiegelhalter  algorithm  or  Gibbs 
sampling  (Chen  and  Pollino,  2012).  Finally,  the  inclusion  of  decision 
nodes can limit the tools and algorithms available for use in the GeNIe 
software  program.  The  inclusion  of  decision  nodes  results  in  the  BN 
being classified as an “influence diagram,” and some tools, such as the 
“sensitivity  analysis”  tool,  are  unavailable  for  use  with  influence  dia-
grams within the software. The decision nodes would either need to be 
removed or converted to chance nodes prior to running these tools in 
GeNIe.

%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its development process. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, there are several methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models, including using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, regularization techniques, early stopping, and transfer learning. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the ability of the model to perform well on new data. Without more information about the specific deep learning model being referred to, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
