2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

To  expand  this  approach  to  the  broader  community,  we  have 
identified three important challenges for future research. First, future 
developments  should  account  for  the  large  variability  in  the  size  of 
target  calls  (i.e.  templates).  Introducing  recurrent  connections  in  the 
CNN, or other architecture modifications could potentially reduce the 
negative  effects  of  window  size.  Second,  previous  studies  have  found 
data  augmentation  to  significantly  improve  performance  (Kahl  et  al., 
2019).  In  these  cases,  training  data  was  mainly  based  on  monodirec-
tional  recordings  of  single  species,  and  data  augmentation  (i.e.  noise 
addition)  apparently  helped  to  emulate  the  conditions  of  soundscape 
recordings.  The  effect  may  be  reduced  for  training  data  collected  di-
rectly from soundscapes, as in this study. Still, data augmentation may

be  necessary  to  increase  the  training  data  size  for  rare  species.  Thus, 
future  efforts  should  investigate  optimal  data  augmentation  methods 
for  bioacoustic  recognition.  Third,  an  important  challenge  will  be  to 
maintain  high  accuracy  while  increasing  the  efficiency  of  prediction. 
This  will  require  increasing  the  prediction  speed  and  decreasing  the 
memory  footprint  of  the  model by  investigating  other  network archi-
tectures and reducing the number of parameters.

1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). Although ImageNet does not contain 
spectrograms,  models  pre-trained  with  the  dataset  learn  a  variety  of 
image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram clas-
sification  previously  (Lasseck,  2019;  Florentin  et  al.,  2020).  While 
previous  studies  have  found  optimal  performance  using  ensembles  of 
multiple CNN models (Kahl et al., 2017; Lasseck, 2019; Florentin et al., 
2020), in the interest of prediction efficiency and reasonable memory 
requirements, we chose to evaluate a single ResNet50 model.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant points can still be discussed.

Firstly, the authors acknowledge the need for equal-sized input images for their chosen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. They opt for a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds, which is close to the average duration of target call types. This decision might help mitigate potential biases related to varying durations of different call types.

Secondly, they discuss the possibility of introducing recurrent connections into the CNN or making other architectural modifications to accommodate the large variability in the size of target calls. These adjustments could potentially minimize negative impacts caused by fixed window sizes.

Thirdly, the authors touch upon the use of data augmentation, specifically noise addition, to enhance performance. Data augmentation has proven beneficial in previous studies where training data primarily consisted of unidirectional recordings of individual species. It helps simulate real-world soundscape recording conditions. However, its effectiveness might diminish when dealing directly with soundscape recordings, like in this study. Nevertheless, data augmentation remains crucial for expanding the training data size for infrequent species.

Lastly, the text mentions the utilization of transfer learning via models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Despite ImageNet containing no spectrograms, models trained on it acquire various image features applicable to spectrogram classification. Previous works have demonstrated successful adaptation of these models for spectrogram classification tasks.

However, none of these strategies explicitly addresses data bias through techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a more detailed response regarding the application of these specific techniques in the described scenario.
