INTRODUCTION 

science,

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

classification  purpose.  Using  the  reshape 
method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer 
becomes (196,512). After analyzing the time 
features,  the  model  sorts  the  plant  species 
images  through  a  fully  connected  layer  to
