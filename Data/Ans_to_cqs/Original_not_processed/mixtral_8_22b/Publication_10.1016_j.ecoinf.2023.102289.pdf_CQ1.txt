Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference various sources such as Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) and the Places Database, which suggests that publicly available datasets could potentially be used as input for the deep learning process. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Google Street View images, indicating that web scraping or similar techniques might also be employed. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are being used for gathering raw data.
