2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

each layer is a neuron that operates on non-linear activation function, 
such as  sigmoid. These  neurons are  organised in such a way that the 
networks are directed only from lower to upper layers, and the neurons 
within  the  same  layer  are  independent.  Input  data  is  provided  to  the 
input node, processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, 
and  the  output  layer  provides  the  pattern  classification.  The  Markov

Helpful Answer:
The table does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors have utilized raster and supplementary data for their study. Specifically, they acquired three sets of data from USGS Earth Explorer, but the exact nature of these datasets remains unknown without further context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Based on the second piece of context, we can see that the authors employed the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network with Markov Chain (MLPnn-MC) modeling technique for their research. This approach combines the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain to simulate land use and land cover changes. While this information doesn't directly address the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that the authors may have applied this technique to analyze spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes using remote sensing imagery and other relevant datasets.
