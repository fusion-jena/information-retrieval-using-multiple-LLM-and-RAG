%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or explanation of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on research papers related to remote sensing, vegetation indexes, and machine learning algorithms for estimating chlorophyll content and crop coverage. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
