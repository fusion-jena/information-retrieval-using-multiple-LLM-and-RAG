dataset.  A  detailed  description  of  the  CNN  network  is  provided  in 
Table 1. The network has proven to have the same accuracy performance 
as more complex and deeper networks but with a shallow training time, 
as shown in the next section.

3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

retrieval measurements. 

To  sum  up,  SeedNet  seems  robust  for  both  tasks,  reaching 
outstanding performance results with both datasets and having a low 
training time if compared to the  other examined networks. However, 
other CNNs obtained satisfactory results, like the Residual Networks (e. 
g. ResNet18) in both tasks, or SqueezeNet in the retrieval one. The CNNs 
are also generally preferable in performances with respect to the tradi-
tional  methods,  even  though  the  last  ones  reached  interesting  results 
with low training times.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline were not explicitly mentioned. However, there are references to two different datasets: one referred to as the 'Canadian' dataset and another unnamed dataset referred to as the 'local' dataset. These datasets seem to be related to the task of single seed classification and retrieval. Unfortunately, without further context or details about these datasets, I cannot provide their exact names or sources.
