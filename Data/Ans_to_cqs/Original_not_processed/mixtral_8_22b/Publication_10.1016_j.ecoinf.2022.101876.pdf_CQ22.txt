Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The table provides a summary of performance metrics used to evaluate the Microsoft AI for Earth MegaDetector for detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska. These include True Positive Rate (TPR), False Discovery Rate (FDR), False Omission Rate (FOR), Accuracy (ACC), Error Rate (ERR), F1 Score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). TPR is also known as Recall and measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the detector. FDR calculates the ratio of false positive detections to total positive detections. FOR represents the fraction of false negatives among all negative predictions. ACC indicates the percentage of correct classifications out of the total number of cases examined. ERR is the complement of ACC, representing the percentage of incorrect classifications. The F1 score is the harmonic mean between TPR and Precision (PPV), providing a single metric that balances both properties. Lastly, MCC is a correlation coefficient between observed and predicted binary classifications, which returns a value between -1 and +1, where +1 represents perfect prediction, -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation, and 0 means no better than random prediction.
