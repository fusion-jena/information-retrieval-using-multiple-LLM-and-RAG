Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiÔ¨Åc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Helpful Answer:
After reviewing the given context, it appears that specific details about certain hyperparameters such as the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, some information regarding the architecture and other aspects of the model can still be found.

In this case, the deep learning model was developed using TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning. During the development process, several hyperparameters needed to be tuned before training the model. Through iterative grid search parameter tuning, it was determined that the model would use five hidden layers (Hj, j = 1, 2,..., 5), although the exact number of neurons (n) in each layer is not specified.

Additionally, the training process involved exposing all the training data to the network for a number of iterations until the loss function reached its minimum value. This occurred after approximately 5000 iterations using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The total number of trainable parameters was 85,569, and the computational runtime was around four hours with a training batch size of 1024.

While these details provide valuable insights into the structure and training process of the deep learning model, they do not directly address the requested hyperparameters like the learning rate and optimizer. It seems that further information would be required to fully answer the query.
