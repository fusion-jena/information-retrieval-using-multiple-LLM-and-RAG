Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation.

2.4. Performance metrics 

The  performance  of  image  classification  models  can  be  evaluated 
using several metrics which can provide valuable insights about their 
effectiveness.  The  choice  of  metrics  depends  on  the  specific  re-
quirements and characteristics of the task. In our study, we have chosen 
the  following  commonly  used  metrics  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the 
deep learning models: 

• Accuracy: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classi-
fied images out of the total number of images. The metric provides a 
general overview of model performance. 

Accuracy=

TruePositives+TrueNegatives
TruePositives+True Negatives+FalsePositives+FalseNegatives

.

In these metrics, true positives are correct positive predictions, true 
negatives  are  correct  negative  predictions,  false  positives  are  incorrect 
positive  predictions,  and  false  negatives  are 
incorrect  negative 
predictions.

2.3. Deep learning models 

The  selection  of  the  deep  learning  models  for  image  classification 
depends  on  available  computational  resources  and  the  trade-offs  be-
tween the model complexity and performance (Druzhkov and Kustikova, 
2016;  Li  et  al.,  2018).  To  test  the  performance  of  our  technique,  we 
selected  the  following  deep  learning  models:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and 
Zisserman, 2014), VGG19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), ResNet-50 
(He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-V3  (Szegedy  et  al.,  2016),  InceptionRes-
NetV2  (Szegedy et  al., 2017), Xception  (Chollet,  2017), DenseNet121 
(Huang et al., 2017), DenseNet169 (Huang et al., 2017), DenseNet201 
(Huang et al., 2017) and MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018). For the 
sake  of  brevity,  we  briefly  summarise  the  main  attributes  of  these 
techniques.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the paper discusses image classification models and mentions techniques such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, etc., it can be inferred that the data format used in this case is likely to be images. These models are popularly known for their use in computer vision tasks involving image recognition and classification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is most probably images.
