This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

The  most  time-consuming  step  after  data  gathering  is 
annotation.  Annotation  of  images  means  manual  labelling  of 
data by assigning some keywords/labels on the required areas in 
the  image  to  assign  metadata.  For  annotating  the  dataset,  the 
broders of objects were outlined to associate every single pixel 
of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label. There 
are various tools available in the market to annotate the images, 
but  this  research  used  Computer  Vision  Annotation  Tool 
(CVAT) [21] which is developed by Intel for labelling of data. 
The annotation data was then converted into COCO 1.0 dataset 
which was formatted in JSON and it is a collection of object id, 
image id, category id, segmentation, area, bbox, attributes, etc. 
The illustration of the annotated data is shown in Fig. 2. Total 
number of objects that are annotated for training and validation 
datastet are 1884. Training image dataset contains totally 1031

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in deep learning models like Mask R-CNN, we can infer that one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss over epochs. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or starts increasing, it might indicate that the model is starting to overfit the training data, suggesting that training should be stopped. Another commonly used criterion is setting a predefined maximum number of epochs, such as the mentioned 20 epochs in the context. In this case, even if the validation loss hasn't reached its minimum yet, training would still stop once the specified number of epochs is completed.
