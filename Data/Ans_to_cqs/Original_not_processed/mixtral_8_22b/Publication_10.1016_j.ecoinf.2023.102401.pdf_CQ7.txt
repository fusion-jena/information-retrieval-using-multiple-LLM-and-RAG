Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

dataset  contains  638  images,  divided  into  seven  categories,  with  510 
images for training and  128 for testing. The trash-ICRA19 dataset in-
cludes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training 
and 229 for testing. The VisDrone dataset is selected as part of the Tiny 
Target Dataset and comprises 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. 
The training set consists of 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 
images. NWPU VHR-10 and HRSID are small target datasets for remote 
sensing. The NWPU VHR-10 dataset includes 800 images with ten cat-
egories, and the training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, 
respectively. The HRSID dataset contains 5604 images in one category, 
and the training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respec-
tively. By testing YWnet on these diverse datasets, we aimed to assess its 
performance in various scenarios, including marine environments and 
detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.

Step 3: Evaluate the performance of the trained model by validating 
it against the test images. This involves computing metrics such as ac-
curacy,  recall,  F1  score,  and  other  relevant  measures.  Adjust  the  pa-
rameters and structure of the model based on the evaluation results to 
improve the detection performance. Iterate the training and evaluation 
process until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved.

The convolutional layer, batch normalization (BN) layer, and SiLU 
activation function are combined to form the CBS block. The SPPF (Li 
et  al.,  2021)  block  operates  three  maximum  pooling  layers,  and  then 
each branch is aggregated to the concat layer. It is capable of combining 
information  from  several  scales.  The  CRFPN  is  utilized  in  the  neck 
portion to combine the extractive features and convey information to the 
head  portion.  Finally,  the  head  predicts  and  presents  the  bounding 
boxes, classes, and concordance scores.

Helpful Answer:

The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the datasets were divided into training and testing sets. Typically, in machine learning and deep learning models, the data is often split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to fit the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the network. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model after all tuning has been completed.

In this case, the context only explicitly mentions the division of data into training and testing sets. For example, the trash-ICRA19 dataset was divided into 915 images for training and 229 for testing. Similarly, the VisDrone dataset had 1288 images for training and 332 for testing. Other datasets mentioned also have their respective training and testing splits.

However, there is no mention of any validation set or how the splitting was done (randomly, stratified, etc.). Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what specific criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
