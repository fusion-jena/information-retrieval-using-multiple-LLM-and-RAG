A topic that we did not discuss in this paper is edge computing (Davis 
et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2016), essentially meaning to process data before 
sending it  on the network and  thus improve  response times  and  save 
bandwidth. This requires processing power close to the sensor, which we 
have, but we used it to stream data to the network and not to reduce the 
amount of data to transmit. However, a reduction does happen at the 
edge of the cluster where data streams are transformed to event streams 
and  could  thus  also  happen  at  the  sensor,  given  sufficient  processing 
power for the task. An important advantage of reducing the amount of 
data  is  that  data  can  be  transferred  from  remote  locations  via  low 
bandwidth solutions, such as LoRa (a long range, low-power, wide area 
network modulation technique) or Starlink (satellite based internet ac-
cess). Although the architecture and online computational ethology in

developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis

users.

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not directly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general approaches can still be discussed. Data bias can occur due to various reasons like class imbalance, non-representative samples, etc. To mitigate these issues, several strategies can be employed:

1. Stratified splitting: When dealing with classification problems, especially those involving imbalanced classes, stratification ensures that each subset (training, validation, testing) maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. This helps prevent overestimation or underestimation of model performance.

2. Oversampling: This method involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular approach that generates new synthetic instances rather than simply replicating existing ones.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the majority class size to match the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple way to achieve this, although more sophisticated algorithms like NearMiss exist.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse datasets that represent all possible scenarios and variations can help minimize bias introduced by limited or skewed data sources. This may involve gathering information from multiple domains, geographical regions, demographics, etc.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often involves employing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets. These methods aim to ensure fair representation across different classes and characteristics within the dataset, ultimately improving model accuracy and reliability.
