In their review, Ma et al. [26] showed that nearly 200 publications using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been published in the ﬁeld of remote sensing by early 2019 of which most
focused on land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation [28], urban feature extraction [29–31], and
crop detection [32,33]. Deep learning approaches often require a large amount of training data, and
there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches
in the abovementioned remote sensing ﬁelds. Compared with the studies mentioned above, very
few studies using deep learning have focused on trees or forest classiﬁcation [34]. Flood et al. [35]
used a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution
three-band Earth-I imagery. In their research, a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled for training.
The ﬁnal results were pixel-wise and only two types (trees and large shrubs) were mapped. If there are

Deep learning approaches have become powerful tools for feature extraction and image processing
in computer vision [25] and even in remote sensing [26,27]. Deep learning approaches have proved
to be superior to traditional machine learning methods in a number of remote sensing applications.

that is, the tree species training sample and its quality. As long as the tree sample can be measured well
in ﬁeld work, deep learning networks will work well. Further, it is beneﬁcial to collect tree samples
with the aid of crowd sourcing. In terms of the sampled area in species diversity, our method is also
applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the ﬁeld work
or the requirements of species diversity estimation.

Helpful Answer:

The paper discusses the application of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping using high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, we can infer some possible methods based on the information provided.

For instance, the authors mention that they used high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. This suggests that they might have employed various sensors such as digital cameras for capturing RGB images and LiDAR scanners for obtaining detailed topographical information. Additionally, the authors note that their methodology could benefit from crowd-sourced tree samples, implying that citizen science initiatives or online platforms could potentially contribute to data collection efforts.

Moreover, the paper acknowledges that deep learning approaches often necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this requirement, the authors point out that there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing deep learning models in remote sensing fields like LULC classification, urban feature extraction, and crop detection. Although these datasets may not directly pertain to tree species diversity mapping, they underscore the significance of leveraging existing resources when gathering raw data for deep learning pipelines.

In summary, while the paper does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it implies that sensor technologies such as digital cameras and LiDAR scanners, along with crowd-sourced tree samples and publicly accessible benchmark datasets, could play crucial roles in acquiring necessary input data for deep learning applications in remote sensing.
