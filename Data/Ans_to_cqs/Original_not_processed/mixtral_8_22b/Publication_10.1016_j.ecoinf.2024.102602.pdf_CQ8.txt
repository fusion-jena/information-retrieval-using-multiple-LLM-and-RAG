workflow adopted, addressing any biases or ethical concerns associated 
with  deep  learning  applications  and  the  use  of  personal  data.  The 
collaborative  nature  of  our  approach,  where  the  public  contributes 
through citizen-science and social media platforms, can foster a sense of 
shared responsibility, which usually increases the trust in these methods 
(Liberatore et al., 2018).

Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

also  require  developments  to  infrastructures  and  programming  skills, 
which may not be accessible to a wide research community.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by A.S. Cardoso et al. is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is located based solely on this information. It could potentially be found on popular version control hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but further investigation would be required to confirm its location.
