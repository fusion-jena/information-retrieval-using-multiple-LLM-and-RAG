2.6. Generating prediction record 

After  neural  network  training  and  validation,  predictions  for  the 
entire  unvalidated  recording  period  were  generated.  Specifically,  for 
each of the five training folds, a single prediction for every 8 s-interval 
was made for the duration of the year. The five prediction records that 
resulted were then averaged together to create a single prediction re-
cord.  To  summarize  this  data  more  succinctly,  these  8  s-interval  pre-
dictions were then aggregated into hourly prediction records, containing 
the number of instances that each particular sound stimuli was predicted 
per  hour.  This  record  was  normalized  by  the  number  of  8-s  intervals 
actually recorded during that hour, to account for the possibility that 
missing audio data would render a given prediction record artificially 
low. 

2.7. Collecting weather data

Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead.

3.2. Validation database performance 

After training the neural network, the generalizability and robust-
ness of the model was further tested on the validation dataset. In the case 
of  the  small  portion  of  multi-label  data,  if  either  or  both  of  the  two 
labeled classes was output as a prediction, that prediction was consid-
ered to be correct. 

The network performance on all six validation days is summarized in 
Table 5. The average classification accuracy is 84.9%, with the lowest 
reported  accuracy  being  81.7%,  and  the  highest  being  88.6%.  Recall 
scores are fairly comparable.

(cid:0) 4 and a decay of 1×10

The  optimizer  Adam  was  selected  with  an  initial  learning  rate  of 
(cid:0) 7 and early stopping was used to prevent 
1×10
overfitting  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014).  Typically,  the  model  trained  be-
tween 10 and 15 epochs before training ceased, where each epoch took 
roughly 1 min on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. In addition to 
the conventional accuracy metric, the area under the curve, as computed 
by  a  Riemann  sum,  was  also  used  for  training.  From  the  assembled 
database of annotated clips, in each of the five cross-validation folds, 
10% of the data was reserved for comparing the training and validation 
loss/accuracy  after  each  epoch,  and  a  further  10%  was  reserved  for 
performance testing after all training had ceased. All results reported are 
the average after five-fold cross-validation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was validated using a diverse dataset consisting of six different days from various seasons throughout the year. Secondly, the authors employed k-fold cross-validation, specifically five-fold cross-validation, which involves dividing the dataset into k subsets and iteratively training the model on k−1 subsets while evaluating its performance on the remaining subset. This process helps reduce bias and variance in the model. Lastly, stratified sampling was applied when creating the training and validation datasets. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of labels remains consistent across the splits, preventing any class imbalance issues that could negatively impact the model's performance. These techniques collectively contribute to enhancing the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
