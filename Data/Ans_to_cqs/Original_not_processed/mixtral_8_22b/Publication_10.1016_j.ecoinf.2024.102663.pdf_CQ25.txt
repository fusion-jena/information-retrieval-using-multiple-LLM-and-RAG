1. Introduction 

Fish biomass estimation is essential for the fisheries and aquaculture 
industries  (Li  et  al.,  2020).  Manual  methods  of  estimation  can  be 
strenuous for the fish. Thus, there is a need for non-intrusive methods of 
fish  biomass  estimation.  Biomass  estimation  in  a  turbid  environment 
also comes with several challenges. This is where deep learning can play 
a  vital  role.  Training  a  deep  learning  model  on  large  datasets  of  fish 
images  can  provide  accurate  biomass  estimates  without  causing  un-
necessary  strain  to  the  fish  and  minimizes  manual  effort.  Hence,  the 
motivation of this research lies in providing an efficient, precise, and 
cost-effective  method  for  estimating  fish  biomass  in  turbid  environ-
ments. The reliance on fishing and aquaculture is a prominent charac-
teristic of numerous societies, playing a substantial role in bolstering the 

economic and social vitality of various nations and locations.

Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  deep  learning  techniques  to  pre-
processing under extreme conditions such as low light, extreme occlu-
sion, or overlapping of fish can address unique challenges by tailoring 
datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these 
datasets. Incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe (Abualigah et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2020) embeddings could enhance the detection and 
classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and 
semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass esti-
mates. Continuing to modify the architecture of deep learning models 
like YOLO, to better suit specific requirements, includes altering various 
parts of the architecture as needed to handle different environmental 
factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

machine learning models are used for other areas in fisheries, such as 
fish  species  identification  for  conducting  surveys  (Jalal  et  al.,  2020; 
Yassir et al., 2023), fish age estimation (Benzer et al., 2022; Politikos 
et al., 2021), finding length of the fish and catch numbers (Palmer et al., 
2022),  categorizing  squid  species  and  freshness  (Hu  et  al.,  2020), 
recognizing sea cucumber (Xuan et al., 2023), tuna aggregation (Baidai 
et al., 2020), and tuna biomass estimation (Precioso et al., 2022).

ecosystem restoration, and biodiversity conservation efforts. Integrating 
semantic  segmentation  into  ecological  studies  provides  a  powerful 
approach to understanding and managing ecosystems. Using advanced 
computational techniques, researchers can analyze large-scale ecolog-
ical  data  sets  more  efficiently,  leading  to  better-informed  decision- 
making and sustainable environmental management strategies.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily focused on fish biomass estimation. Deep learning models are being developed to provide accurate biomass estimates without causing unnecessary strain to the fish or requiring extensive manual effort. These models are designed to work effectively even in challenging environments, such as those characterized by turbidity, low light, extreme occlusion, or overlapping of fish.

To achieve this, the deep learning model may incorporate various architectures and techniques. For instance, it might utilize semantic segmentation, which involves classifying each pixel in an image into a category, such as 'fish' or 'background'. This technique can help in accurately identifying and quantifying fish biomass.

Moreover, the model might also employ object detection techniques, like YOLO (You Only Look Once), to locate individual fish instances within images. This can aid in counting the number of fish present, which is another crucial aspect of biomass estimation.

Additionally, the model might leverage Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks along with Global Vectors (GloVe) embeddings. These tools can improve the detection and classification of different fish species within the dataset, thereby enhancing the overall precision of fish biomass estimates.

In summary, the primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is to estimate fish biomass accurately and efficiently, using techniques such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and advanced embedding methods.
