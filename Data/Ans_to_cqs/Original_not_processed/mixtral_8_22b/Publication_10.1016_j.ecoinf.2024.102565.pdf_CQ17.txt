During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

To  overcome  data  limitations  and  enhance  the  robustness  of  the 
model  training  process,  this  study  employed  a  K-fold  cross-validation 
technique with K set to four. Unlike traditional approaches that segre-
gate  data  into  distinct  sets,  this  method  maximized  the  utilization  of 
both  on-site  and  RS  datasets,  integrating  them  comprehensively  into 
both training and validation phases (Aptoula and Ariman, 2021; Escoto

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances. While RUS is primarily used to handle class imbalance issues rather than preventing overfitting, other common regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves temporarily removing some neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies between neurons, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. These methods were not explicitly mentioned in the given context but could be potential solutions to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
