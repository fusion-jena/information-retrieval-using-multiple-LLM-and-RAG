training fashion, where the data labels are not utilized, the generative
model is frozen and detached and exclusively employed to extract fea-
tures for both training and testing data, following the representation
learning literature (D'inc`a et al., 2023; Franceschini et al., 2022; Kor-
omilas and Giannakopoulos, 2021; Paoletti et al., 2021d; Paoletti et al.,
2022a). These features are then used to train an MLP.

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

et al., 2023), which has input data sizes similar to ours while handling an
imbalanced dataset.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the process of feature extraction using a generative model and training an MLP for classification tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline.
