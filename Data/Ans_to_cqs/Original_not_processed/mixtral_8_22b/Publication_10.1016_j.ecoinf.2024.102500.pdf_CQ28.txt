3.2.1. Lazy predict algorithm 

Lazy Predict, a popular Python library, automates machine learning 
and offers 40 ML models. This large collection allows rigorous testing to 
find  the  best  forecasting  models  for  our  dataset.  Since  data  diversity

provide a thorough explanation of the complexities of data collecting 
and processing. Precipitation, maximum and lowest temperatures, the 
agricultural land use factor (ALUF), the forest land use factor (FLUF), the 
grassland usage factor (GLUF), the shrub land use factor (SLUF), and the 
urban land use factor (ULUF) are all included in the input data. The land 
use factors are defined as follows:

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
