on forest attributes, land use history, landscape, soil and climatic char-
acteristics. The questions we sought to answer were: (i) What are the 
most important variables to estimate net growth in these forests? (ii) Are 
the evaluated machine learning methods efficient for estimating the net 
growth at plot-level? and (iii) What is the best method to estimate the 
net growth at plot-level?

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of a specific platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
