Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning models for vegetation mapping and semantic segmentation. However, some common preprocessing techniques used in machine learning and deep learning include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. In this case, the authors mention using a data augmentation procedure during training and validation sets, which suggests that they may have applied other preprocessing techniques such as normalization or scaling to ensure consistent input data. Additionally, since the study uses spectral input data from remote sensing imagery, it can be assumed that standard image processing techniques like noise reduction and contrast enhancement might also have been employed. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing methods used, one cannot provide a definitive list of all the preprocessing steps involved before training their deep learning models.
