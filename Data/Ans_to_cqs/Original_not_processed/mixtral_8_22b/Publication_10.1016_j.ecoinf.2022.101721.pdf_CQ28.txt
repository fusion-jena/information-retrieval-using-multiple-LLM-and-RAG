include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects such as percentages, years, and methods related to species identification using machine learning and statistical modeling. However, it does not mention any details regarding the deployment of these models on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used for deploying the deep learning model based on the provided context.
