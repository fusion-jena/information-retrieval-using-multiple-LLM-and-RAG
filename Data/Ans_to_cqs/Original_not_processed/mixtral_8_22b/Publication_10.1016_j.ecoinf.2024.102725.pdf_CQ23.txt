3.4. Accuracy evaluation metrics

This study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to
render all of the NDVI images. Four evaluation metrics, the coefficient of
determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS), are employed
to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual
images.

R2 reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the refer-
ence images, with values ranging from -∞ to 1. An R2 value of 1 in-
dicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while
R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of
the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation. The calcu-
lation formula is as follows:

R2 = 1 (cid:0)

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it can be inferred that the researchers may have used diverse datasets, such as those from the Danjiang River Basin, to train their model. This would help improve its ability to predict NDVI reconstructions accurately across different environments. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been applied during the training process to further enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the methods section, we cannot confirm which specific strategies were implemented to guarantee the generalizability of the deep learning model.
