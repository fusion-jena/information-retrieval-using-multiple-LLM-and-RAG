5. Discussion and insights

X → Y

After the reliability and validity analysis, the fitness of the model fit
was tested using the data. To test the fitness of the model, we chose the
most commonly used model fit metrics where χ2/df represents the chi-
square value after considering the model complexity of 2.975, GFI
represents the goodness-of-fit index of 0.944, RMSEA represents the
approximate root-mean-square error of 0.089, the RMR indicates root
mean square deviation from 0.002, CFI indicates comparative goodness-
of-fit index of 0.913, NFI represents a normal goodness-of-fit index of
0.915, TLI indicates a standardized fit coefficient of 0.912, and IFI
represents a growth fit index of 0.929. All statistics exceeded the critical
value of 0.9 (Steiger and Vancouver, 1990) and met the criteria for
model fit with a high degree of goodness of fit, thus indicating an overall
fit of the SEM to the data.

We observed (Table 6) that the model provided in this study matches

(Leng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022c), ecological sustainability assessment
(Lu et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2022), farmer behavioral decision-making
and crop management system optimization (Ren et al., 2020), and

4.3.1. SEM reliability and fitness testing

The CFA was used to test the validity of the model construct. The
Cronbach alpha coefficient value was used to test the reliability of the
CFA for constructing SEM. The Cronbach alpha coefficient value in this
study was 0.737, and this is higher than the critical reliability of 0.6
(Cronbach, 1954), thus suggesting that the CFA possesses a considerable
level of reliability. And the CFA validity of SEA was measured by Bar-
tlett’s sphere (KMO) test, the KMO test coefficient in this study was
0.645 (greater than the critical value of 0.5), and the p-value was 0.000
(lower than the critical value of 0.005) (Wishart and Bartlett, 1932).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze factors influencing per capita carbon emissions from fertilizers (CEFs). However, there is no information regarding the completion criteria for training models or machine learning algorithms. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it would not be possible to provide an accurate response to the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
