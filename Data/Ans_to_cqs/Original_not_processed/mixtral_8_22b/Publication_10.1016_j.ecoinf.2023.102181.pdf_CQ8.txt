Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model. 

5. Conclusions

Recognizing the potential confluence of these factors, we believe it 
may be efficient to address issues of biased model training and valida-
tion simultaneously in some cases. Here we focus specifically on boot-
strap aggregation applications (i.e., “bagging”; Breiman, 1996), which 
are now widely applied for predictive geospatial modelling, for example, 
as implemented via Random Forest (Breiman, 2001). The bagging pro-
cess itself provides a useful probability-based mechanism for addressing 
both sources of bias using bootstrapping. Spatially correlated map errors 
may result from modelling of clustered sample data, and we propose to 
correct for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using 
residual spatial autocorrelation information in the bagging procedure. 
This  is  achieved  by  determining  weights  according  to  empirical  esti-
mates of spatially autocorrelated errors to first reduce bias during model

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly point out where the code repository of such a deep learning pipeline might be available. However, based on the references mentioned, there are no explicit links to popular version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be best to search for relevant repositories related to the research papers cited or consult their respective authors for more accurate information.
