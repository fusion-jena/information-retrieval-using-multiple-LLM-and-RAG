%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to develop the U-Net model for identifying Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species in Brazil. However, it is common knowledge that popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can be used to implement convolutional neural networks like U-Net. Therefore, without further information from the authors or the source code, we cannot definitively determine which framework was utilized in this work.
