number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

thereby limiting the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient 
and making the function smoother. This property ensures more stable 
parameter  changes  and  reduces  the  likelihood  of  gradient  explosion 
during neural network optimization, leading to improved training sta-
bility of the model. 

Spectral normalization(Miyato et al., 2018) achieved Lipschitz con-
tinuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each 
layer  of  the  network  in  the  discriminator.  This  approach  is  simple, 
efficient,  and  does  not  require  additional  hyperparameter  tuning. 
Therefore,  it  is  widely  adopted  to  train  stable  GANs(Li  et  al.,  2022a; 
Zhang et al., 2019a).

In  the  DR-ACGAN  model,  we  utilize  spectral  normalization  in  the 
discriminator  instead  of  batch  normalization  (BN)  to  stabilize  the 
training process. As the activation function is linear, we only need to 
enforce  Lipschitz  constraints  on  the  parameters  of  the  convolutional 
kernel and the fully connected layer to ensure Lipschitz continuity. By 
defining  the  weight  matrix  as  W  and  the  input  data  as  X,  we  can 
calculate the spectral norm using the formula (6). 

σ(W) := max

where σ(W), also referred to as the L2 norm of the matrix, represents the 
computation of the maximum singular value of that matrix. The process 
of spectral normalization can be defined by the formula (7).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts towards improving the stability and robustness of the model. For instance, the use of spectral normalization in the discriminator instead of batch normalization aims to stabilize the training process. Additionally, enforcing Lipschitz constraints on the parameters of the convolutional kernel and the fully connected layer helps maintain Lipschitz continuity, which contributes to the overall stability of the model. While these aspects may indirectly contribute to enhancing the generalizability of the model, they primarily focus on ensuring its stability during training rather than addressing the issue directly.
