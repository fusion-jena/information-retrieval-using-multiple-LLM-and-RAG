The success plot is defined by the overlap of the bounding boxes. The 
success plot indicates the ratio of successful frames when the specific 
threshold  varies  from  zero  to  one  (Wu  et  al.,  2015).  The  higher  the 
success rate, the greater the degree of overlap between the bounding box 
and ground truth. The bounding box is marked as a, and the box ob-
tained by manual labeling is denoted as b. The overlap rate Soverlap can be 
defined as 

SOverlap =

|a ∩ b|
,
|a ∪ b|

where ∣ • ∣ represents the number of pixels in the region; and ∩ denotes 
the intersection and union of two regions. When the Soverlap  of a frame

opoda  melanoleuca).  A  total  of  42  videos  with  three  types  of  motion 
trajectory patterns, namely, straight line, 8-shaped curve, and circular 
curve, were included in the dataset. Fig. 7 depicts a few examples, and 
Table 2 lists the details of the dataset.
