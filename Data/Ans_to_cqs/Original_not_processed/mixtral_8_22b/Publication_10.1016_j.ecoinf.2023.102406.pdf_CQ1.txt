Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2. Methods 

2.1. Species samples and thinning

4.5. Sample thinning 

Sample  thinning  had  very  little  effect  on  accuracy  or  variable 
importance,  or  mapped  models,  indicating  no  clear  benefits  for 
tampering  with  samples  that  may  provide  information  about  species 
characteristics and responses to the environment. It is not necessary to 
add another modeling step that involves many choices, although thin-
ning  may  be  beneficial  if  thousands  of  samples  were  taken  from  one 
study site. An outcome of reducing samples is that minimum sample size 
thresholds need to be lowered to maintain the same species pool. Sample 
thinning does provide a confirmation that sample size is not as critical as 
capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution.

removing  information  contained  in  samples  may  not  produce  clear 
benefits.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not explicitly mention any specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it discusses the process of'sample thinning,' which could imply that some form of sampling was employed to gather the initial dataset. This technique involves removing certain samples from the dataset without significantly affecting the overall model performance, accuracy, or variable importance. In this case, the study suggests that sample thinning did not have much impact on these factors, implying that the original dataset might have been robust enough to handle such reductions. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what method was used to collect the raw data based solely on the provided context, we can infer that some form of sampling was likely involved.
