and time overhead (Ke et al., 2017). LightGBM sets itself apart from
other tree-based methods through its leaf-wise splitting approach, which
generates more intricate trees. These trees are adept at minimising loss,
leading to enhanced accuracy. The splitting process is guided by a
unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling
(GBOSS) (Ke et al., 2017). This method excludes data with small gra-
dients while utilising the remainder for estimating information gain and
facilitating tree growth. A collection of hyperparameters, such as lear-
ning_rate, max_depth, bagging_fraction, bagging_freq, and n_estimators,
controls the algorithm. These parameters are crucial in shaping how the
leaves are structured within the trees. The model's complexity gradually
rises as the tree grows, guided by these parameters. Simultaneously, loss
decreases, and the algorithm becomes more adept at learning from the
data, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, this model is suscep-

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

construct regression equations. We used multiple linear regression, Enet,
SVM, RF, XGboost and LightGBM to predict canopy cover from planet
data. In general, all the mentioned models are used in machine learning
as they use algorithms to automatically learn patterns and relationships
from data to make predictions or decisions. However, we categorised

For machine learning models, the GARI, GI, GNDVI, GREEN, MSR,
NDVI, RDVI, RED, SI2, and VARIg were selected as described earlier in
the methodology sections. The performance of the models is presented
in Table 6. In the testing dataset, it was observed that all models
demonstrated lower coefficients of determination than the training data,
except for the linear and Enet models. Machine learning algorithms
outperformed linear in modelling forest canopy cover. The LightGBM
exhibited the most substantial model training ability (R2 = 0.69), fol-
lowed by SVM, RF and XGboost, each with an R2 value of 0.66. All six
models yielded satisfactory results with an R2 ≥ 0.58 in training data,
meeting our study's canopy cover prediction criteria. Further evaluation
in independent
test samples, considering additional fit statistics,
XGboost and LightGBM demonstrated superior predictive capabilities
with R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.16, rRMSE = 22%, and MAE = 0.12, out-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the provided text mentions any specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
