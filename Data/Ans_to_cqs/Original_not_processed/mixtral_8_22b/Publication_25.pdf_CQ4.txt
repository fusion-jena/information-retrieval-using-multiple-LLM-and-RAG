combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses two strategies to address the issue of limited training data in deep learning applications for natural systems like tree detection: semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning.

In semi-supervised learning, a combination of labeled and unlabeled data is used within a semi-supervised framework. This allows neural networks to learn generalized features from a larger set of training examples before being fine-tuned on a smaller number of high-quality annotations. Although this strategy could potentially help improve deep learning performance on limited training data, it remains uncertain if lower-quality annotations can be utilized effectively for initial model training due to the limitations of current unsupervised tree delimitation approaches.

Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, employs unsupervised methods to create training data that can then be used to train supervised models. This technique has been successfully implemented in remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification. Since self-supervision solely depends on unlabeled data, it might offer a promising solution to overcome the data limitation challenges faced in deep learning applications.

While these strategies do not directly correspond to traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, they still contribute to enhancing the amount and diversity of available training data, thereby improving the overall performance of deep learning models.
