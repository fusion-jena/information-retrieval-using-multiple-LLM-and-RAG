Making decisions  about the most  appropriate  survey  methods and 
monitoring schemes is a key step in the conservation and management of 
bobwhite  and  other  species.  The  financial  and  labor  costs  of  each 
method  vary  greatly  and  across  different  points  in  the  process.  For 
example, the purchase of multiple ARUs is initially expensive (generally 
around $300â€“$500 dollars a unit), yet is a more cost effective long term

Helpful Answer:
The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub under GAMELab-UGA. You can find it at <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA>. This includes both R and JAGS code, as well as Python source code used to design, train, and test the northern bobwhite detector. Additionally, a pre-trained model is available for download.
