As commonly done in deep learning, we iteratively learn the model
parameters with stochastic gradient descend, starting from a random
initialization. In each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of 𝐵 = 64
reference data patches of size 15 × 15 pixels, where a patch is only
considered for training if the center pixel is forested. We consider a
pixel forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with
𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m, see Section 3.1) and also is considered forested based on
NIBIO’s Norway-wide timber volume map (Astrup et al., 2019). We use
the latter as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary
noise from non-forested areas, as we are interested in learning forest
characteristics only. For every reference data patch, we randomly pick
an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one as-
cending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one
of the optical image. Using SAR with both ascending and descending

2.2. Deep learning in remote sensing

In the last decade, deep learning has revolutionized the way infor-
mation is extracted from images. In particular, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented results in areas like
image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman,
2015; He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2016), object detection (Szegedy et al., 2013; Girshick et al.,
2014; Redmon et al., 2016) and further perception tasks.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors are using a deep learning approach to extract information from images, specifically focusing on forest characteristics. They use a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for their analysis.

The process involves sampling batches of reference data patches of size 15x15 pixels, considering only those patches where the central pixel is forested. This implies that some form of labeling or annotation might be involved to identify which pixels correspond to forests. However, the exact technique used for this purpose is not mentioned in the provided context.

For each reference data patch, they select corresponding optical and SAR images. While this doesn't directly relate to traditional data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it suggests a form of data association or alignment between different types of images.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does suggest that some form of labeling or annotation is being used to identify forested areas in the images.
