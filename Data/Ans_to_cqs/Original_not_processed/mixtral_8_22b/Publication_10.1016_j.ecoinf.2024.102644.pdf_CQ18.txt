minimum MaxEnt value for a cell to be classified as a suitable species’ 
habitat during model training. One possible bias with this approach is 
that if the threshold were too low, the model would overestimate species 
presence in all projection years. However, our decision thresholds were 
not biased because the T and P changes - combined with the other pa-
rameters within complex prediction functions in the MaxEnt models - 
frequently produced very different cell values across the years (Section 
3.1). Model thresholding was also necessary, before model combination 
for  species  richness  estimation,  because  the  different  species  models 
were mutually independent and their probability distributions had very 
different  shapes.  This  condition  is  common  for  non-linear  machine- 
learning  models  (Austin  et  al.,  2022;  Card  et  al.,  2019;  Coro  et  al., 
2013b; Coro et al., 2018; Coro et al., 2022c; Coro et al., 2024).

on identifying a complete set of environmental parameters related to the 
species’  subsistence  (Pearson,  2007).  Therefore,  parameter  selection 
methods are often used before ENMs (Bargain et al., 2017; Coro et al., 
2013a;  Coro  et  al.,  2015b;  Coro  et  al.,  2015c;  Guo  and  Liu,  2010; 
Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019;  Muscarella  et  al.,  2014;  S´anchez-Tapia  et  al., 
2017; Schnase et al., 2021; Warren and Seifert, 2011; Zeng et al., 2016). 
ENMs use statistical analysis, machine learning, or expert-defined rules 
to  estimate  the  species’  ecological  niche  as  a  predictive  function  be-
tween  habitat  suitability  conditions  and  the  input  environmental  pa-
rameters.  One  input  to  an  ENM  is,  therefore,  a  set  of  environmental 
parameters related to species’  subsistence in the analysis area, homo-
geneously defined on the area at a specific spatial resolution (Alvera- 
Azc´arate et al., 2005; Durand et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2008; Peterson,

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the minimum MaxEnt value was used as a threshold for classifying a cell as a suitable species' habitat during model training. It also states that the decision thresholds were not biased due to the fact that temperature (T) and precipitation (P) changes, along with other parameters within complex prediction functions in the MaxEnt models, frequently produced very different cell values across the years. Additionally, the text notes that model thresholding was necessary before combining the different species models for species richness estimation, as they were mutually independent and had very different probability distributions. These details suggest that the model performance may have been monitored by evaluating the consistency and variability of predicted cell values across time and between different species models.
