Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions sections discussing the model's advantages, limitations, future work, and a summary of its main findings. Additionally, keywords related to environmental flows, riparian ecosystems, wetlands, and biodiversity maintenance are mentioned, along with a drought period from the mid-90s to late 2010. However, none of this information provides details about the deployment platform for the deep learning model.
