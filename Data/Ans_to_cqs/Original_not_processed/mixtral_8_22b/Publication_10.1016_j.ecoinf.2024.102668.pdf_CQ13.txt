bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it focuses on comparing different audio recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds, discussing the utility of acoustic indices for ecological monitoring, and addressing differences between recording devices. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in any potential deep learning models.
