In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

In recent years, it has been observed that deep learning methods can 
be trained with close to zero training error efficiently. The number of 
convolutional and dense layers directly affects the runtime of the model 
(Bienstock et al., 2023). The running time of a DL model increases in 
polynomial-terms with the increased number of associated layers. But 
with the effort of achieving zero error, there are possibilities of over-
training and biased training. To avoid these situations, a restrictive and 
gradually increasing training cycle and accuracy calculation approach 
has  been  adopted.  Based  on  mean  square  error  (MSE),  the  optimal 
training state for the model has been obtained.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include lr0, Lrf, momentum, weight\_decay, warmup\_epochs, warmup\_momentum, warmup\_bias\_lr, box, cls, cls\_pw, obj, obj\_pw, iou\_t, anchor\_t, fl\_gamma, hsv\_h, hsv\_s, hsv\_v, degrees, translate, scale, shear, Perspective, flipud, fliplr, mosaic, mixup, and copy\_paste. Their respective values are listed in Table 2. For example, the value of lr0 is 0.01, while the value of Lrf is also 0.01. These hyperparameters play crucial roles in determining the performance of the deep learning model during training.
