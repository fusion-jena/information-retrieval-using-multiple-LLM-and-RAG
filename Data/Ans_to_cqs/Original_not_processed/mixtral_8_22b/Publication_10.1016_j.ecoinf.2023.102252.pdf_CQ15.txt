whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

where D2 is the dry spell duration that causes the species to decline to the 
worst possible condition. It is defined depending on whether the target is 
on a recovery or declining trajectory. 

D2 = D2,D(1 (cid:0) T) + D2,RT,

D2,R = γICδ,

D2,D = ζICη.

Eqs.  (13)  and  (14)  ensure  a  physically  meaningful  D2  value  by 
asserting that the time taken to decline to the lowest condition is zero if 
the target is already in a lower condition. 

4.1.3. Distance weighting under dry spell 

Three parameters are included to bound the target’s condition below 
based  on  the  proximity  to  any  river  channel  (Table  1).  Even  though 
flooding  is  a  significant  driver  of  ecological  health  in  floodplains, 
ecological targets sufficiently close to the river channel can maintain at 
least  a  minimum  condition  without  flooding.  The worst  condition  Cw 
becomes a variable and is calculated as:
