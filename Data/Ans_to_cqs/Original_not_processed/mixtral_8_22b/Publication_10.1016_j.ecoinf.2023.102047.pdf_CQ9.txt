0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

The YOLOv5 network has three parts: i) backbone: CSPDarknet; ii) 
neck: PANet; and iii) head: YOLO layer. It utilises CSPDarknet53 as the 
backbone by incorporating the crossstage partial network (CSPNet) into 
Darknet (Wang et al., 2020b). A path aggregation network (PANet) (He 
et  al.,  2016)  is  applied  to  this  network  to  boost  information  flow.  In 
PANet, a feature pyramid network (FPN) is adopted with an enhanced

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the sources mentioned provide specific information about where the data repositories of the deep learning pipelines are available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data repository contains the relevant data for each study. However, some common data repositories used for scientific research include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. Researchers may have chosen to use one or more of these platforms to store and share their data. To find out where the data repository of a particular study is located, readers can refer to the original publication or contact the authors directly.
