We  explored  dimensionality  reduction  as  a  way  to  evaluate  the  suit-
ability  of  a  model  for  transfer  learning.  To  compare  embeddings 
generated by models using data not included in their training (unseen) 
we used the Brazil extract of the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset. We generated 
embeddings  for  this  dataset  using  three  different  models:  VGGish, 
BirdNET and a ResNet152-architecture model trained from scratch on 
the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset complementary to the Brazil extract. In all 
cases we used UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings to 
2  dimensions.  We  calculated  metrics  for  the  UMAP  results  of  each 
model,  using  the  dataset  classes  as  labels  to  calculate  the  silhouette 
coefficient  (Table  3).  Scatterplots  in  Fig.  6  show  the  results  for  each 
model using markers to indicate different species.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the authors drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET) and compared it to their SincNet trained models. They also experimented with dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP. Additionally, they calculated metrics for the UMAP results of each model, including the silhouette coefficient. Therefore, while the exact evaluation metrics used are not specified, it can be inferred that some form of comparison between models was performed, possibly involving measures like accuracy, precision, or recall.
