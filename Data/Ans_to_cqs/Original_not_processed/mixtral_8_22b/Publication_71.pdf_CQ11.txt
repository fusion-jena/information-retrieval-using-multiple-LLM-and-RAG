earlier results in Table 7 in which only 30,000 samples were used to train the CNN model. Here, all the
training samples in the Vasiliko image were used. The resultant vegetation map is shown in Figure 10.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would require additional resources and information to accurately determine the correct data repository link for this deep learning pipeline.
