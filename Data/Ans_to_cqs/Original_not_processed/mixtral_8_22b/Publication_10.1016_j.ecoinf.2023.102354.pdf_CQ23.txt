Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

lies  in  exploring the  potential of  deep  learning and  machine  learning 
algorithms  for  enhancing  groundwater-climate  interactions  under-
standing and investigating the climatic hotspots implications within the 
sub-basins of the GAB region.

5.5. Relevance for policy and management

up to two metres categorised into layers of 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 40 cm, 40 to 
100  cm, and 100  to 200 cm. In other words, rivers, lakes,  and water 
trapped below 2 m from the land are not covered by GLDAS-Noah (Bi 
et al., 2016). However, rivers and lakes were also not considered in our 
technique for estimating GWS due to the lack of notable surface water 
storage (<3%) change throughout the study region (Yan et al., 2017). In 
this study, SMS data was obtained using GLDAS observations from 2002 
to  2017.  GLDAS-derived  SMS  was  used  with  GRACE-derived  TWS  to 
quantify GWS variations across the region.

%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken based solely on this context.
