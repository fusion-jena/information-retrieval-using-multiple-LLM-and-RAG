3.1. Training Evaluation

The model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU,
and mAP, as seen in Table 2. The scores are calculated from model validation data, consisting of
321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score are seen to follow each other closely, given indications on
the training at diﬀerent stages, the model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4, whereafter they
continue to increase but at a slower rate. At the end of the training, the model achieved the accuracy
scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. The GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is
becoming better at correctly locating targets.

Model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8 GB of memory,
with a training time of 4.9 min per epoch. With the adaptive learning rate algorithms usually yielding
higher model accuracies than static ones [16], the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the
static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Both the basic SGD and its further adaptive developments are
popular in neural network applications [17], but given the ﬁndings of [18,19], which proved Adam’s
usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images), the Adam optimizer is chosen for
the model of this study. Hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully
implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based “Yolt” model [14] suggests
implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. The default parameters of YoloV3 are
0.001, 0.9 and 0.0005 for the learning rate momentum and weight decay, respectively, and we decided

Helpful Answer:
According to the information provided, the hyperparameters of the model were set based on successful implementations of YOLO in remote sensing cases. Specifically, the author of the YOLO-based "Yolt" model suggested implementing the same hyperparameters as the YOLO model. The default parameters of YOLOv3 were used, which include a learning rate of 0.001, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. It appears that no specific optimization method such as grid search or random search was mentioned in the text.
