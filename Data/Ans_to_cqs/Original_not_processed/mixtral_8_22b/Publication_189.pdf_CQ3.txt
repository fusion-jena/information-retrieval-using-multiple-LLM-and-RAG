Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  most  time-consuming  step  after  data  gathering  is 
annotation.  Annotation  of  images  means  manual  labelling  of 
data by assigning some keywords/labels on the required areas in 
the  image  to  assign  metadata.  For  annotating  the  dataset,  the 
broders of objects were outlined to associate every single pixel 
of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label. There 
are various tools available in the market to annotate the images, 
but  this  research  used  Computer  Vision  Annotation  Tool 
(CVAT) [21] which is developed by Intel for labelling of data. 
The annotation data was then converted into COCO 1.0 dataset 
which was formatted in JSON and it is a collection of object id, 
image id, category id, segmentation, area, bbox, attributes, etc. 
The illustration of the annotated data is shown in Fig. 2. Total 
number of objects that are annotated for training and validation 
datastet are 1884. Training image dataset contains totally 1031

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the primary data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. This involves manually labeling or outlining the borders of objects within images to associate each pixel of the object with a specific tag or label. The process is carried out using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) developed by Intel. After annotation, the data is converted into the COCO 1.0 dataset format, which includes information such as object ID, image ID, category ID, segmentation, area, bounding box, and attributes.

Instance segmentation is a more detailed approach compared to other methods like bounding box annotation. While bounding box annotation only requires drawing a rectangle around the object, instance segmentation demands precise outlines of the object's shape. This makes it a more time-consuming task but also provides richer and more accurate data for training deep learning models.

Other data annotation techniques mentioned indirectly in the context include semantic segmentation and region of interest extraction. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category, while region of interest extraction focuses on identifying and extracting relevant parts of an image for further processing. However, these techniques are not explicitly stated as being used in the described deep learning pipeline.
