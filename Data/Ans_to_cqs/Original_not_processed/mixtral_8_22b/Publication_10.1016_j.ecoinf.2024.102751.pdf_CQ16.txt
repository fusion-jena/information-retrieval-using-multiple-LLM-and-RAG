The developed predictive model was characterized by the following
values of model accuracy evaluation parameters: MAE – 4.1%; RMSE –
5.6%; R2–0.49. The value of Mean absolute error is (MAE) shows that
prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual VWC. RMSE 5.6% is slightly
higher than MAE because it squares the errors before averaging, giving
more weight to larger errors. It provides a similar interpretation to MAE
but emphasizes larger prediction errors. R2 value 0.49 shows that the
model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values. This
model indicates the moderate ability of the model to capture the relation
between the explanatory variable and VWC.

• The model suggests that grassland shows exhibits high VWC, con-
firming importance of vegetation cover in water storage capacity.
• The developed model provides a useful foundation for understanding
water retention patterns on the coal mining heap, aiding the recla-
mation planning, and monitoring the success of the restoration.
• Investigating temporal VWC dynamics using time-series satellite
imagery will reveal seasonal and inter-annual variations. The
model’s applicability can be assessed by extending it to other post-
mining sites or regions. Integrating the model into decision support
tools will enable real-time monitoring and management of post-
mining landscapes. Exploring machine learning algorithms could
further improve predictive power and uncover hidden relationships
within the dataset.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
There isn't specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given context. However, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation Loss Plateau: When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each epoch, this may indicate that further training would not result in significant improvements.
* Early Stopping: Training is stopped early if the performance on a validation set does not improve after a certain number of iterations.
* Maximum Number of Iterations: Training can also stop once a maximum number of iterations have been reached.
* Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule where the learning rate is reduced over time. Once the learning rate reaches a minimum threshold, training can be considered complete.
