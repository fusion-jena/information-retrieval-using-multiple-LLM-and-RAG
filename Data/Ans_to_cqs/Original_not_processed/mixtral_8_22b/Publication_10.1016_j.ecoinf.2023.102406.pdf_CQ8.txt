Tree species encompassed 80 tree species, which at least occurred in 
Mexico but were not endemic, and abundantly surveyed with 1000 to 
5000  observations  in  the  study  extent  of  North  America.  The  Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility, 2023) is a centralized data repository containing 65,000 data-
sets  of  2  billion  species  observations.  I  filtered  tree  species  that  were 
observed  since  1990  in  North  America  with  coordinate  uncertainty 
<1000  m  (GBIF  occurrence  download  https://doi.org/10.15468/

number  of  random  points  from  the  study  extent,  or  background.  I 
extracted climate variables for the occurrences and background absence 
points. Additionally, I also thinned the samples to a maximum of one 
sample  per  grid  cell  within  the  climate  raster  layers,  with  an  equal

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any specific details about a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of such a deep learning pipeline might be available, whether it be on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
