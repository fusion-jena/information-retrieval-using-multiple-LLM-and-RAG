to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (Doll´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the references to object detection, tracking, and identification, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for object detection tasks. This is further supported by the mention of models like YOLOv7, which are known for their use in real-time object detection applications. Additionally, the context mentions the integration of Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN) and cascade-based modeling, both of which are commonly used in object detection models. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it appears that the deep learning model discussed here is primarily intended for object detection purposes.
