For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was split into a training set and an evaluation set, with 80% of the data being used for training and the remaining 20% for evaluating the performance of the models. This approach allowed for thorough assessment of the precision of the models. Secondly, two metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). These metrics helped to quantify the predictive power of the models. Thirdly, committee averaging and weighted mean approaches were applied to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. Ensemble modeling is a technique that combines multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Lastly, when selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those with a TSS score of ≥0.7. This ensured that only the most accurate and reliable models were chosen for making predictions about the impact of climate change on plant species distributions. Overall, these measures helped to increase the robustness and reliability of the deep learning models, ensuring their generalizability to new datasets and conditions.
