Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors collected raw data using various methods suitable for their research objectives. They gathered environmental, climatic, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic variables to analyze the factors influencing the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region.

For environmental and climatic variables, they used data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which includes maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation. For soil variables, they employed OpenLandMap resources like Soil Water Content, Soil Organic Carbon Content, and Soil pH in H2O. Additionally, they incorporated Lembrechts et al.'s (2020) work on soil temperature.

To obtain topographic information, the researchers relied on GTOPO30, providing elevation, slope, and aspect data. Lastly, for anthropogenic variables, they sourced Weiss et al.'s (2018) distance to city data and Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4)'s human population density data.

However, it is essential to note that the specific methodology for gathering raw data may vary depending on the requirements of each individual project or study. In some cases, researchers might use additional techniques such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, or even crowdsourcing platforms to collect relevant data.
