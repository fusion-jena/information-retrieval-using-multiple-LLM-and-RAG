where AA_SHAPj  is the average of the absolute SHAP values for input 
variable j (i.e., the daily average temperature on day j), ni is the number

et al., 2016), and LightGBM 3.2.1 (Ke et al., 2017) libraries. In building a 
machine  learning  model,  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the 
model must be determined, such as the number of decision trees and the 
depth of trees for RF models and the number of intermediate layers and 
nodes for ANN models. We optimized the structure and hyperparameters 
of the RF and ANN models using Optuna 2.10.0 (Akiba et al., 2019) with 
the  parameters  and  ranges  shown  in  Table  1  as  candidates.  For  the 
LightGBM models, we used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integra-
tion.lightgbm)  for hyperparameter  fitting.  The  performance of  the  al-
gorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared 
error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute 
error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated 
for reference.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods were employed for this purpose.

Based on the given context, the study focuses on developing machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM algorithms to predict the timing of cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan. The authors use meteorological data from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). However, there is no mention of how this data was collected or what specific sensors or instruments were used. Additionally, the paper does not discuss any survey methods or public datasets used for gathering data.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can only be concluded that meteorological data from AMeDAS was used in the development of the machine learning models. Further details regarding the collection of raw data in the deep learning pipeline cannot be determined from the provided context.
