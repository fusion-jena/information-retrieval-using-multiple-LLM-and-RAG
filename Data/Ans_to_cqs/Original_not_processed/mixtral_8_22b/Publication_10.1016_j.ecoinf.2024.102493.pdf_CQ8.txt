Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the availability of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by Z. Gu et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available based on this information alone. It could potentially be found on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but further research would be required to confirm its location.
