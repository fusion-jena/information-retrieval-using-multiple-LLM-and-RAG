In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in the field of 
image  recognition,  thus  greatly  improving  computer  processing. Con-
volutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning architecture 
applied to image classification with good performance in the extraction 
of underlying abstract features (Meng et al., 2022). Convolution layers, 
pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations consti-
tute the CNN model (Attri et al., 2023). We fine-tuned several state-of- 
the-art  CNN  architectures,  including  the  Visual  Geometry  Group 
(VGG)  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014),  Inception  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), and residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016) CNNs, using the 
training dataset, and we evaluated their respective  performances. We 
selected from these networks the most effective model to create the rural

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular project. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label or tag datasets so they can be used to train machine learning models effectively. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify them. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image according to its class, while instance segmentation identifies individual instances of objects. Polygon annotation uses shapes other than rectangles to outline objects more precisely. Key point annotation marks specific points on objects, such as joints on humans, and landmark annotation identifies important features like facial features.
