To quantitatively evaluate the classification performance, 
average  accuracy(AA),  overall  accuracy  (OA)  and  kappa 
coefficient (K) are  selected as performance  measures. Here, 
OA represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples 
in  the  total  samples;  AA  represents  the  average  of  each 
category classification accuracies; Kappa coefficient is used 
to  measure

for  consistency 
classification accuracy. Kappa coefficient is a consistency test 
metric.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  experiment  is  performed  on  the  UAV  hyperspectral 
image  described  in  section  II.  There  are  ten  different  land-
cover  classes  in  the  captured  UAV  hyperspectral  image  as 
shown in Table I. Considering it is hard to label hyperspectral 
image in the real world, we split the labeled pixels of UAV 
hyperspectral image into the training set and test set with the 
ratio 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights 
and  biases  of  the  network,  and  the  test  samples  are  used  to 
evaluate the classification performance.

What needs illustration is that before classifying the pixel 
f  unknown  categories  in  the  image,  it  is  necessary  to  first 
optimize  the  connections  (weights)  of  the  network  by using 
the labeled pixels. In this paper, the cross-entropy is selected 
as  the  cost  function  and  the  stochastic  gradient  descent 
algorithm is used to optimize model weights. 

The cross-entropy cost function is defined as(cid:726)

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, considering common practices in machine learning, one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss during training. When the validation loss reaches a plateau or starts increasing while the training loss continues decreasing, it might indicate overfitting, suggesting that the training should stop. Another commonly used criterion is setting a fixed number of epochs for training, which can also help prevent overfitting. Additionally, early stopping based on the validation loss can be employed to halt training if no improvement is observed after several consecutive epochs. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the context, these suggestions remain speculative.
