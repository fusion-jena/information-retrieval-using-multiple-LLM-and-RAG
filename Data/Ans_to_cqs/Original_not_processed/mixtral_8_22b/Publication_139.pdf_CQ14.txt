2.4.1. Training database assembly 

To assemble a training database, three randomly selected days from 
each month of the calendar year (see Table 1) were selected for anno-
tation. Select spectrogram images were manually labeled via visual in-
spection by two trained graduate students into a set of sound categories 
that evolved as the year progressed. On average, around 60 images could 
be  annotated  per  minute,  which  corresponds  to  8  min  of  audio  data. 
Therefore,  annotating  every  single  spectrogram  from  a  single  day 
(10,800 images) would take 3 h. Assembling the training database took 
less time in practice because only 10–15% of the spectrograms from each 
of the selected days were actually annotated (many spectrograms which 
contained only background noise were simply not needed). 

In total, this database consists of over 40 k images of bio-, anthro- 
and  geophonies.  The  full  contents  of  the  database  are  presented  in 
Table 2.

(cid:0) 4 and a decay of 1×10

The  optimizer  Adam  was  selected  with  an  initial  learning  rate  of 
(cid:0) 7 and early stopping was used to prevent 
1×10
overfitting  (Kingma  and  Ba,  2014).  Typically,  the  model  trained  be-
tween 10 and 15 epochs before training ceased, where each epoch took 
roughly 1 min on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. In addition to 
the conventional accuracy metric, the area under the curve, as computed 
by  a  Riemann  sum,  was  also  used  for  training.  From  the  assembled 
database of annotated clips, in each of the five cross-validation folds, 
10% of the data was reserved for comparing the training and validation 
loss/accuracy  after  each  epoch,  and  a  further  10%  was  reserved  for 
performance testing after all training had ceased. All results reported are 
the average after five-fold cross-validation.

Five bird calls were detected in sufficient numbers (over 300 training 
examples) to be included in the training database, and any birds without 
sufficient numbers were placed in a generic category for miscellaneous 
calls. Species present in this category include the American goldfinch 
(Spinus  tristis),  the  song  sparrow  (Melospiza  melodia),  and  the  black- 
capped  chickadee  (Poecile  atricapillus).  In  the  case  of  the  former  two, 
less than 20 min of calling activity was detected during the annotation 
phase, and in the case of the song sparrow it was quite faint and indis-
tinct. Less than 5 min of chickadee calling activity was observed.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the optimizer Adam was selected with an initial learning rate of (cid:0) 7. This suggests that some form of optimization process was employed, but the specific method (grid search, random search, etc.) is not mentioned. Additionally, early stopping was used to prevent overfitting, indicating that the performance of the model on a validation set was monitored during training.
