Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

other programming languages are also used, such as the Deep Learning 
Toolbox  by  MathWorks  (Beale  et  al.,  2018),  cuDNN  (Chetlur  et  al., 
2014), and Darknet (Redmon, 2013–2016).

2.  A CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance should be created on Google Cloud. Various choices are available by searching for ‘CUDA’ in the 
Google Cloud ‘Marketplace’. We recommend a VM named “Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97”, as it comes with the necessary drivers 
and compilers pre-installed. At the time of writing, this instance uses CUDA 11.6. Documentation is available if additional information about 
similar Google Cloud VMs is required.  

3.  The VM can be launched using the ‘Launch’ button on the aforementioned page, after which the required hardware specification of the VM must be 
selected. For most small projects, 16GB of memory and an SSD boot drive of 30GB should suffice. The number and type of GPUs can be selected at 
this stage.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the code repository. However, some clues from the text suggest that the authors might have used popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with other tools like the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These libraries usually have their own repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the specific code repository related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper, one would need more detailed information or search for relevant keywords on these platforms.
