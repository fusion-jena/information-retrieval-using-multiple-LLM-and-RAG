was analysed using various evaluation matrices. During model training, 
the input image size was set to 512 × 512 and the maximum batch size 
was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to 
follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. The 
models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer 
with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, with

where,  n  represents  the  input  tensor  with  shape  [batch_size,  height, 
width, channels].  It contains the input  data or feature map  used in a 
neural network, w(n) is a weight tensor derived from n, typically ob-
tained through some form of learned parameters or coefficients, and f (w 
(n), n) represents the process of treating the input feature n. 

The network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 is shown in 
Fig. 10. Unlike other attention mechanisms that are usually introduced 
earlier in the network and trained along with the other layers, the depth- 
attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the 
detection model. It remains unchanged and does not adapt during the 
training  process.  This means that the depth-attention  weights are not 
updated  during  training  and  remain  fixed  throughout  the  learning

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text only mentions details about the model training, such as the input image size, batch size, and optimization methods used. There is no mention of any specific code repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the location of the code repository.
