value of fish is rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 indicates the best 
freshness quality, and1 denotes the worst. For instance, the best fresh-
ness  quality of the  eye is  characterized by convexity, clear  and shiny 
cornea and pupil, specific for fish species. The lowest quality is char-
acterized  by  a  very  concave  appearance,  a  very  cloudy  cornea,  gray 
pupils, and a lack of shine. The examination process involves observing 
the eyes, clear observation of the removed gills, confirming body mucus 
by touching the skin surface, dissecting the body to observe the meat, 
inhaling gases emitted by the body of the fish, and touching the meat 
surface to assess its texture (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). Fish that have undergone

2.9. Metric performance 

We evaluate the determination of the number of cluster by K-Means 
using  Distortion,  Silhouette,  and  Calinski-Harabasz.  Distortion  calcu-
lates the sum of squared distances of data to their nearest cluster center 
(Rousseeuw,  1987).  The  lower  Distortion  indicates  that  the  achieved 
cluster cohesiveness is good. Distortion is calculated as follows: 

Distortion =

Each  point's  silhouette  value  represents  how  similar  it  is  to  other 
points in the same cluster, as opposed to other points in different clusters 
(Rousseeuw, 1987). The Silhouette index is calculated as follows: 

Si =

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

ranging  from  2  to  10  clusters,  using  the  Euclidean  distance  as  a 
dissimilarity  metric.  Evaluations  were  performed  with  Distortion, 
Silhouette,  and  Calinski-Harabasz  in  each  clustering  calculation. 
Distortion evaluation involved calculating the sum of squared distances 
from each day to the assigned centroid of K-Means. Silhouette computed 
the average Silhouette coefficient of all days, while Calinski-Harabasz 
determined the ratio of dispersion between and within clusters. These 
stages were carried out for seven species: Chanos Chanos, Oreochromis

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any deep learning models or their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it discusses three metrics used to evaluate the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm: Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz. Distortion measures the sum of squared distances of data to their nearest cluster centers, indicating the goodness of cluster cohesion. A lower distortion score suggests better cluster cohesiveness. The Silhouette index computes the similarity of each point to others in the same cluster compared to those in different clusters. Lastly, the Calinski-Harabasz index determines the ratio of dispersion between and within clusters.
