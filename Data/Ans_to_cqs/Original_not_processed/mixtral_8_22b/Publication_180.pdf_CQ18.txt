We  calibrated  our  models  for  Mexican  and  Brazilian  spe-
cies  using  different  numbers  of  training  steps,  and  considered  two 
factors  to  find  optima  for  training TensorFlow  (Fig.  2):  1)  correct 
identification rate, which improved up to a certain point, but then 
reached  a  plateau,  beyond  which  we  saw  no  significant  improve-
ment,  and  2)  processing  time  (in  hours),  which  showed  a  positive 
linear relationship with number of training steps. For the Mexican 
dataset, with 12 species, 2,000 emerged as an optimum number of 
training steps, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate 
(Fig. 2); the largest gap between the processing time trace and iden-
tification  rate  occurred  following  this  number  of  steps. Above  this 
number of training steps, subtle improvements in identification rate

were possible (up to 83.1%), but processing time was significantly 
longer  (7  h  instead  of  3.5  h).  Based  on  the  same  logic,  we  chose 
12,000 training steps as an optimum number for Brazilian species, at 
which we achieved an 86.7% overall identification rate (Fig. 2). The 
Brazilian data set had a plateau that was more obvious: overall iden-
tification rate barely reached a maximum 87.0%, yet processing time 
increased  from  30  to  80  h.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  amount  of 
time discussed above is only for training TensorFlow over all images 
in the reference library with multiple replicate analyses; for identifi-
cation of a single image, it only takes a few seconds.

Helpful Answer:
The authors monitored the model performance during training by considering two factors: 1) correct identification rate and 2) processing time. They trained their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps and observed how these factors changed with increasing training steps. For the Mexican dataset, they found that the correct identification rate improved up to a certain point before reaching a plateau, while processing time increased linearly with the number of training steps. By analyzing these trends, they determined that 2,000 training steps were optimal for achieving an 83.0% overall identification rate without excessively long processing times. Similarly, for the Brazilian dataset, they identified 12,000 training steps as optimal based on the tradeoff between correct identification rate and processing time. This approach allowed them to balance accuracy and efficiency when monitoring the model performance during training.
