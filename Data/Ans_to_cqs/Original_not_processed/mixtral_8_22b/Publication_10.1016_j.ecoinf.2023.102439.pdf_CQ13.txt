2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

By employing the W-ANN model, the training values reached 96% 
for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the estimated percentages for all 
data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The 
developed hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 
18.7%  in  Iznik  and  7.3%  in  Alanya,  as  determined  by  the  network’s 
performance.  These  findings  highlight  the  hybrid  model’s  enhanced 
predictive capabilities and effectiveness in both study areas.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the model uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a NARX feedback structure. It also mentions that the input layer consists of three processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters, while the EVI data was used as the output layer. Additionally, the context discusses the importance of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer to achieve the best results. Therefore, while we cannot provide exact details regarding the learning rate or optimizer, we can confirm that the model involves tuning the number of neurons in the hidden layer as one of its hyperparameters.
