Deep learning tools for bat acoustic signal detection

S1 Fig. CNNFAST network architecture description. The CNNFAST network consists of two
convolution layers (Conv1 and Conv2), with 16 filters each (shown in yellow, with the filter
size shown inset). Both convolution layers are followed by a max pooling layer (Max Pool1 and
Max Pool2), and the network ends with a fully connected layer with 64 units (Fully Connect).
CNNFAST computes feature maps (shown as white boxes) across the entire input spectrogram,
resulting in less computation and a much faster run time. The fully connected layer is also eval-
uated as a convolution. The output of the detector is a probability vector (shown in green)
whose length is one quarter times the width of the input spectrogram. The numbers below
each layer indicate the height, weight, and depth of the corresponding layer.

binary classification problem. Our CNNFULL consisted of three convolution and max pooling
layers, followed by one fully connected layer (see Supplementary Information Methods for fur-
ther details). We halved the size of the input spectrogram to reduce the input dimensionality
to the CNN which resulted in an input array of size of 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps, cor-
responding to a fixed length, detection window size of 23ms. We applied the CNN in a sliding
window fashion, to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in
the spectrogram (Fig 1D). As passive acoustic monitoring can generate large quantities of data,
we required a detection algorithm that would run faster than real time. While CNNs produce
state of the art results for many tasks, na√Øve application of them for detection problems at test
time can be extremely computationally inefficient [33]. So, to increase the speed of our system

CNNFULL, CNNFAST, Random Forest, and the Segmentation algorithms took 53, 9.5, 11,
and 17 seconds respectively, to run the full detection pipeline on the 3.2 minutes of full spec-
trum iBats Romania and Bulgaria test dataset. Compared to CNNFULL there was therefore a
significant decrease in the time required to perform detection using CNNFAST, which was also
the fastest of our methods overall. Notably, close to 50% of the CNN runtime was spent gener-
ating the spectrograms for detection, making this the most computationally expensive stage in
the pipeline.

Ecological monitoring application results

mation S3 Fig). From this we randomly selected a training set of 2,812 clips, consisting of
4,782 individual search-phase echolocation call annotations from Romania and Bulgaria, with
which to train the CNNs (corresponding to data from 347 road-transect sampling events of
137 different transects collected between 2006 and 2011) (Fig 2A). Data were chosen from
these countries as they contain the majority of the most commonly occurring bat species in
Europe [41]. This training set was used for all experiments. The remaining annotated clips
from the same user were used to create one of our test sets, iBats Romania and Bulgaria (Fig
2A and see below). Occasionally, call harmonics and the associated main call were sometimes
labelled with different start times in the same audio clip. To address this problem, we auto-
matically merged annotations that occurred within 6 milliseconds of each other, making the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the training set used for the experiments included data from 347 road-transect sampling events of 137 different transects collected between 2006 and 2011 in Romania and Bulgaria. However, it does not provide any information about the availability or location of the data repository. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
