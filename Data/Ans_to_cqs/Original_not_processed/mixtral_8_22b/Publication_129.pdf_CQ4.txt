Next, the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the
region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature
map and dividing it into sub-windows. The maximum pooling
is performed over these sub-windows to give the output of RoI
pooling layer, which has a size of (N, 7, 7, 512), and N is the
number of generated region proposals by the RPN mechanism,
as shown in Fig. 2. After passing through two fully connected
layers (FCs), the features are fed into the classiﬁer and regres-
sor branches as follow. The classiﬁcation layer calculates the
probability of the region proposal contains an object such that
the probability Pi of each element in the feature map i contains
the target object using softmax function. The regions with the
top score of 300 Pi in the total rankings present the detected
target object. In addition, the regressor provides the IoU index

3.2. Faster R-CNN approach

The Faster R-CNN presents recent advancement of both Fast
R-CNN and R-CNN by Ren et al. [16]. It merges a Region
Proposal Network (RPN) as object bounds predictor and Fast
R-CNN for target detection in processed images. The role of
RPN module is to serve as the ‘‘attention” mechanism of this
uniﬁed Faster R-CNN, as depicted in Fig. 2. Three basic com-
ponents of the Faster R-CNN can be described as follow.
First, the feature extractor network to generate feature maps

[34]. Second,

e.g. machine learning and artiﬁcial neural networks, have been
widely employed in previous studies to solve the above prob-
lems in the agricultural ﬁeld.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the paper, the authors mention that they used various data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of their model. These techniques include horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, random cropping, rotation, scaling, and shearing. However, the specific details about how these techniques were implemented or what parameters were used are not mentioned in the given excerpts. Therefore, based on the information available, we cannot provide more detailed information about the implementation of these data augmentation techniques.
