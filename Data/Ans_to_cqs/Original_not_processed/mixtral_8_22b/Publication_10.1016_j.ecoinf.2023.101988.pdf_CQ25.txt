%Query
Query: "What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the title of their work ("Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning"), it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for classifying or identifying different species of animals based on their vocalizations. This would help researchers monitor and study animal biodiversity more effectively.

Unhelpful Answer: I don't have enough information to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
