4. Choice of training-testing set distribution:

Train: 80%, Test: 20%,
Train: 60%, Test: 40%,
Train: 50%, Test: 50%,
Train: 40%, Test: 60%,
Train: 20%, Test: 80%.

• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

Computer vision, and object recognition in particular,
has made tremendous advances in the past few years. The
PASCAL VOC Challenge (Everingham et al., 2010), and more
recently the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)
(Russakovsky et al., 2015) based on the ImageNet dataset (Deng
et al., 2009) have been widely used as benchmarks for numerous
visualization-related problems in computer vision,
including
object classiﬁcation. In 2012, a large, deep convolutional neural
network achieved a top-5 error of 16.4% for the classiﬁcation
of images into 1000 possible categories (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
In the following 3 years, various advances in deep convolutional
neural networks lowered the error rate to 3.57% (Krizhevsky
et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014; Zeiler and Fergus,
2014; He et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2015). While training large
neural networks can be very time-consuming, the trained models
can classify images very quickly, which makes them also suitable

Helpful Answer:
The study uses three types of datasets: color, grayscale, and leaf segmented. However, the specific names or sources of these datasets are not mentioned in the provided information. It only mentions the use of the PlantVillage dataset in one of the experiments, but no further details about this dataset are provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of all the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
