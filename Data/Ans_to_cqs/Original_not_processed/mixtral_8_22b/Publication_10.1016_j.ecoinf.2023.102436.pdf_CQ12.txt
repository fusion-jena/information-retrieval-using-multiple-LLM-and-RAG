and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the 
automatic  recognition  of  woody  regrowth  vegetation  in  repeat  land-
scape  photographs. By comparing  the changes between repeat  photo-
graphs, planners and designers can identify general trends of landscape 
change.  Although  these  image-based  methods  are  powerful  tools  to 
assess and track landscape visual quality, design projects’ aesthetic and 
scientific meaning may be transformed or lost during the modification 
and  application  process  in  the  widely  used  visualization  tools,  like 
Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max (Urech et al., 2020). Moreover, image- 
based  methods  fail  to  capture  or  represent  some  spatial attributes  (e. 
g.,  volumes),  which  is  also  a  key  component  within  the  landscape 
composition. Extracting and representing spatial attributes from the 3D

Helpful Answer:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. This method allows planners and designers to compare changes between repeat photographs and identify general trends of landscape change. However, it should be noted that while image-based methods such as this one are powerful tools for assessing and tracking landscape visual quality, they may not fully capture or represent certain spatial attributes, such as volumes, which are important components within landscape composition. Additionally, the use of widely used visualization tools like Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max may transform or lose the aesthetic and scientific meaning of design projects during the modification and application process.
