On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

(of 94.5%) using the deep learning–based CNN model. Martin-Abadal 
et  al.  (Martin-Abadal  et  al.,  2018)  estimated  seagrass  meadows  by 
applying  an  encoder  decoder-based  model  (VGG16FCN8).  They  ach-

Meanwhile,  Weidmann et  al.  (Weidmann et  al., 2019) found  that the

compared  to  the  fully  convolutional  networks,  dilated  convolution 
networks (dilNets) and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset.

A  novel  compound  scaling  method  was  proposed  in  EfficientNet, 
which  uses  a  compound  coefficient  ϕ  to  scale  uniformly  and  adjust 
dynamically three parameters’  depth α, width β  and resolution γ  in a 
principled way: 

depth : d = αϕ
width : w = βϕ
resolution : r = γϕ
s.t. α.β2.γ2 ≈ 2 α ≥ 1, β ≥ 1, γ ≥ 1.

where constant α, β and γ is determined by the grid search operation. 
User-specified coefficient ϕ  controls the available resources for model 
scaling, while constant α, β and γ identify the way to assign these extra 
resources to network width, depth and resolution, respectively. 

3. Methodology 

The procedure of the proposed approach for H. ovalis detection can 
be divided into four steps: dataset description; dataset processing and 
labelling; model training; and performance evaluation. These steps are
