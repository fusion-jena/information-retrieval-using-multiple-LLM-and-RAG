The river runoff variation given in Fig. 8(a) shows a decrease in the 
volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3  to 700 Mm3, which means 
that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth. 
Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which 
can generally be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are 
related  to  human  activities,  which  include  excessive  use  of  water  re-
sources, excessive development of agriculture around the lake, and the 
structures built in the basin. One of the human activities is changing the 
cultivation  pattern  and  creating  unconventional  deep  wells  in  the  re-
gion, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of 
water-based  agricultural  products  increased  from  350,000  ha  to 
500,000 ha. The construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the 
catchment  water  of  the  lake,  which,  with  these  unplanned  dams  and

By comparing the results obtained in the Sections 3.1 to 3.3, it could 
be  deduced  that  the  climate  change  and  occurrence  of  drought  had 
negative effects on the drying up of the lake, so that in dry years such as 
2014 and 2015, the condition of the lake was worse. However, the effect 
of climate change was not enough to explain the dramatic water loss of 
the lake. The study of land use changes in the basin showed that human 
activities are important reasons for the lake’s shrinkage. For example, 
increasing  the  number  of  crops  that  use  too  much  water,  especially 
water-based products led to the need for water resources in the basin. 
Also, the crops extensively change to many water-used crops. In addition 
to using the dam’s water for agriculture, deep and semi-deep wells were 
developed for increasing crops. The cumulative effect of such human- 
induced  interventions  has  been  demonstrated  as  the  main  reason  for

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, encouraging simpler models with better generalization capabilities. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during each iteration of training. This forces the network to distribute the learned information across all neurons rather than depending heavily on specific ones. By doing so, dropout effectively creates an ensemble of smaller networks within the original network, improving its ability to generalize.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of the regularization can be controlled by adjusting the regularization parameter, which determines how much emphasis is placed on minimizing the size of the weights compared to minimizing the error on the training set.

In summary, regularization methods like Dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by introducing penalties to the loss function during optimization. These penalties encourage simpler models with improved generalization capabilities, allowing them to perform better on new, unseen data.
