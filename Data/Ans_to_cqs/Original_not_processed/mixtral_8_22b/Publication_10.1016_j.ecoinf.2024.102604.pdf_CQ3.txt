on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

(GAM)  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2003),  machine  learning  methods  such  as 
Random  Forests  (RF)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019),  Boosted  Regression  Trees 
(BRT) (Hellegers et al., 2020) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) (Phillips 
et al., 2006) are gaining popularity. Among these, Maxent, which uses 
only presence data, has become a widely used SDM because of its su-
perior predictive ability (Wisz et al., 2008), particularly given the dif-
ficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Other techniques may also be used depending on the specific application and requirements of the deep learning model being developed.

Based on the context provided, it appears that the authors did not explicitly discuss the use of any particular data annotation technique for their research. Instead, they focused primarily on discussing various modeling approaches for species distribution models (SDMs), including generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), random forests (RFs), boosted regression trees (BRTs), and maximum entropy (Maxent) models. These models were applied to analyze patterns of plant diversity across different spatial scales using environmental variables and other relevant factors. The authors emphasize the importance of correcting sampling biases in environmental spaces when developing SDMs, but do not specifically mention any data annotation techniques used in their analysis.
