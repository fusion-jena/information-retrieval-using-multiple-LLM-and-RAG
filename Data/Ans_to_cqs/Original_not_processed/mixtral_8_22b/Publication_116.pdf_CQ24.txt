1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

2) Unbiased Dataset: For each species X in dataset D, we
tried to approximate a 70%-30% distribution as in the Biased
Dataset case. However, in order to avoid the SSPB, we used
the unique specimen identiﬁer to place images from the same
specimen in eiher the training dataset or the testing dataset.
This restriction alone could not be achievable if, for example,
one species X has photos of several leaves but they are all
from the same specimen. Our dataset D was created so that it
precludes such scenario, as there are photos from at least two
different specimens for each species X in dataset D. However,
this restriction clearly makes it harder to approximate the ideal
70%-30% distribution both, at the species level and globally.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results across different runs of the model. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different initializations and average the results to reduce variance due to random initialization. Additionally, techniques like batch normalization and dropout can help regularize the network and improve generalization performance. In terms of handling randomness during data splitting into training and test sets, stratified sampling can be used to maintain the original class proportions in both datasets. The biased dataset mentioned in the context uses a simple random split, while the unbiased dataset employs a more sophisticated method involving unique specimen identifiers to ensure that images from the same specimen do not appear in both training and test sets.
