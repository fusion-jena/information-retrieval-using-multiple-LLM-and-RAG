ture dataset from Lake Victoria. Sierra et al. (2017) investigated FDA 
methods to examine particle-size distributions in a beach/shallow ma-
rine  sedimentary  environment in  Gij´on  Bay (NW Spain). Acar-Denizli 
et  al.  (2018)  applied  a  functional  linear  regression  model  to  remote 
sensing data, enabling them to predict total suspended solids concen-
tration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary. Tarro-Saavedra 
et al. (2020) classified the seabed in coastal environments by employing 
FDA approaches on acoustic curves. Godard (2021) employed FDA to 
study  high-frequency  physical,  biological,  and  behavioral  data  from 
electronic recorders deployed on marine predators, particularly south-
ern elephant seals. Nonparametric functional spatial regression has been 
explored for mapping the presence of demersal coastal fish from Senegal 
in studies by Ndiaye et al. (2022, 2020). Yarger et al. (2022) utilized a

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform was used based solely on this information.
