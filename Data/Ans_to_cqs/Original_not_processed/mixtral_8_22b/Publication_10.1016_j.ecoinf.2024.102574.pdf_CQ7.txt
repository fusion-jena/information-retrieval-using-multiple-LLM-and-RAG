Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, a larger portion of the data is allocated for training (e.g., 70-80%), while smaller portions are reserved for testing (e.g., 10-15%) and validation (e.g., 10-15%). Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation may also be employed to ensure robustness and generalizability of the trained model.
