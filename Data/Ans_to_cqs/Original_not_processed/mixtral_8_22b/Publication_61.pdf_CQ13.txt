Training a neural network requires to set several hyper-parameters
such as the learning rate, number of epochs and batch size. The learning
rate is a special one since it deﬁnes how much the weights are ‘moved’
to decrease the loss. A bigger one could cause the network not to learn,
on the other hand, a smaller one could require much more steps for
learning. To decrease this issue, we train the network with Adam op-
timizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015), a variant of the stochastic gradient
optimization where the learning rate is adjusted automatically. The rest
of the parameters are set empirically, more details are presented in the
experiments section.

5. Experiments

In this section, we present the experimental characterization of the
proposed approach. The implemented network was trained with Adam
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) on a Inter Core i7 machine with
NVIDIA GeForce 1080 GPU. The hyperparameters were set as follows:
learning rate 0.01, number of epochs 150, batch size 2500.

max pooling operation is performed, using a kernel of 2 × 2 and stride
two. Next, the features are ﬂattened to a one dimension vector of size
400. Later, three fully connected layers are applied with 120, 84, and 2
nodes respectively. Until this point, the output of the CNN is a vector of
real numbers called logits. Therefore, a LogSoftMax function is applied
to convert the logits into a normalized probability distribution:

5.4. Dataset extension

The proposed approach has shown good performance (accuracy) for
cactus recognition in aerial images. One way to improve the current
accuracy could be to make deeper the current CNN, however, im-
proving the accuracy with a deeper network will tend to memorize the
dataset due to the model capacity (Goodfellow et al., 2016), causing
model overﬁtting. A better improvement to the current work is to in-
clude more examples in the dataset. Such examples should be obtained
under diﬀerent conditions, some variations are diﬀerent daylight con-
ditions or diﬀerent year seasons. Diﬀerent season pictures will provide
a distinctive context because the rainy season changes all valley's ve-
getation.

6. Conclusions

5.1. Data augmentation accuracy

A common practice to improve the accuracy of a deep learning
model is to do data augmentation. In this section, we compare the ac-
curacy of the network when data augmentation is included during
training. The compared training variations are the following:

(cid:129) No augmentation. The patches only are resized to 32 × 32 and

normalized.
