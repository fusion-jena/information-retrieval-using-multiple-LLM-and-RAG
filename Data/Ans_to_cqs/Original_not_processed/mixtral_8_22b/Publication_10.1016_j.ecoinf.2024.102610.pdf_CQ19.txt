those conditions (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). We 
expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

abundance  of  Aedes  aegypti  female  mosquitoes  in  Thailand.  For  tick 
abundance in Southern Scandinavia, Jung Kjær et al. (2019) employed 
Boosted  Regression  Trees  (BRT)  with  gridded  environmental  and 
weather  variables.  Their  approach  yielded  higher  accuracy  for  tick 
larvae and nymphs (R2 of 0.69) but less accurate results for adult ticks 
(R2 of 0.1). Ceia-Hasse et al. (2023) demonstrated an improved perfor-
mance  of  deep  learning  over  classical  machine  learning  (area  under 
curve values 0.83 and 0.75 respectively) in predicting the abundance of 
yellow  fever  mosquitoes  in  Madeira,  Portugal.  These  findings  collec-
tively  highlight  the  promising  potential  of  various  machine  learning 
techniques in developing high-performing models for assessing disease 
vector abundance.
