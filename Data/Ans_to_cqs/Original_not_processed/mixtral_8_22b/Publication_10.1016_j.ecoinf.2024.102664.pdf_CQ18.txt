All the collected data is divided into three parts: data from 2003 to 
2020 for training, 2021 data for validation, and 2022 data for testing. 
We  determine  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the  model  by 
assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts using data from 
points  A,  B,  and  C.  The  structure  of  all  models,  including  hyper-
parameters such as kernel size and number of nodes, is determined using 
a method that controls variables. This involves keeping other variables 
constant and selecting the parameters that optimize the validation data 
forecast results as the model’s hyperparameters. Table 1 illustrates the 
adjustment process of the solver for training the network and the input 
time  series  length  for  all  models.  In  the  vast  majority  of  cases,  when 
using  Adam  as  the  solver  for  training  the  network,  the  RMSE  of  the 
validation data forecasting results is lower. Adam combines the benefits

Algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022 were evalu-
ated using various deep learning models, as summarized in Table 3. The 
hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  demonstrated 
superior  performance 
throughout  the  year,  achieving  the  highest  values  for  POD  and  HSS 
compared to other models. Notably, the LSTM model outperformed the 
CNN model. The Zhoushan fishery exhibits pronounced seasonal varia-
tion in algal blooms, with the highest occurrence in summer, totaling 
8468 bloom days, followed by Spring with 4720 bloom days. Among all 
seasonal forecasts, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved 
the  highest  HSS  values.  Specifically,  during  the  peak  algal  bloom 
occurrence in summer, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model excelled with both 
POD and HSS at 0.32. In contrast, during winter and autumn, the hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model displayed lower HSS values, primarily due to elevated 
FAR.  Across  all  model  forecasts  and  seasonal  variations,  the  POCR

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, a specific strategy was employed. All the collected data was divided into three distinct sets: data spanning from 2003 to 2020 was used for training purposes, while data from 2021 served as validation data, and data from 2022 was reserved for testing. To assess the efficacy of the validation data forecasts, points A, B, and C were utilized. The structure of all models, along with their respective hyperparameters like kernel size and number of nodes, was established through a controlled variable approach. This entailed maintaining constant other variables and choosing those parameters that yielded optimal validation data forecast outcomes as the model's hyperparameters. Furthermore, it was observed that employing Adam as the solver for training the network generally resulted in a lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the validation data forecasting results.
