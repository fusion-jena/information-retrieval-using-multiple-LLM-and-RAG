are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will

Extending Fletcher et al., there are also options to use dataset specific 
weights  or  factor  interactions  to  account  for  differences  in  included 
datasets  (Leung  et  al.,  2019).  All  these  types  of  integration  are  also 
supported for inference on single datasets or can be used in sequential 
estimation. For example a potential use case easily enabled by ibis.iSDM 
could be to first fit a model using one biodiversity data source and a 
specific set of covariates such as broad climatic data, and then use the 
output of the resulting prediction as an offset to estimate the distribution 
with a different biodiversity or covariate data. Lastly, integration is also 
possibly through a dedicated model that combines multiple presence- 
only and presence-absence datasets together through a joint likelihood 
in a Bayesian setting (Fithian et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2019; Koshkina

Isaac et al. (2020). This is since (a) the consideration of all available data 
is  one of the  main points of  model-based integration, (b)  appropriate 
validation metrics are less straight-forward than for single datasets as 
biases and sampling methods can differ, and (c) any validation dataset 
might not represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated 
by  the  integrated  model.  For  example,  the  standard  practice  of  with-
holding parts of the training data for validating a model often means that 
both  training  and  testing  data  suffer  from  the  same  spatial  and  envi-
ronmental biases (Baker et al., 2022). If, however prior knowledge of the 
biology of a species is integrated in a SDM through a prior or offset, thus 
“nudging”  or constraining response functions towards a more sensible 
outcome  and  ultimately  different  prediction,  the  use  of  any  (biased) 
withheld data would likely indicate a reduced predictive performance

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias specifically during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several approaches relevant to handling biases in biodiversity datasets when fitting species distribution models (SDMs), which could potentially be applied during preprocessing.

One approach mentioned is using dataset-specific weights or factor interactions to account for differences in included datasets. This technique might help mitigate biases arising from variations in data sources or collection methods. Additionally, the text suggests integrating prior knowledge of a species' biology into SDMs through priors or offsets, effectively "nudging" response functions toward more realistic outcomes. While this method doesn't directly address data bias, it may indirectly improve predictions by accounting for known biological factors.

Although not explicitly stated, stratified splitting – dividing data based on class labels to ensure equal representation in training and test sets – could be employed to handle imbalanced classes within biodiversity datasets. Similarly, oversampling or undersampling techniques might be utilized to balance the number of instances between classes, reducing potential biases caused by uneven distributions.

Lastly, the importance of diverse data collection is emphasized, as the text mentions that considering all available data is one of the primary goals of model-based integration. By incorporating various data sources and types, researchers can minimize biases stemming from overreliance on limited or homogeneous datasets.
