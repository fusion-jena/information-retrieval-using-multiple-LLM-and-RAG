similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

An  850-ms  long  data  segment  (boxes)  is  extracted 
from the unfiltered waveform around each detection 
to  form  a  frequency-reassigned  spectrogram  image. 
These  images  are  fed  into  ResNet-50  CNN,  and  acti-
vations  from  the  fully  connected  layer  (fc1000)  are 
used as a feature vector for each detected signal. The 
SVM  classifier  is  used  to  classify  the  candidate  de-
tections based on the layer activations. Signals in the 
‘other’  class  represent  false  alarms  identified  by

Based on these activations, a one vs. all support vector machine (SVM) 
classifier  is  then  used  to  identify  the  optimal  decision  boundary  to 
differentiate ‘boatwhistles' from ‘other’ signals within the feature space

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing datasets. For model selection and parameter optimization, 50% of the training data were held out for validation. This means that the initial 70% of the labeled dataset was further divided into two parts - 50% for actual training and 50% for validation. The remaining 30% of the labeled dataset was used for testing the performance of the final model.
