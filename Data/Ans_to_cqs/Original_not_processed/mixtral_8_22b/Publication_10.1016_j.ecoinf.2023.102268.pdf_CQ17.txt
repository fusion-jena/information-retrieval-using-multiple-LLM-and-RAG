similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

extracted  automatically  using  the  activations  from  ResNet-50's  deep, 
fully connected layer fc1000, located just before its classification layer. 
Based on these activations, a one vs. all support vector machine (SVM) 
classifier  is  then  used  to  identify  the  optimal  decision  boundary  to 
differentiate ‘boatwhistles' from ‘other’ signals within the feature space 
(Fig.  6)  (e.g.,  Kecman,  2005).  Using  a  pre-trained  deep  CNN  with  an 
SVM is a form of transfer learning (e.g., Bousetouane and Morris, 2015; 
Halberstadt, 2020), and the workflow mirrors that used by Bohnenstiehl

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined what regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization, were employed in this case.
