5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  auto  encoders  and  generative 
adversarial  networks  (GAN),  and  are  better  at  learning  sophisticated 
patterns in data but can be more computationally expensive and require 
more data to train (Endres et al., 2022).

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python package. It also discusses classical and deep learning methods for generating synthetic data, mentioning examples such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for deep learning methods, and regression, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines for classical machine learning methods. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
