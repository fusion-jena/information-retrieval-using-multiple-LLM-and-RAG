Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to images or other types of input data. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the dataset. For more details about these techniques, please refer to relevant sources such as Gavrilov et al. (2012), which is cited in the context but not directly related to data augmentation.
