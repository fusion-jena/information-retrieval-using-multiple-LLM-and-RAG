comprehensive datasets and in-depth research employing machine and 
deep  learning  techniques.  These  challenges  stem  from  the  need  to

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

2.3.3. Transformation 

Two fundamental techniques employed in the data transformation 
process  are  the  MinMaxScaler  and  the  LabelEncoder.  The  former  is 
especially  crucial  for  algorithms  that  are  sensitive  to  the  scale  of  the 
data, such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and neural networks. The 
LabelEncoder was applied to transform categorical fields into numerical 
values. Agricultural datasets often include categorical data, such as soil 
types  or  crop  varieties,  which  must  be  encoded  to  numerical  labels 
before being fed into machine learning algorithms.

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the utilization of comprehensive datasets, suggesting that these could have been obtained through various means such as surveys, sensors, or even public datasets. In general, agricultural data collection can involve diverse sources like satellite imagery, weather stations, drones, IoT devices, and manual field observations. Nonetheless, without further details, it remains unclear what exact methods were employed in this particular case.
