Description and Parameters

Finally, to simplify the parameters setup of each present method, a 
user-defined  data  type  paradigm  has  been  implemented  by  using 
enumeration classes. An enumeration is a special class that represents a 
group  of  symbolic  names  bound  to  unique,  constant  values  (i.e.,  un-
changeable variables). For example, the Products enum class represents a 
collection of available product names in the service. The Bands class is a 
composition of enumeration bands classes available for each product. 
Table 1 shows the methods exposed by the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider 
with the input parameters type.

execute_all() method, by which a user can get all available data in the 
NASA server for a given product and location. The call of the methods 
execute_many,  execute_all,  and  their  respective  asynchronous  versions, 

According to the NASA specification, there is a limit of a maximum of 
ten dates per request. In order to avoid this limitation, the execute_many 
() method has been implemented. The execute_many() accepts the same 

async_execute_many and async_execute_all is reported in Listings 3 and 4.

input  parameters  of  the  subset()  method,  but  returns  a  lazy  iterator. 
When  nasawebservice  has  to  deal  with  large  volume  of  requests,  the 
choice to use an iterator improves the memory management for the data 
ingestion  operations.  The  same  approach  has  been  pursued  in  the

chosen between text/csv (i.e., comma-separated values) or application/ 
json format, following the common MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions) types guidelines (Ned and Borenstein, 1996). A more com-
plete and detailed review of Global Subset methods can be found on the 
Open API documentation page of the web service. On the contrary, the 
Fixed  Sites  APIs  interface,  not  implemented  in  the  current  version  of 
nasawebservice,  provides  data  for  selected  fields  and  flux  towers, 
belonging to a certain research network (e.g., FLUXNET Canada), across 
the world.
