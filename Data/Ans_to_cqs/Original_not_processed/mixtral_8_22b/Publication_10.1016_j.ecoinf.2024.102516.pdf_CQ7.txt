Fig. 4. The basic 3-phase processing pipeline for training our network. In the first phase, a classification network is trained using GBIF image data, which applies 
class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps. In the second phase, these maps are used for training a segmentation network on the GBIF image data. 
In the third phase, the networks weights can be used to either train a plant cover prediction network on the actual vegetation data (like the InsectArmageddon 
dataset), or the network can be applied directly to vegetation data to generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations. Image adapted

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified split based on class labels when dealing with supervised learning tasks like classification or semantic segmentation. This ensures that each set has roughly the same distribution of classes. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set (around 70-80%), validation set (around 10-15%), and test set (around 10-15%). The training set is used to optimize the model parameters, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set evaluates the final performance of the fully trained model.
