2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used by the authors. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a direct answer to this query. It might be helpful to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more detailed information regarding their dataset and its availability.
