Note: Ground truth means the actual number of tree species in the ﬁeld survey, and prediction denotes the predicted
number of tree species by our solution.

represent the Margalef index at 10 and 20 m scales, respectively. SW_10m and SW_20m are for the
Shannon–Wiener index at 10 and 20 m scales, respectively.

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter optimization based solely on this context.
