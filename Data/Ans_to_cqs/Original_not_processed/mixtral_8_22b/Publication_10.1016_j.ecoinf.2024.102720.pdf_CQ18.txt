After the reliability and validity analysis, the fitness of the model fit
was tested using the data. To test the fitness of the model, we chose the
most commonly used model fit metrics where χ2/df represents the chi-
square value after considering the model complexity of 2.975, GFI
represents the goodness-of-fit index of 0.944, RMSEA represents the
approximate root-mean-square error of 0.089, the RMR indicates root
mean square deviation from 0.002, CFI indicates comparative goodness-
of-fit index of 0.913, NFI represents a normal goodness-of-fit index of
0.915, TLI indicates a standardized fit coefficient of 0.912, and IFI
represents a growth fit index of 0.929. All statistics exceeded the critical
value of 0.9 (Steiger and Vancouver, 1990) and met the criteria for
model fit with a high degree of goodness of fit, thus indicating an overall
fit of the SEM to the data.

We observed (Table 6) that the model provided in this study matches

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the researchers have evaluated the model's performance by testing its fitness using various common model fit metrics such as Chi-square value, Goodness-of-fit Index (GFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normal Fit Index (NFI), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI), and Cronbach alpha. These indices were used to assess the overall fit of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to the data. Based on these evaluations, it was concluded that the model had a high degree of goodness of fit and matched well with the given data.
