DNN  are  algorithms  consisting  of  neurons  arranged  in  successive 
layers that apply computations based on learnable parameters (weights 
and  bias)  and  activation  functions  to  inputs  from  previous  layers, 
through to an output consistent with the training data. Different types of 
layers  (convolutional,  pooling,  flatten,  etc.)  may  combine  in  large 
numbers to create complex algorithms that are difficult to interpret and 
often referred to as ‘black boxes’ (McGinn et al., 2023; Stowell, 2022). It 
is virtually impossible to follow how they use millions of parameters to 
reach a particular decision for any given input. Consequently, there is an 

array of tools and procedures to try to understand some of their inner 
workings. Here, we focus on the improved utilisation of one technique 
referred to as “analysis of embeddings”.

end of the file. In those cases the extract would have a random start that 
would encompass the whole of the labelled section. In addition, about a 
quarter of the sound files in the NIPS4Bplus are shorter than 3 s, for these 
we used the whole length of the file and padded the end with zeros.

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that techniques like padding short audio clips with zeros or using the entire length of the clip when dealing with sounds shorter than 3 seconds could help mitigate potential issues caused by randomness. These methods ensure consistency in the input size, which might indirectly address concerns related to variability introduced by random seeds. Nonetheless, directly addressing the management of random seed values requires specific knowledge beyond what is presented in the provided context.
