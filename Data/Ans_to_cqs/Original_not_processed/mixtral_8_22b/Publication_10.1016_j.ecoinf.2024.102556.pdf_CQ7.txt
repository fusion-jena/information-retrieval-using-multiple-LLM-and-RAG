As  the  dataset  in  this  study  is  self-defined  and  contains  only  one 
category,  challenges  arise  during  model  training,  including  concerns 
about  overfitting,  the  inability  to  assess  the  model’s  generalization 
ability,  and  uneven  data  distribution  affecting  prediction  rates.  To 
address these issues, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k- 
fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, whereas the 
remaining  four  subsets  constituted  the  training  set.  The  YOLOv7 
detection  model  underwent  five  rounds  of  training  and  validation  to 
assess  its  generalizability.  Fig.  10  depicts  the  accuracy  curve  graph 
resulting from the 5-fold cross-validation model. This reveals that the 
five  YOLOv7  models  optimally  used  all  the  samples  in  the  dataset, 
ensuring  that  each  sample  was  trained  and  validated  in  a  different 
subset. This approach yielded a prediction rate closer to 1. However, the

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

Helpful Answer:
The dataset in this study was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, while the remaining four subsets constituted the training set. The YOLOv7 detection model underwent five rounds of training and validation to assess its generalizability. This approach ensured that each sample was trained and validated in a different subset, which helped avoid overfitting and allowed for better assessment of the model's ability to generalize.

In machine learning and deep learning, datasets are often split into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the neural network based on the error between predicted and actual values. The testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model after training, providing an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data. Finally, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It helps ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.

Cross-validation is a technique used to improve the reliability of the results obtained from a statistical analysis. K-fold cross-validation involves randomly dividing the dataset into 'k' equal-sized subsamples or folds. One fold is retained as the validation set, while the other 'k - 1' folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The average performance across all 'k' trials is then calculated. This method reduces bias and variance, making it a popular choice for evaluating machine learning algorithms.
