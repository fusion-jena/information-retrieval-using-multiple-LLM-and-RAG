%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it would be best to refer to the original research paper by S.K. Sain et al. published in Ecological Informatics volume 81 in 2024 with article number 1026488 for more details on the dataset used in their study.
