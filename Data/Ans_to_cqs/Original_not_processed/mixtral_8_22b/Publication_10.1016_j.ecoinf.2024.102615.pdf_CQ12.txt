2.4.2. Performance metrics and interpretation method of the model 

This  study  uses  the  correlation  coefficient  (R),  root  mean  square 
error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) coefficient of determination 
(R2), and mean relative error (MAE) metrics to confirm the prediction 
performance of the model on the validation set. R measures the linear 
relationship between two variables. Its value varies between (cid:0) 1 and 1, 
such that values closer to 0 denote a lesser correlation between the two 
variables,  indicating  improved  model  performance.  The  formula  for 
calculating R is as follows (Qi et al., 2018):

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors are using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. This can be inferred from the table titled "Optimal MLP Architecture and Parameters" where each layer of the model is described along with its respective size. Additionally, the use of dense layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers further supports this conclusion. However, there is no mention of any other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the authors are using an MLP model in their pipeline.
