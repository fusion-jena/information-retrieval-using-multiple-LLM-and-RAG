3.3. Training procedure

Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  deep  learning  techniques  to  pre-
processing under extreme conditions such as low light, extreme occlu-
sion, or overlapping of fish can address unique challenges by tailoring 
datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these 
datasets. Incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe (Abualigah et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2020) embeddings could enhance the detection and 
classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and 
semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass esti-
mates. Continuing to modify the architecture of deep learning models 
like YOLO, to better suit specific requirements, includes altering various 
parts of the architecture as needed to handle different environmental 
factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform was used for deployment.
