3.5.3. Artificial neural network 

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. 

3.6. Model fitting and evaluation

The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to train the model, where the model learns patterns and relationships between features and target variables. The validation set is used during the training process to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The testing set is used after the model has been trained and validated to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Commonly, the dataset is split into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, the exact ratio may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being solved. In some cases, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation may be used instead of splitting the dataset into fixed subsets.

It should be noted that the context mentions the use of hyperparameters such as "mtry" and "ntree" in the random forest algorithm, which suggests that the authors likely considered the importance of proper data partitioning and avoiding overfitting. Additionally, the context discusses the use of regularization parameters to avoid overfitting in artificial neural networks, further indicating the authors' awareness of the need for appropriate data splitting strategies.
