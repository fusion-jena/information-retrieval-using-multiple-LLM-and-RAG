Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments. 

5.1.5. Total layers in the model

classification tasks. The evaluation of model performance was based on 
the  accuracy  metric.  Each  model  underwent  training  for  10  epochs, 
utilizing  a  batch  size  of  32.  The  class  mode  was  set  to  ‘categorical,’ 
indicating  that  the  labels  were  encoded  using  one-hot  encoding  for 
multi-class  classification  tasks.  These  generalized  parameter  settings 
were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and 
standardization throughout the study experiments.

where Mconv  denotes the convolutional layers of the pre-trained model. 
In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained model’s weights are further 
optimized on the target dataset to adapt the model to the specific clas-
sification task. This involves training the additional layers added on top 
of the pre-trained model while keeping the pre-trained weights fixed or 
partially  updating  them.  The  fine-tuning  process  adjusts  the  model’s 
parameters to better fit the target dataset, capturing task-specific pat-
terns.  It  involves  minimizing  a  loss  function,  typically  a  categorical 
cross-entropy loss, using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as 
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The loss function measures 
the discrepancy between the predicted class probabilities and the true 
labels in the target dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it mentions that each model underwent training for 10 epochs utilizing a batch size of 32. Additionally, the class mode was set to 'categorical,' indicating that the labels were encoded using one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. These generalized parameter settings were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments. While these steps contribute to maintaining consistency and fairness during the experimentation phase, they do not directly address the issue of generalizability. To improve the generalizability of the models, techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or regularization methods could have been employed. Unfortunately, there is no mention of these techniques in the given context.
