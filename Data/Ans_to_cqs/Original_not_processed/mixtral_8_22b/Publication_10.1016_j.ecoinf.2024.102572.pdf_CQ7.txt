within the published data ranges (min: 0.928; max: 41.2145 tons per 
hectare), confirming the dataset’s validity for the regions under study.

3.1.4. Calculate processing 

The following processes were carried out within GEE to produce a 
thorough  time  series  dataset  that  included  land  cover  types,  wildfire 
locations, NBR, and above-ground biomass data in mainland China:  

• First, filter the feature collection on GEE by using the MCD64A1 date 
attribute  “Burndate”  (calendar  day).  The  range  1–366  is  used  to 
represent  the  fire  occurrence  area  that  has  been  labeled  as  “Bur-
narea.”  After that, it was easier to extract the land cover types for 
each  year  by  overlaying  MCD12Q1,  and  MOD17A3  was  used  to 
calculate the annual NPP. The “ForestFireArea” image collection was 
then created by adding attribute information using the “image.add-
Bands()” API.

research center. The Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in 
Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting datasets randomly, stratified sampling based on target variable distribution, or temporal/spatial partitioning depending on the nature of the problem. In this case, since the research involves time series data and spatial analysis, it might be beneficial to consider temporal or spatial splits when dividing the data. Nonetheless, without more details about the specific deep learning models being employed, it remains uncertain which method would be most suitable.
