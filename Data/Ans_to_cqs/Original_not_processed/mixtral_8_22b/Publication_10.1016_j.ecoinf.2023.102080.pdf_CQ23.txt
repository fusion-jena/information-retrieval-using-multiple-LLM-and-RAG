Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Step B: Model-specific embedding 

In Step B, covariates selected after Step A are used to fit models with 
embedded selection procedures. We use GLM with elastic-net regulari-
zation  (GLM-EN)  (Zou  and  Hastie,  2005),  GAM  with  null-space

3.3. Model fitting and assessment 

Selected covariate sets from the main (one embedded, one filter, and 
ten  random)  and  complementary  (ten  random  after  Step  B  and  ten 
random after Step A) procedures were used for fitting GLM, GAM and RF 
models. Details on the hyperparameters used for model fitting are pro-

We compared the average computation time needed for (i) running 
the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under 
each of the three main procedures, and (ii) model fitting only. Analyses 
were run using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD®

Helpful Answer:
The authors did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they did evaluate the performance of various models, including GLM, GAM, and Random Forests, by calculating metrics like Area Under the Curve (AUC), maxTSS, CBI, and Score values using a split-sample strategy repeated 100 times with 30% of the data kept aside for validation. This approach can help assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of these models. Additionally, the analyses were conducted using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD® EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster, which may contribute to computational efficiency and reproducibility.
