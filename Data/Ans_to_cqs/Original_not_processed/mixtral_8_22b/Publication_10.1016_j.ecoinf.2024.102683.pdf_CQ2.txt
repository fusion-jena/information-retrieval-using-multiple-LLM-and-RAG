Deep learning (DL) has become an advanced method in the field of 
computer science, but despite their high learning capacity, models based 
on DL often face a challenge called overfitting. To overcome the over-
fitting problem, deep neural networks must be supported by a significant 
amount of labeled data. Data augmentation (DA) technique is used as a 
basic  method  to  quantitatively  increase  and  diversify  training  data 
(Momeny et al., 2021; Momeny et al., 2023). DA is a technique in which 
the training set is artificially increased by creating modified copies of a 
dataset using the existing data. Using a designed set of DAs instead of 
simple  random  transformations  during  data  training  can  significantly 
improve  the  generalization  ability  of  the  network  (Hsia  et  al.,  2022; 
Jahanbakhshi et al., 2021a; Momeny et al., 2022). As the name suggests, 
automatic DA methods work automatically, and help us avoid the per-

2.5. Evaluation of classifiers 

The performance of the proposed model was compared with other 
state-of-the-art models. To do this, the collected dataset was trained and 
evaluated  using  different  residual  structures,  Inception-v3,  VGG-11, 
VGG-19, Alex Net, GoogleNet, and Squeeze Net models. In this research, 
classification operations of images were carried out in MATLAB R2016a 
software.  The  proposed  models  were  simulated  in  the  deep  learning 
toolbox on a system equipped with an Intel(R) Core i7-5500U, CPU 3.0 
GHz with 64 GB of RAM, and Nvidia GeForce 1070 GPU. 

2.6. Evaluation criteria of classifiers 

In  order  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  all  image  classification 
models,  the  criteria  of  accuracy,  precision,  recall,  specificity,  and  F1- 
score  were  used  based  on  eqs.  8  to  12  (Azadnia  et  al.,  2022b;  Azizi 
et al., 2024; Marhamati et al., 2024). 

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

Precision = TP

TP + FP

Recall = TP

attention mechanisms enhance efficiency of deep learning (DL) networks by allowing them to precisely focus on 
all relevant input elements. In order to enhance the performance of the proposed model, the CA was implemented 
based on four pooling operations including global average pooling-based CA (GAP-CA), mixed pooling-based CA 
(Mixed-CA), gated pooling-based CA (Gated-CA), and tree pooling-based CA (Tree-CA) operations. The results 
showed that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art 
models, achieving the values of 99.63%, 99.38%, 99.52%, 99.74%, and 99.42%, for accuracy, precision, recall, 
specificity, and F1-score, respectively. The findings support our proposed attention model's success in identifying 
medicinal  plants  from  similar  poisonous  plants.  Recent  advancements  in  computer-based  technologies  and

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the numerous mentions of image datasets and image classification throughout the text. For instance, the evaluation of classifiers section discusses how the collected dataset was trained and evaluated using various residual structures and models such as Inception-v3, VGG-11, VGG-19, Alex Net, GoogleNet, and Squeeze Net models. Additionally, the evaluation criteria of classifiers section specifies that the performance of all image classification models was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Furthermore, the mention of MATLAB R2016a software being used for carrying out classification operations further supports the notion that images are the main data format utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being employed in the deep learning process. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
