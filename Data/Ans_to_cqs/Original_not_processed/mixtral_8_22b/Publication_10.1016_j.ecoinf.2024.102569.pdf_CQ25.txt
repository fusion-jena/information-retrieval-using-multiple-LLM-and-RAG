where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods. 

In  the  understanding  of  ecological  processes,  there  are  situations

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about a specific deep learning model used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, it discusses using machine learning techniques for predictive modeling in ecology. Specifically, the authors propose a new method called Maximum Entropy Density Estimation (MEDE), which they compare with another method called Minimum Divergence Estimation (MIDE). Both methods aim to improve predictions of species distributions by accounting for heterogeneity in observation data. The goal is to create more accurate models that can help understand ecological processes and inform conservation efforts.
