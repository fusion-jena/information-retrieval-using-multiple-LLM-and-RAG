The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in 
image  preprocessing  used  the  Landsat  8  SR  images  (High  resolution 
satellite  L2)  from  the  GEE  platform.  Only  the  chosen  photos  were

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study involves image processing and analysis using remote sensing data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands and Google Earth Engine (GEE). However, there is no specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Nevertheless, some common preprocessing techniques used in image processing include normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and feature extraction. Normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, while scaling adjusts the range of pixel values. Cleaning removes noise and artifacts from images, while augmentation increases the size of the dataset through transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. Feature extraction extracts relevant features from images that can be used as input to machine learning models. In summary, the exact preprocessing steps required depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being trained.
