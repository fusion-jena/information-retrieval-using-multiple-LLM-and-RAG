10.3.2 Species Selection

For the genericity of our results and to make sure they are not biased by the choice
of a particular category of species, we have chosen to work with a high number of
randomly chosen species. From the 7626 initial species, we selected species with
more than 300 observations. We selected amongst those a random subset of 1000
species to constitute an ensemble E1000. Then, we randomly selected 200 species
amongst E1000 to constitute E200, and ﬁnally randomly selected 50 in E200 which

gave E50. E50 being the main dataset used to compare our model to the baselines, we
provide in Fig. 10.1 the list of species composing it. The full dataset with species
of E1000 contains 6,134,016 observations in total (see Table 10.1 for the detailed
informations per species).

10.1.3 Contribution

In the NN models learning, there is still work to be done on quick automated
procedure for tuning optimization hyper-parameters, especially the initial learning
rate, and we are looking for a more suited stopping rule. On the other hand, in the
case of models of species distributions, we can imagine to minimize the number of
not null connections in the network, to make it more interpretable, and introduce an
L1-type penalty on the network parameters. This is a potential important perspective
of future works.
