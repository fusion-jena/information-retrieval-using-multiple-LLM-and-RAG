encountered  at  a  given  location.  However,  this  information  is  not 
directly integrated into the classifier, and the results from the metadata 
model are not utilized to improve identification performance. Further-
more,  while  it  is  possible  to  access  the  architecture  of  the  metadata 
model, no information regarding the training process or the data used is 
provided. There is currently an underutilization of metadata in the field 
of bioacoustics, despite the increased availability of such data through 
citizen  science  platforms  (Pocock  et  al.,  2015;  Silvertown,  2009; 
Swanson et al., 2015). While methods have been developed to tackle this 
issue in image classification (Tang et al., 2015; Aodha et al., 2019; Terry 
et  al.,  2020),  no  clear  and  practical  method  has  been  proposed  for 
bioacoustics.  Therefore,  this  study  aims  to  fill  this  gap  by  exploring 
various  methods  to  incorporate  metadata,  such  as  time  and  location,

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some potential criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss over several epochs. In the absence of explicit information, these general principles can guide our understanding of when training might typically be considered complete.
