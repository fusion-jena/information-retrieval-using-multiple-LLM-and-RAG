Number of cells in hidden layers: Vital for fitting complex functions, 
the range for the number of cells in each layer is set between 10 and 200. 
This range balances the need to capture intricate data patterns and avoid 
overfitting. 

Initial learning rate: This determines the step size during parameter

Helpful Answer:
During the training process, the TPEBO-LSTM model systematically records the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. This monitoring strategy allows for identifying the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations. By logging these details, it becomes possible to track the progress of the model and adjust its parameters accordingly to achieve better results.
