Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Furthermore, proposed models and their specific hyper-parameters do 
not  always  behave  as  nicely  as  reported  outside  their  benchmark 
datasets.

The  models  were  trained  for  100  epochs  using  Adam  optimizer 
(Kingma and Ba, 2017) with the default hyper-parameters and a cosine 
decay  scheduler  for  the  learning  rate.  The  loss  function  was  cross- 
entropy for multi-class single-label classification. The macro-averaged 
f1-score  on  the  validation  set  aided  in  monitoring  the  model  conver-
gence. Macro averaging gives equal importance to all classes regardless 
of the number of data points in each one.

It  seems  to  require  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  each  species’  fre-
quency  niche  to  create  optimal  individualized  features.  Yet,  the  most 
celebrated capability of deep neural networks is automatic and task(s)- 
relevant feature extraction while doing the classification task(s) jointly, 
which  has  led  to  unprecedented  achievements  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015). 
Hence, one could ask whether to consider a time-frequency represen-
tation or the waveform as raw input to neural networks to capture all the 
relevant information from bird vocalization. Although the former is the 
prevalent  approach,  data  processing  inequality  indicates  that  post- 
processing can not increase a signal’s information (Beaudry and Ren-
ner,  2011).  Therefore,  the  waveform  is  a  promising  alternative  to 
traditional features derived from it when leveraging neural networks.

Recent years have seen impressive progress in bird species recogni-
tion and related tasks (Stowell, 2022; Xie et al., 2023). It was foreseeable 
that  deep  learning  would  emerge  as  the  most  successful  method  for 
large-scale  bioacoustics  analysis  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021;  Stowell,  2022; 
Stowell et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zsebok et al., 
2019). The main advantage of neural networks is to avoid many brittle 
and  difficult  choices  in  designing  manual  features  for  the  underlying 
task. For example, Xie et al. (Xie and Zhu, 2019) compared three types of 
features  for  bird  species  classification  consisting  of  hand-crafted 
acoustic features, including features from Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-
efficient (MFCC), visual features extracted from the Constant-Q Trans-
form (CQT) time-frequency representation, and training a convolutional 
network directly on the CQT. They also tested the fusion of classifiers

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning model was trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017) with the default hyperparameters. A cosine decay scheduler was employed for the learning rate. The loss function utilized was cross-entropy for multi-class single-label classification. The macro-averaged f1-score on the validation set assisted in monitoring the model convergence.
