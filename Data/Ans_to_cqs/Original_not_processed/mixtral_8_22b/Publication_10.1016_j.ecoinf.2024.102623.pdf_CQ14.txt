situation, our approach can be effectively combined with methods that 
aggregate nearby species presences, such as Kellenberger et al. (2022). 
Furthermore, we observed in Fig. 4 (right) and Fig. 5 that different 
species within the same region may have different optimal values for the 
hyperparameter λ2. Consequently, setting distinct λ2  values per species 
could  improve  model  performance.  In  particular,  higher  values  of  λ2 
could be set for known generalist species, especially if there is a strong 
sampling  bias.  While  the  evaluation  in  this  study  focused  on  multi- 
species  neural  networks,  it  is  straightforward  to  adapt  our  loss  func-
tion to single-species neural networks by removing the summation over 
species and retaining only the species of interest.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, based on the given data, it appears that the hyperparameter λ2 was tested using various values ranging from 2 to 2048. It is possible that either a grid search or a manual search method was used to find the optimal λ2 value for each region. Grid search involves testing all combinations of a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm, while manual search involves trying different values one at a time until satisfactory results are achieved. Without further information, it cannot be determined which specific optimization technique was employed.
