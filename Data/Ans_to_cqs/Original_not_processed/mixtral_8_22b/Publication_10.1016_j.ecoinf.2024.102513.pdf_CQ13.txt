where  zi  is  the  output  value  of  the  i-th  neuron,  wj  is  the  convolution 
weight for input value xj, bi  is the bias, and f is the activation function. 
The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

The Fully Connected Layer represents a classic multi-layer percep-
tron  and  performs  matrix  multiplication  between  input  data  and 
weights. It enables the model to capture more complex nonlinear de-
pendencies  and  generalize  information  from  previous  layers.  Each 
neuron in the fully connected layer receives input data from all neurons 
in the previous layer and applies an activation function to obtain the 
output value. 

The Output Layer is the final layer of the neural network, generating 
LULC  classification  predictions.  Typically,  an  activation  function  like 
Softmax is used to obtain probability estimates for each LULC class. 

The LULC Map is the ultimate result of classification, representing a 
spatial  map  of  land  use  and  land  cover.  Each  pixel  in  the  LULC  map 
depicts the class to which it belongs, based on the model's predictions.

of deep learning, a neural network was meticulously trained using these 
datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures.

2.3. Performing LULC analysis using a deep convolutional neural network 

The  classification  of  LULC  was  carried  out  using  a  convolutional 
neural network (CNN). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an 
architecture of deep neural networks widely applied for land use and 
land cover (LULC) classification (Balarabe and Jordanov, 2021; Li et al., 
2019;  Zaabar  et  al.,  2022).  They  are  specifically  designed  for  image 
processing  and  possess  the  capability  to  automatically  extract  spatial 
hierarchical features from data.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. These details would typically be included in a description of the model architecture or training procedure, but they aren't mentioned here. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the hyperparameters used in this particular case.
