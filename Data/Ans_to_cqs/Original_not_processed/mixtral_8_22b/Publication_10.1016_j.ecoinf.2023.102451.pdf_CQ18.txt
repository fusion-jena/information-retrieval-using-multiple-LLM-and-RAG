3.4. Performance evaluation 

The classification performance of the proposed model EMViT-Net is 
assessed by calculating the precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of the 
model as these are the most popular performance evaluation indicators. 
The precision defines the ratio of true positive to all positive predicted 
samples.  The  sensitivity  is  also  known  as  recall  which  defines  the 
number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples 
and the f1-score is a general indicator of precision and recall. The ac-
curacy  of  a  model  can  be  measured  by  calculating  the  ratio  of  true 
positive and true negative to the overall collected samples. Here true

3.5. Evaluated results of EMViT-Net

capable of learning weights for a generalized trained model on the un-
seen test set of EMDS-6. In model optimization learning rate was set to 
0.002 and the batch size was set to 32. The proposed model is trained for 
100 epochs with optimizer AdamW and the activation function GELU 
which  are  chosen  very  carefully  due  to  their  effectiveness  with  the 
proposed  model  for  the  considered  dataset.  Finally,  the  default  loss 
function  cross-entropy  is  used  to  calculate  the  loss  of  the  proposed 
network. By considering all the results of this section taken into account 
it was found that the proposed model EMViT-Net may be considered as 
fast and more reliable due to its low computational cost and efficiency. 
The loss and accuracy curves of the reported network are given in 
Fig.  5.  which  represents  training  and  validation  accuracy  with  their 
corresponding loss for the proposed model EMViT-Net with a specific

configuration of optimizer and learning rate which has been considered 
for the training of the framework. The EMViT-Net framework achieves 
prominent results as compared to other deep learning models and per-
forms better with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets.

Helpful Answer:

To monitor the model performance during training, the authors use several strategies. They evaluate the performance of the proposed model, EMViT-Net, using popular performance evaluation indicators such as precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. These metrics help determine how well the model classifies images from the EMDS-6 dataset.

For model optimization, they set the learning rate to 0.002 and the batch size to 32. The model is then trained for 100 epochs using the AdamW optimizer and the GELU activation function. This combination of hyperparameters and functions is selected based on their effectiveness with the proposed model and the considered dataset.

Additionally, the authors employ the default loss function, cross-entropy, to calculate the loss of the proposed network. To visualize the progress of the training process, they plot the loss and accuracy curves for both training and validation sets. These graphs provide insights into how well the model learns over time and whether it might suffer from underfitting or overfitting issues.

Overall, the authors implement a comprehensive approach to monitoring the model performance during training, combining various evaluation metrics, careful selection of hyperparameters, and visualization tools to ensure optimal results.
