maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

3.2.2.8. LGBM  hyperparameter  tweaking. Table  2  shows  the  LGBM 
model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

This evaluation helps choose hyperparameters that reduce prediction 
errors and improve model precision. After testing many combinations, 
the best ones were found. During model overfitting, n_estimators, max_-
depth,  and  subsample  were  most  affected.  These  variables  govern  the 
model’s  complexity  and  generalization  to  prevent  overfitting  the 
training  set.  Decisions  were  based  on  whether  final  hyperparameter 
combinations could reduce overfitting and increase model functionality. 
Overfitting  is  common  with  boosting  models.  Hyperparameters  effec-
tively address these  difficulties. Initial hyperparameter  values  for col-
sample_bytree,  learning  rate,  max_depth,  and  n_estimators  were  varied. 
Collapse_by_tree, learning rate, max_depth, and n_estimators range from 0 to 
1, 1, 20, and 200.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included data on various water quality parameters (WQPs), such as nitrates and dissolved oxygen (DO). This diversity in the dataset helped to create a robust model capable of handling different types of input data. Secondly, cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the model's performance and select optimal hyperparameters. Specifically, fivefold cross-validation was applied, where the dataset was divided into five equal-sized folds. Each fold served as a validation set once while the remaining folds formed the training set. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive model performance analysis by averaging coefficients of determination (R^2) or root mean square errors (RMSE) across five iterations with five folds. Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned; however, the use of subsamples and controlling local pattern sensitivities through min\_child\_samples helped reduce overfitting and improved the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
