Long-term land use P and N loss models often employ land use maps, 
soil maps, and other generic spatial datasets as inputs. The results of this 
work demonstrated that, in the extremely vulnerable NWH ecosystem, 
changes in land use impacted the spatial distribution of TSN and TSP. 
Thus,  the  quantification  of  these  changes  would  contribute  to  the 
regional  scale  P  and  N  transfer  models.  This  procedure  includes  an 
evaluation of soil and ecological variables related with such changes, 
which are preferably quantified from current databases as described in 
Fig. 3 that has been obtained by a kriging method using data collected 
from  the  field.  The  accuracy  of  any  spatial  prediction  is  critical  as  it 
determines  the  quality  of  the  interpolated  values.  In  this  work  the 
diagnostic measures of quality of spatial prediction were evaluated by

The outputs of the Land Use and Land Cover studies (LULC) based on 
the  Geographic  information  system  (GIS)  indicate  that  agricultural 
(30%), horticultural (40%), and forest land (about 16%) uses account 
for >86% of the total area of the region studied. The remaining area 
includes  wastelands,  ravine  streams  and  urbanized  sites.  The  land 
mostly  consists  of  mountains  and  valleys.  The  river  Jhelum  and  its 
tributaries are the principal irrigation supplies. In the northwest part of 
the  study  area is  located the  Wular Lake,  the  Asia biggest freshwater 
lake. The native vegetation in the region includes Pinus spp., Fir spp., 
Citrus spp., Salix spp., Populus spp., and Ulmus spp.. The Indian gov-
ernment  has  prohibited  deforestation  in  the  region  because  of  its 
extreme vulnerability (Bashir et al., 2022). Fig. 1 provides an illustrative 
map of the area studied.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the network becomes more robust and can better generalize to new data. Dropout rates typically range from 0.2 to 0.5, depending on the complexity of the problem and the size of the network.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the cost function proportional to the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and reducing the risk of overfitting. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter called lambda, which determines how much emphasis is placed on minimizing the penalty term compared to minimizing the error term.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization works similarly to L2 Regularization but penalizes the absolute value of the weights instead of their square. Early Stopping stops training once validation performance starts to degrade, while Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations to existing data.

In summary, regularization methods like Dropout and L2 Regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding constraints to the optimization process. These methods encourage simpler models that generalize better to new data, improving overall performance.
