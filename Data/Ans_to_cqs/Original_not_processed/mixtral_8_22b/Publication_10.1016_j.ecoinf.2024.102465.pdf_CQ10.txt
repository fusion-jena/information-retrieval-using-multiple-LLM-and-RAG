The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

In  response  to  the  increasing  demand  for  processing  multi-source 
data  in  built  environment  research,  researchers  have  increasingly 
adopted  machine  learning  models.  Notably,  the  open-source  eXtreme 
Gradient  Boosting  (XGBoost)  model,  rooted  in  GBDT,  has  gained 
prominence  for  its  robust  explanatory  and  predictive  capabilities 
(Todorovic et al., 2023; T. Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Employed across 
various  fields,  XGBoost  has  been  particularly  useful  in  addressing 
complex  problems  (Chen  et  al.,  2023c).  In  recent  years,  scholars  in 
various fields have begun employing the XGBoost model and integrating 
multi-source  data  for  built  environment  studies.  Their  research  spans 
topics like spatial vitality (Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a), spatial 
heterogeneity (J. Zhang et al., 2023b), landscape impacts on ecological 
vulnerability  (Xu  et  al.,  2022),  and  implications  for  human  health

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be best to refer to the original paper or contact the authors directly for more detailed information regarding their code repository.
