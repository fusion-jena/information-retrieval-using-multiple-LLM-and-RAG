On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

Our proposed detector-2 was based on EfficientDet-B7. EfficientDet 
frameworks are well optimised with the input image sizes of 512, 640, 
768,  896,  1024,  1280,  1280,  and  1536  for  the  family  network 
EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDetD7, respectively. These optimised image 
sizes achieved the highest accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. We set up 
the model config file with a class number 1, image size of 1536 × 1536, 
batch size of 16, initial learning rate of 2e3, momentum optimiser value 
of 0.5 and step number of 400,000. We also monitored the validation 
loss  using  early  stopping  during  training  for  every  epoch.  We 
consciously monitored the validation accuracy to stop overfitting and 
overtraining  with  a  patience  of  20.  We  have  used  TensorFlow  object 
detection  API.  First,  we  downloaded  the  pre-trained  EfficientDet-D7 
model weight from the TensorFlow-2 object detection model zoo page.

(of 94.5%) using the deep learning–based CNN model. Martin-Abadal 
et  al.  (Martin-Abadal  et  al.,  2018)  estimated  seagrass  meadows  by 
applying  an  encoder  decoder-based  model  (VGG16FCN8).  They  ach-
ieved a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81% on their dataset. 
Meanwhile,  Weidmann et  al.  (Weidmann et  al., 2019) found  that the 
deep  learning–based  DeepLabv3+ model  achieves  the  highest  perfor-
mance  (with  a  mean  intersection  over  union  (mIoU)  of  87.78%) 
compared  to  the  fully  convolutional  networks,  dilated  convolution 
networks (dilNets) and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset.

0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, it can be noted that the authors mentioned using TensorFlow Object Detection API, which suggests that they might have used publicly available resources or libraries. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about the availability of the code repository.
