reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the parkâ€™s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

2.4. Modifying the landscape design 

This step aims to adjust the landscape design based on the assessment 
results. The restorative map helps better understand the design quality, 
enabling planners to grasp design strengths and weaknesses. Areas with 
high  scores  indicate  high  restorative  potential,  whereas  areas  of 
underperformance  with  low  scores  signify  zones  requiring  significant 
enhancement in restorative potential. Planners can improve their design 
further by addressing any weaknesses identified. The updated design is 
fed into previous steps for model development, point cloud generation 
and performance assessment. The iterative process continues until the 
high-performance design or desired objectives are achieved.

time to conduct surveys for restorative assessment and adjust the land-
scape design for quality improvement. To tackle the challenges of the 
lengthy time requirements and subjective nature of the design process, it 
is  imperative  to  develop  a  method  for  quantitative  assessment  of 
restorative quality to improve the effectiveness of landscape planning 
and design.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, we can infer that the process involves generating a restorative map using the trained model, which helps identify areas with high restorative potential and those needing enhancement. This map is then used to modify the landscape design, focusing on improving underperforming areas. After modifying the design, it is fed back into the system for further model development, point cloud generation, and performance assessment. This iterative process continues until achieving a high-performance design or meeting desired objectives. Although not explicitly mentioned, common postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, and confusion matrices could be employed during this process to evaluate and fine-tune the model's performance.
