2.4. Extraction of taxa records and metadata 

Occurrence records of selected denitrifiers reported for years 2018 to 
2022 (Appendix A), and marked as ‘Present’ in GBIF (accessed on 2022- 
08-06),  were  downloaded  using  “rgbif”  package  (Chamberlain  et  al., 
2023;  Chamberlain  and  Boettiger,  2017)  in  the  RStudio  environment 
(RStudio Team, 2020). 

Searching protocol for occurrence records in the database was per-
formed by a search filter for scientific names using the genus and species 
for  each  selected  taxon.  Search  filters  were  also  applied  by  entering 
multiple  species  names  belonging  to  the  same  genus  (e.g.  Shewanella 
putrefaciens, S. frigidimarina, S. oneidensis, or S. denitrificans) or entering 
the taxon and its closest phylogenetic relative (e.g. Alteromonas elyakovii

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is located based solely on this information. It could potentially be found in any version control system such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further details, we can only speculate.
