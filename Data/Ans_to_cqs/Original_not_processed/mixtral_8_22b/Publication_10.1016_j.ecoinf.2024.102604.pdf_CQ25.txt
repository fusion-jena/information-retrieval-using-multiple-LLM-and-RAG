on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018).

Random  Forests  (RF)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019),  Boosted  Regression  Trees 
(BRT) (Hellegers et al., 2020) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) (Phillips

only presence data, has become a widely used SDM because of its su-
perior predictive ability (Wisz et al., 2008), particularly given the dif-
ficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

%Query
Query: "What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the use of terms like'sampling bias','species distribution models', 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)', and 'delta D', it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for classification or prediction tasks related to ecological studies, specifically in the field of species distribution modeling. This could involve classifying areas where certain species are likely to be found based on various environmental factors or predicting changes in species distributions due to factors like climate change or human activities.
