Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

B. Deep Learning Experiment

The second experiment is similar to the ﬁrst one but it uses
deep learning CNNs to determine if the SSPB introduces a
signiﬁcant bias. It corresponds to the second row in Figure I.
There is no segmentation applied to the data, only a resize to
224x224 pixels before running the network on the data.

V. RESULTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

Table III shows the results related to the hand-crafted feature
extraction approach experiment. The accuracy obtained is
always considerably better when the biased dataset is used,
with a 26.4% difference when top-5 is used. This clearly shows
that SSPB introduces a signiﬁcant bias.

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

2) Unbiased Dataset: For each species X in dataset D, we
tried to approximate a 70%-30% distribution as in the Biased
Dataset case. However, in order to avoid the SSPB, we used
the unique specimen identiﬁer to place images from the same
specimen in eiher the training dataset or the testing dataset.
This restriction alone could not be achievable if, for example,
one species X has photos of several leaves but they are all
from the same specimen. Our dataset D was created so that it
precludes such scenario, as there are photos from at least two
different specimens for each species X in dataset D. However,
this restriction clearly makes it harder to approximate the ideal
70%-30% distribution both, at the species level and globally.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors address data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline using stratified splitting. They create two datasets - a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset. The biased dataset is created by taking 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, approximating these percentages for each species in the dataset. However, this can result in a significant bias due to Species Sampling Proportional Bias (SSPB), where some species have more samples than others. To mitigate this, the authors create an unbiased dataset. In this case, they still attempt to achieve a 70%-30% distribution for each species, but they ensure that images from the same specimen are placed either in the training dataset or the testing dataset. This prevents any potential leakage between the training and testing sets, which could lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. While the paper does not explicitly mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques could also potentially help reduce data bias in deep learning pipelines. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes, while undersampling removes examples from overrepresented classes. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and variations within each class.
