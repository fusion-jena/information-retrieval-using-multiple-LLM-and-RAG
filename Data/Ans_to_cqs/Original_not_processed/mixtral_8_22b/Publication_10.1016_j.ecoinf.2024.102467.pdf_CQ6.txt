EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

A  bottleneck  transformer  is  a  simple  but  powerful  transformer 
structure. Self-attention models in the field of vision can be classified 
into  Pure  Attention  Models  and  Convolution  Attention  Models.  The 
advantage of convolution-based models is their parameter sharing and 
efficient local information aggregation capabilities. To integrate global 
information, convolution-based models require the stacking of multiple 
convolutional layers. Self-attention, on the other hand, has the ability to 
obtain  global  information.  Therefore,  combining  self-attention  and 
convolution  can  reduce  the  network  depth  and  improve  the  model’s 
performance. BoTNet replaces the 3 × 3 spatial convolutions in ResNet’s 
last  three  bottleneck  blocks  with  multi-head  self-attention  (MHSA) 
(Srinivas et al., 2021). The memory and computational requirements for 
self-attention  are  quadratic  in  the  spatial  dimension,  and  these  re-

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model such as EfficientNetV2 or BotNet, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the specific dataset and task. These steps help prepare the data for optimal performance during training and inference. Here are some common preprocessing techniques used in deep learning:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, incorrect, or duplicate data from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization: Normalization scales the input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps stabilize the learning process and accelerate convergence. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, which scales the data between 0 and 1, and z-score normalization, which standardizes the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Scaling: Scaling rescales the input features so they fall within a certain range. For example, images are often scaled to [0, 255] for grayscale images or [0, 1] for normalized RGB images.

4. Augmentation: Data augmentation generates new samples by applying random transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc. This increases the diversity of the dataset and improves the robustness of the trained model.

5. Encoding: Some datasets contain categorical variables that need to be converted into numerical form using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

6. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features from the dataset can significantly impact the performance of the deep learning model. Techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or even manual selection based on domain knowledge can be employed.
