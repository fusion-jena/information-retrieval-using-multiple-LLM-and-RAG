the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

the  research conducted  by Kim et  al. (2021a).  Therefore, even in the 
absence of specific classes, using phenological characteristics, elements 
can still be classified on the basis of using classes that are most relevant. 
As  suggested  by  Kim  et  al.  (2021a),  the  classification  accuracy  and 
performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep 
learning  model  using  satellite  imageries  over  multiple  periods,  (Kim 
et al., 2021b). Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model 
can be used effectively. As a result, by employing PCF with DA, we could

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or outliers in the training data instead of generalizing from the underlying pattern. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning among them. By ignoring some neurons, the model becomes more robust and less likely to rely too heavily on any single feature. Dropout is often applied between layers in a deep learning architecture.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less prone to overfitting. It is called L2 because it uses the L2 norm (Euclidean distance) of the weights.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other popular regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, like L2, adds a penalty term but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of their squares. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to existing examples, helping the model generalize better.
