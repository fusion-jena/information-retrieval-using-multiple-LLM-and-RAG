Equation values >86.976 are classified as fisher and values less than 
this  value  are  classified  as  marten.  Statistical  summaries  of  measure-
ments for the most important variables for species identification from 
predictor  screening  and  the  final  species  discrimination  model  are 
detailed in Table 2. 

3.4.2. Fisher sex discrimination

We photographed each front footprint from directly above with a metric

We  used  a  stepwise  variable  selection  procedure  with  the  p-value 
serving as the decisive factor (threshold of 0.05) to select the variables 
that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. We used 
linear  discriminant  analysis  to  generate  a  discrimination  line  (2  vari-
ables) or hyperplane (>3 variables) depending on the number of vari-
ables  in  the  resulting  model  to  classify  species  or  sex.  To  quantify 
uncertainty  in  classification,  we  then  generated  bands  of  uncertainty 
around  this  discrimination  hyperplane.  We  assigned  values  that  fall 
within these bands a probability value (p) indicating a level of certainty 
about the classification using a logistic regression model, as in Eq. (1)

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, etc. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, and Area Under Curve (AUC) represents degree or measure of separability.
