We trained IUC-NN on all species with an IUCN RL as-
sessment and available occurrence records. Prior to the
training, we randomly split the data set into a training
set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). We used
20% of the training set for validation. Because the size
of the data set was comparatively small, we performed
cross-validation by shifting the validation set 5 times to
quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and ac-
curacy. We then used the neural network with the lowest
cross-entropy loss across a range of models with differ-
ent numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features to
predict the conservation status of all orchid species at
2 levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened)
and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC). See Supporting
Information for details on the network architecture and
training. We combined the IUC-NN assessments with dis-
tribution data from WCSP to show the number and pro-

We implemented a deep neural network algorithm
(Goodfellow et al. 2016)—IUC-NN—as an R package
(IUCNN, available at https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN)
based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow (https://
www.tensorflow.org) library to predict the conservation
status of unevaluated orchid species. We based the pre-
dictions on 4 groups of features, derivable from digitally
available occurrence records: geographic (mean latitude
and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent
of occurrence [EOO], area of occupancy [AOO], number
of locations [sensu IUCN], and occurrence records); cli-
matic (mean of 19 bioclim variables [Karger et al. 2017]);
biome (presence in 14 biomes [Olson et al. 2001]); and

anthropogenic (mean Human Footprint Index [Wildlife
Conservation Society & International Earth Science In-
formation Network 2005]).

Including data on species trade, land use, or life his-
tory, once they are available, may help increase the ac-
curacy of IUC-NN and overcome dependency on threat
category (Supporting Information). Additionally, combin-
ing the binary and detailed model, the results of which
were contradictory in some cases (Supporting Informa-
tion), may increase the performance of IUC-NN. We sug-
gest that labeling species where the binary and detailed
model disagree as data deficient might reduce the num-
ber of false predictions. Future developments of IUC-NN
will quantify the estimation of threat as a continuous pa-
rameter to increase the accuracy for intermediate threat
levels and will implement Bayesian neural networks to
quantify uncertainties in the prediction (Silvestro & An-
dermann 2020).

Helpful Answer: The paper uses a custom deep neural network called IUC-NN, which stands for IUCN Red List Neural Network. It does not explicitly state whether it is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformers, or another type of deep learning model. However, since it is built using TensorFlow, it could potentially be any of these types depending on how the authors have designed their specific implementation.
