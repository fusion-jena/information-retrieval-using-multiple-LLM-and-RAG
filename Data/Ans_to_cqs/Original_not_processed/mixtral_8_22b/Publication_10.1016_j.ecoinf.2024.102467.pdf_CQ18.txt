speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a

computing  resources  during  the  training  process.  In  the  experiments 
conducted  in  this  study,  under  the  same  training  environment  and 
epoch, the algorithm was trained on an RTX 3090 for 6 h. The video 
memory usage was 12 G. The training time of the original YOLOv5 al-
gorithm was 12 h. The video memory usage was 17.1 G. Fig. 10 visually 
compares the parameter quantities and detection efficiency between the 
two models. The significant reduction in model size and inference time 
indicates that the model in this study is more suitable for deployment in 
agricultural embedded devices.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity and model size compared to the original YOLOv5 algorithm. This suggests that monitoring strategies such as tracking resource utilization (e.g., GPU memory usage), training time, or other relevant metrics could have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimized model. Additionally, techniques like validation set evaluation or cross-validation might also be utilized to assess the model's generalization capabilities during training. Nevertheless, without further details from the authors, one cannot definitively state the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
