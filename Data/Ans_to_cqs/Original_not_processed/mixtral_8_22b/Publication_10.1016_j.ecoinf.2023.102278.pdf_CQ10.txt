The  ResNet50  architecture  (He  et  al.,  2016)  was  modified  and 
trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet 
(Smith,  2018).  Models  trained  with  transfer  learning  outperformed 
models trained with random weights with an increase of 4% in the F1-

Hierarchies  are  pervasive  across  deep  learning  applications.  How-
ever, they are especially important when classifying living organisms, as 
each  species  has  a  unique  position  on  the  tree  of  life.  Insects  are 
particularly diverse, comprising important pollinators, pests, prey, and 
decomposer species. Furthermore, many insect species cannot be veri-
fied without dissection or genetic analysis. By leveraging known taxo-
nomic  relationships  among  easily  identifiable  species,  our  approach 
helps to classify unverifiable specimens at a higher taxonomic level. This 
could be especially useful in pest detection, for example where cryptic 
relatives of pest species must also be detected (Preti et al., 2021).
