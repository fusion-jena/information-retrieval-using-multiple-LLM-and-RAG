In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The  forecast  performance  of  deep  learning  models  varies  across 
different Chl concentration regions. In the high Chl concentration region 
(point A), the R2  values are the lowest, while in the low Chl concen-
tration region (point C), the R2 values are the highest (Fig. 6). Among the 
models,  the  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  consistently  achieves  the  highest  R2 
values  across  all  regions,  whereas  the  CNN  model  has  the  lowest  R2 
values (Fig. 6).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
