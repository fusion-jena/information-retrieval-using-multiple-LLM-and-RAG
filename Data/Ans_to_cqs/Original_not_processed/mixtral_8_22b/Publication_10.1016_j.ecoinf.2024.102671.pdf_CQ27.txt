The InVEST model was employed in this study to simulate changes in 
ecosystem  services,  encompassing  a  range  of  sub-models  (Guo  et  al., 
2021c; Sharp et  al., 2020). It is  particularly effective  in assessing the 
impact of Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) on carbon storage 
variations, holding practical significance in both domestic and interna-
tional research (Guo et al., 2023). In this study, the model was utilized to 
determine  the  aggregate  carbon  storage  and  to  measure  the  carbon 
sequestration  from  2000  to  2020.  A  positive  sequestration  value  sig-
nifies an enhancement in carbon storage over this period, indicating the 
ecosystem’s role as a carbon sink by absorbing more CO2. Conversely, a 
negative  value  denotes  a  reduction  in  carbon  storage,  reflecting 
increased CO2 emissions from the ecosystem. Carbon density values for 
each  land  use  category,  a  critical  input  for  the  InVEST  model,  were

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately determine the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed through several steps such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be saved and loaded later, often as a binary file. The choice of platform depends on various factors like computational resources, scalability requirements, and ease of integration. Once these decisions have been made, the serialized model can then be integrated into existing systems or applications for real-world usage.
