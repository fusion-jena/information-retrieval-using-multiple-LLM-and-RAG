grass rush pasture in GMEP. However, if contextual datasets were pro-
vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in
the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

a) Step-1: Comparing LWHabmod and GMEPmod (actual accuracies)
b) Step-2: Applying decision rules based on the peat depth, particularly
those affecting wetland/bog classes, to modify GMEPmod data labels.
c) Step-3: Applying decision rules (in addition to Step-2) based on the
Phase-1 Habitat map, and particularly those impacting on the clas-
sification of grassland, heathland, and scrub classes, to modify the
GMEPmod data labels.

These exercises were repeated for the broad habitat classes by

modifying the GMEPBHmod labels through Step-2 and Step-3.

We undertook a dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats,
in Pembrokeshire in 2022 (Fig. 2) using the EarthTrack mobile appli-
cation developed through Living Wales (https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/)

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that vector datasets are utilized, which typically include spatial data such as points, lines, or polygons. These datasets may contain various types of geospatial information, including peat depth maps, phase-1 habitat surveys, digital elevation models, saltmarsh layers, mean high water spring tides, and national forest inventory data. Additionally, the use of the EarthTrack mobile application suggests that GPS coordinates might be collected during field surveys. Based on this information, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline would likely involve some form of geospatial data, but without further details, it cannot be definitively stated whether other formats like images, audio, video, or CSV files are included in the pipeline.
