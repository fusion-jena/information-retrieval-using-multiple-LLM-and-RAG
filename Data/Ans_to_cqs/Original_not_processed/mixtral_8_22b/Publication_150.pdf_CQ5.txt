information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131 
was designed to be faster for mobile devices and thus has the fewest layers of the models compared here. The

Of the four models tested, InceptionV3 presents a good balance between performance and speed. InceptionV3 
had the highest precision and nearly matched Wide-ResNet’s accuracy and recall while being 39% (2.1 ms) faster 
(Table 1). Likewise, InceptionV3 was 5.8 percentage points more accurate than MnasNet while only 0.06 ms 
slower. The speed and accuracy of InceptionV3 makes it useful for web-based and mobile applications that rely 
on both speed and reliable predictions. We therefore focus on our InceptionV3 results for the remainder of this 
paper.

The InceptionV3 model nicely separated species into distinct groupings based on traits extracted from the 
model (Fig. 2). There was little overlap in two-dimensional trait space, which corresponds with the high degree 
of accuracy in the classification results.

MnasNet architecture was obtained by a mobile neural architecture search mechanism that is designed to find 
an optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, one dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database introduced in 2009 during the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition [Deng et al., 2009]. It contains millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories, making it suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models like those mentioned in the context: ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. However, the context does not provide any specific details about how these models were trained or evaluated using ImageNet.
