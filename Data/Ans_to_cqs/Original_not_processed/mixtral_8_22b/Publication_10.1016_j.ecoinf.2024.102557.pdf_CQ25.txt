the  field  of  ecological  informatics  (Borowiec  et  al.,  2022;  Tuia  et  al., 
2022; Christin et al., 2019; W¨aldchen and M¨ader, 2018) and promises to 
continue  to  make  further  progress  (Morera,  2024).  These  techniques 
have  allowed  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  results  compared  to  more 
traditional modeling techniques due to the possibility to approximate 
non-linear  relationships  and  to  consider  a  large  number of  predictors 
(Meyer  et  al.,  2019).  Machine  learning  in  ecology  has  been  used  for 
instance to study species distribution (Liang et al., 2022; Bellin et al., 
2022), species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024), char-
acterization of land use change (Gelabert et al., 2021), identification of 
conservable or restorable areas (Cheng et al., 2018), biodiversity con-
servation and estimation (Tuia et al., 2022; Chang, 2023), and invasive 
species risk assessment (Jensen et al., 2020).

analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the applications mentioned such as studying species distribution, characterizing land use changes, identifying conservable or restorable areas, and assessing risks from invasive species, it can be inferred that the deep learning models could serve various purposes including but not limited to classification, regression, and object detection tasks. Classification tasks might involve categorizing images into different classes like species types or land cover categories. Regression tasks could include estimating continuous variables such as population density or habitat suitability indices. Object detection tasks may involve locating specific objects within images, such as individual animals or invasive plant species. It should be noted that without additional information about the specific models discussed in the sources, this remains an educated guess rather than a definitive statement.
