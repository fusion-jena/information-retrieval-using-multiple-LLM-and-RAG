VGG16 (also referred to as the OxfordNet) (Simonyan and Zisserman, 
2014)  CNN architecture and  was selected primarily due to its  perfor-
mance on the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) dataset.

Table 1 
Overview of Vaki River Watcher sites including the identifier, river type, fish species (17) and range of total body lengths (min 0.05 m, max 1.0 m) observed in the 3000 
videos used for training, testing and validation. Commercial sites (RW_03 to RW_07) are anonymous locations. Fish smaller than 0.05 m were not clearly identifiable, 
and represent the lower size limit considered in the range of body lengths present in the seven sites evaluated. Latin names are included for each fish species after their 
first listing in the table, afterwards only the English name is used.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include a direct reference or link to the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the exact code repository link based solely on the given context. To find the correct code repository, further research would be required by searching online resources such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using relevant keywords from the study.
