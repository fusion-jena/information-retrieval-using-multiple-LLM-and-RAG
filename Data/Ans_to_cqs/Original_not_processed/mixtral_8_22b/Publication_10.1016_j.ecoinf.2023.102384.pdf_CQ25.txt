training step  and  a test  split  with the  remaining eight images  for the 
model evaluation phase. Finally, it is worth noting that, even if we an-
notated only the pests belonging to the class “whitefly”, other insects 
were accidentally stucked in the traps, which represents an additional 
challenge  -  deep  learning  models  should  not  count  the  latter  insect 
species. Specifically, we found insects belonging to different orders, such 
as  Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera,  and  Diptera  (about  21,  7,  and  113, 
respectively);  furthermore,  among  hemipterans  we  also  found  insects 
belonging to families of Psyllidae, Aphidae, and Miridae (about 4, 14, 
and  22,  respectively).  Besides, about  80% of  the  images contain  con-
taminants,  such  as  dust,  fluff,  or  leaves,  accidentally  glued  over  the 
sticky traps. Some samples of bycatches insects and contaminants can be 
found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.

Fig. 3. Generated ground-truth. Ground-truth required for the training phase is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific 
deep learning model PCθ  being employed:: (i) bounding boxes are generated by creating squares centered over the dots with a fixed side length s, (ii) density maps are 
produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels Gσ  centered at the dot positions, and (iii) segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs having 
radius r and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. The parameters s, σ, and r are constants that are established based on the standard object sizes 
prevalent in the images. Best viewed in electronic format.

generator module DG, and (iii) a score-generator module SG. 

The pest counting module PCθ  generates an estimation of the insect 
count within a given Region of Interest (RoI). It utilizes a deep learning 
technique  that  is  trained  by  leveraging  the  data  X .  In  this  work,  we 
implement  PCθ  using  multiple  networks  that  belong  to  the  main 
counting strategies found in the literature. These strategies, as already 
mentioned  in  Section  2.1,  include  counting  by  detection,  where  we 
compute bounding boxes, and counting by regression, where we predict 
a target map. Specifically, for the regression-based approach, we explore 
two  different  methods  that  rely  on  distinct  regressed  target  maps: 
counting by density estimation and counting by segmentation. Density

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily for pest counting within a given region of interest (RoI). This is achieved through the implementation of the pest counting module PCθ, which utilizes various deep learning techniques. The main counting strategies employed here include counting by detection, where bounding boxes are computed, and counting by regression, where a target map is predicted. For the regression-based approach, two different methods relying on distinct regressed target maps are explored: counting by density estimation and counting by segmentation. Therefore, the deep learning model serves the purpose of accurately estimating the number of insects present in the RoI, contributing to efficient pest management practices.
