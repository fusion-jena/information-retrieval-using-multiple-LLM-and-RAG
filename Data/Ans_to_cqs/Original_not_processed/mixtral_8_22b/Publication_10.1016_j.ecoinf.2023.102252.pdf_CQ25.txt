Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that a deep learning model was utilized; however, its specific purpose or application (such as classification, segmentation, or detection) has not been explicitly mentioned. The article focuses on environmental flows, riparian ecosystems, wetlands, and biodiversity maintenance, suggesting that the model might be related to these topics. In Section 6, there is mention of discussing the advantages and limitations of the model and future work, which implies that the model plays a significant role in the research. However, without further information about the model itself, it is difficult to determine its exact purpose or application within this context.
