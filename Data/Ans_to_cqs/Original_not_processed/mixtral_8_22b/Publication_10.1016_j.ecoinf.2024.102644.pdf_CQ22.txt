4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

learning.  AUC  close  to  1  indicates  high  model  quality,  whereas  0  in-
dicates  low  model  quality.  We  used  AUC  to  select  the  optimal  hinge 
features and checked that all models used for species richness estimation 
reached a least a 0.75 AUC. This check contributed to result reliability. 
We  applied  MaxEnt  to  all  our  selected  species  and  environmental 
data (Fig. 3-a). Therefore, we produced 180 models for each of the seven 
analysis years (180 × 7 = 1260 models) (Fig. 3-b and c). We represented

Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using Area Under Curve (AUC) as a measure of model quality, where a value closer to 1 indicates higher model quality. The authors also mention checking that all models reached at least a 0.75 AUC to ensure result reliability. While this is useful information, it does not directly address the query regarding other commonly used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning model apart from the mentioned AUC metric.
