2.7. Machine learning training methodology 

To ensure accuracy and reliability of results, a repeated nested k-fold 
cross-validation approach was employed for all ML models developed 
here. An outer 10 k-fold cross-validation provided an initial division of 
the data into holdout data and data for model development (Molinaro 
et al., 2005). An inner 5 k-fold cross-validation was then used to mini-
mize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results, as 
demonstrated in previous studies (Cawley and Talbot, 2010; Yates et al., 
2022).  The  training  performance  was  calculated  based  on  the  inner 
cross-validated  ensemble,  while  the  testing  performance  was  deter-
mined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire 
training set to predict on the holdout data. This process was repeated 15 
times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance 
related to random sampling (Kim, 2009).

the  primary  hyperparameters  required  for  application  of  the  random 
forest method. Here, hyperparameter optimization was performed using 
Bayesian  Optimization  to  minimize  a  5  k-fold  cross-validation  loss 
during model development (Section 2.7).

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results in machine learning models. This approach can help prevent overfitting by providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, Bayesian Optimization is mentioned for hyperparameter optimization during model development, which could potentially include regularization parameters. In summary, while the context does not directly address the query regarding regularization methods in deep learning pipelines, it does provide information about strategies used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting in machine learning models.
