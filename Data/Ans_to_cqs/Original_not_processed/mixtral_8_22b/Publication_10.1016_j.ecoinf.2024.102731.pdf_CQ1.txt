locating urban heat-prone areas, or determining where the health ben-

To facilitate the use of the tools developed here by non-experts in
their underlying methods, future efforts should be directed toward
automating them as web applications so that users would only need to
make a few open data entries to achieve the desired results. Given the
software environment used in the present study, Shiny would be the
suggested option for this. Other potential lines of research to be devel-
oped include testing the proposed methods under different conditions in
terms of land development and selected mammals as target species.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study uses various types of land cover data such as urban areas, sparse vegetation, croplands, mosaics of croplands and natural vegetation, tree covers, etc. These data could have been collected using remote sensing techniques like satellite imagery, drones, LiDAR, etc. Additionally, the mention of 'open data entries' suggests that publicly available datasets might also have been used. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the study's methodology, it is impossible to definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data.
