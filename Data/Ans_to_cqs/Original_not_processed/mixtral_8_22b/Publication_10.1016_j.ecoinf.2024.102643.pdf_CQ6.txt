Modeling  was  performed  by  generating  1000  random  pseudo- 
absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and 
testing (20%) datasets (Huang et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2021; Salinas- 
Ramos et al., 2021). To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points were 
generated  three  times  for  each  model  and  cross-validated  per  model 
using bootstrapping (Carvalho et al., 2021). We evaluated and compared 
the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the 
receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic) (Araújo and New, 
2007).  True  skill  statistics  value  changes  between  (cid:0) 1  and  + 1,  with 
positive values indicating a perfect fit, while AUC values range from 0.5 
to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive 
power (Fielding and Bell, 1997).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, which scales numeric variables to a standard scale, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1; scaling, which rescales the input features to have zero mean and unit variance; and cleaning, which involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data. These steps help improve the model's performance and convergence speed during training.
