ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. in Ecological Informatics 70(2022)10175716 can be found at https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf. This repository contains an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset, which includes 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. The authors did not train the model directly on the landscape photos but instead used it to infer common objects below the skyline.
