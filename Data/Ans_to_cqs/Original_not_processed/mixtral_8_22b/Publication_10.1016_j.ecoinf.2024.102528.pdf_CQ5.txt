Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two papers related to deep learning models - one for image recognition and another for avian diversity monitoring using BirdNET. It can be inferred that these models might have been trained or tested on relevant datasets, but without explicit information about those datasets, it cannot be determined what they are. Therefore, based on the given context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline remain unknown.
