concentration of atmospheric CO. This model was compared with four 
statistical  models  (ARIMA,  SARIMA,  ETS,  and  HWETS),  one  machine 
learning model (SVR), and one deep learning model (SLSTM) in terms of 
its predictive performance. Model performance was evaluated using the 
MAPE and RMSE metrics. Table 3 presents the average values of these 
metrics for the aforementioned models. The MAPE values of the SGRU 
model were lower than those of the ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, 
and SLSTM models by 67.60%, 55.98%, 79.85%, 55.72%, 42.43%, and 
20.44%,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  accuracy  of  prediction  was 
significantly higher for the SGRU model than for the other models. As 
presented in Fig. 2, the CO values predicted by the SGRU model were 
close to the actual values. Fig. 3 shows scatter plots of the actual CO 
values and those predicted by the ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, 
SLSTM, and SGRU models. Compared with the other models, the deep
