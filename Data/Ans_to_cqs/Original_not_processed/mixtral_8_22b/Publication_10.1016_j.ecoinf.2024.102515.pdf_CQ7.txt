(INDITIC Consortium, 2023). This kind of initiatives would benefit of 
the implementation of the current methodology to reduce human effort. 
Although the usefulness of this methodology has been proven, there 
are still certain limitations that cannot be ignored. The main one cor-
responds to the nature of the tweets themselves, with a low number of 
words  accompanying  the  messages,  not  always  well  written,  which 
makes  it  difficult  to  obtain  useful  information.  This  leads  to  a  high 
number of tweets being lost in the filtering process. Furthermore, using 
exclusively textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset 
would  only  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  deficient  model.  In  addition, 
biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their 
location, allowing, among other applications, to alert about the presence 
of  invasive  species  or  reuse  the  information  in  species  distribution

In this study we have used the ‘Full-archive search endpoint’ to ac-
cess  the  entire  dataset  published  on  Twitter  from  its  beginning  in 
2006–2007 until the end of 2022. To handle the data in JSON format 
returned  by  the  Twitter  API,  we  used  the  twarc2  library  (https:// 
twarc-project.readthedocs.io/).  This  library  simplifies  the  handling  of 
the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API, as well as the pagination 
resulting from a single query. 

The API works by searching for words, hashtags or combinations of 
both  in  the  text  of  tweets,  much  like  the  Twitter  Advanced  Search 
interface  (https://twitter.com/search-advanced?).  To  find  out  how  to 
run the search, in an initial phase of the study, some public tweets with 
observations  were  provided  by  the  social  media  manager  of  the

The  information  retrieved  from  this  social  network,  as  a  general 
characteristic to big data, are defined by a large volume of data and a 
large heterogeneity that requires cleaning and filtering processes that 
allow  focusing  on  relevant  data  (Poorthuis  and  Zook,  2017).  Fig.  1 
shows  a  flowchart  of  the  data  acquisition  and  processing  in  order  to 
reduce  invalid  tweets.  After  the  acquisition  of  original  tweets  (not 
retweets), a first filter consists in eliminating those tweets that contain 
images in GIF format and that in most cases corresponds to memes (http

geographical area and therefore the number of potential tweets is also 
limited,  which  prevents  us  from  making  major  efforts  in  training  an 
image recognition model (e.g. deep learning), something that would be 
very useful if this methodology were extended to larger areas and/or 
more languages, with the subsequent increase in the volume of data.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that due to the limited geographical area and the resulting limitation in the number of potential tweets, the authors did not make significant efforts to train an image recognition model using deep learning techniques. This suggests that they might not have had enough data to effectively use a separate validation set during the training process. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the data splitting methods employed in this study, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
