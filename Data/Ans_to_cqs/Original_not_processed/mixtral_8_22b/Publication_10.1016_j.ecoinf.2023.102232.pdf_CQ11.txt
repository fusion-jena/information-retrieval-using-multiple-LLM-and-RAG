Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Computing tools 

All the calculations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific 
computing centre of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia. The system 
provides  for  two  Hewlett  Packard  Enterprise  (HPE)  ProLiant  DL560 
Gen10 nodes, each one equipped with: four processors Intel Xeon Gold 
5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads; and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes 
worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package 
Ray,  version  1.9.2.  All  the  scripts  and  dataset  to  fully  reproduce  the 
results of this work are publicly available at https://github.com/lucar 
os1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo. 

2.5. Preliminary analysis with perturbed numerical solutions and given 
parameters

A single iteration of the MCMC algorithm provides for the following 
steps.  It  is  selected  a  random  row  of  the  genetic  algorithm  output 
database between [1, nMCMC], and the best parameter values are subse-
quently absorbed. As already described in Section 2.3.1, even in this case 
the  absorbed  parameter  values  are  supposed  to  be  the  mean  of  a 
Gaussian  distribution,  μ,  while  in  this  case  the  associated  variance  is 
defined as a fixed value σ2 = (0.2 μ)2. A random value is generated from 
the Gaussian distribution associated with each parameter by using the 
random.normal() function, then, the ODE system is subsequently solved. 
At the same time, the step provides for absorbing the array of experi-
mental data, allowing the comparison between the ODE model output 
and the experimental data, based on the log-probability value.

Table 1 summarises the overall model parameters considered for the 

Drosophila suzukii case of study. 

To complete the model description, let us consider that in a culti-
vated  field  there  is  a  high  probability  for  males  and  females  to  mate 
(Rossini et al., 2022b, 2021a), that is a transition rate from non-mated to 
mated  females  of  G1→2(t)  = 1  (cid:0) M[T(t)].  Putting  together  all  the  as-
sumptions made, and considering a sex ratio SR  = 0.5 (1:1, males: fe-
males)  (Emiljanowicz  et  al.,  2014)  we  obtain  the  final  version  of  the 
physiologically  based  model  to  test  the  algorithm  introduced  in  the 
following sections:

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, I cannot provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline since it was not mentioned or specified in the provided context. However, according to the information given, the scripts and datasets used to reproduce the results of this work can be found at <https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>. This GitHub repository contains the necessary resources related to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and hybrid Genetic Algorithm used in the research. Please note that this does not necessarily contain the deep learning pipeline, but rather the materials relevant to the computational methods employed in the study.
