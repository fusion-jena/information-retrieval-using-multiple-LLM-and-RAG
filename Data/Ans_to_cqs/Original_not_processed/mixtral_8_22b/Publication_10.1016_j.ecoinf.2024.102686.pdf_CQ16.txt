Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

conditions, climatic, geographic, and vegetation conditions are specified 
as criterion layers (Jin et al., 2016). Each criterion layer includes specific 
indicators and quantitative methods, as listed in Table 1.

large-scale partitioning (Srivastava and Bhambhu, 2005). However, the 
training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets is not ideal at pre-
sent (Amarappa and Sathyanarayana, 2024), and further optimization of 
the  training  algorithm  is  an  urgent  problem  that  needs  to  be  solved. 
Simultaneously, the boundaries delineated by SVM are not uniform with 
the  administrative  boundaries,  and  the  zoning  results  will  face  diffi-
culties in real applications, which is also a problem to be addressed in 
the future. Because of the increasing long-distance HAs and the remote 
deployment of material and energy, the ability of remote connectivity 
will  be  an  important  driver  of  future  regional  differentiation  (J.  Jiao 
et al., 2020). Quantifying this ability and incorporating it into HA–NE 
coupled zoning will be a topic addressed in future studies.

In Eq. (4), η(t) is the learning rate, which decreases with time t, and 

Sk(t) is the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t.

Owing to the characteristics of unsupervised clustering of SOM net-

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning principles, common criteria include reaching a minimum error threshold, achieving a stable validation loss or accuracy over several epochs, or meeting a maximum iteration limit. In the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), one might look for convergence of the objective function or a stable margin between classes. For Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a possible stopping condition could be when the weights no longer change significantly after each iteration. Nonetheless, without more specific details from the authors regarding their chosen methodology, we cannot definitively state what criteria they employed to decide when training was complete.
