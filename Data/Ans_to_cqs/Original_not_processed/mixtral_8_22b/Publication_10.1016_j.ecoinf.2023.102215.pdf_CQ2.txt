networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

2.3. Model training 

Our study can be categorized as a binary classification. We supervise 
TrunkNet’s training with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, 
which  is  a  commonly  employed  loss  function  in  supervised  deep 
learning (Zhao et al., 2019b). The BCE loss function measures the dif-
ference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Mini-
mizing this difference indicates a better training effect. Specifically, the 
BCE loss function in use is expressed with 

L BCE = (cid:0)

∑H

∑W

x=1

y=1

G(x, y)logSpre(x, y) + (1 (cid:0) G(x, y))log(1 (cid:0) Spre(x, y)),

(3)  

where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of 
the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre  is the final pre-
dicted saliency map.

TrunkNet’s  feature  extraction  includes  11  well-configured  MIF
blocks,  which  are  connected  in  an  encoder-decoder  framework  of  U- 
structure.  The  MIF block  is  also  an  encoder-decoder  network  and  in 
particular,  embedded  with  an  attention  mechanism  (the  TA module) 
such that it can well capture multiscale features. The MIF block and the 
TA module will be articulated in later sections. Six MIF blocks, marked 
with EN-i for 1⩽i⩽6 are encoders, while the others, marked with DN-j for 
1⩽j⩽5 are decoders. Encoder EN-6 and all five decoders output a feature 
map each; these output maps form a set of multiscale features, which are 
passed into the feature aggregation part for further processing.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline primarily uses static images and living videos of a commercial orchard, RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard, RGB-images of a single tree branch, RGB-images of urban streets, synthetic images and natural images of forests, and RGB-images of a modern apple orchard. These datasets consist mainly of visual data formats such as images and videos. There is no mention of other data formats like audio, text, or CSV files being used in the given context.
