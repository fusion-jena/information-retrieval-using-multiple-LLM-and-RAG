The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

3.5.3. Artificial neural network 

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. 

3.6. Model fitting and evaluation

Remote sensing encompasses diverse data types such as optical im-
aging, LiDAR, and RADAR. Each data type offers unique advantages for 
estimating  AGB  (Kumar  et  al.,  2015;  Lourenço  et  al.,  2021).  Optical 
remote  sensing  data  from  platforms  such  as  Landsat,  MODIS,  SPOT, 
IKONOS,  QuickBird,  Sentinel-  1  &  2,  and  Worldview  are  available  at 
different spatial and spectral resolutions. Several researchers have used 
optical remote sensing data for AGB estimation (Bolivar-Santamar and 
Reu,  2021;  Ghosh  and  Behera,  2018;  Karlson  et  al.,  2020;  Liu  et  al., 
2022; Pham et al., 2018). Landsat data, particularly over the last two 
decades, have been extensively employed for AGB estimation (Du et al., 
2012; Powell et al., 2010). Optical data predominantly capture the top 
vegetation layer and are sensitive to phenology, climate, and moisture 
content,  which  affects  its  accuracy,  especially  in  densely  vegetated

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that various remote sensing data types like optical imaging, LiDAR, and RADAR were used in estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Specifically, optical remote sensing data from platforms such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT, IKONOS, QuickBird, Sentinel-1 & 2, and Worldview were mentioned. These datasets offer different spatial and spectral resolutions. Additionally, Landsat data, particularly over the last two decades, have been extensively employed for AGB estimation. Therefore, while the exact dataset names used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, we can infer that various remote sensing datasets were utilized for AGB estimation.
