2.3.2. Model development 

We  modeled  the  relationship  between  SOCS  and  environmental 

covariates using a general predictive function: 

SOCSi = f (R, PM, S, Ci, Bi)

(4)  

where R is the topography, PM is the parent material, S is the soil var-
iable, C is the climate, and B denotes the biota variable. 

We used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer percep-
tron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. This algorithm is a type of feedforward 
artificial  neural  network  (Bishop,  1995)  comprising  an  input  layer, 
multiple hidden  layers, and  an output  layer. The  input layer  receives 
features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the 
hidden layer hides the extracted features, while the output layer yields 
the  prediction  results  (SOCS).  Except  for  the  input  layer,  each  layer 
consists  of  a  set  of  individual  nodes  (neurons).  Each  node  connects 
adjacent layers via the activation function. The MLP technique develops

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have utilized a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) for their SOCS modeling. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in this model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. To find these details, one would need access to additional information, such as the source code or further documentation related to the implementation of the MLP model.

It should be noted that the text does mention that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. Additionally, Table 2 is referenced as containing the parameter settings of the MLP model. Unfortunately, without direct access to this table, we cannot provide any further insight into the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
