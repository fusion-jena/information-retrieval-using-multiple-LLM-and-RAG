Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are identified with rectangular boxes; image classification, which involves labeling entire images into categories; semantic segmentation, where each pixel is assigned a class or category; and instance segmentation, which combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects. These techniques help train deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
