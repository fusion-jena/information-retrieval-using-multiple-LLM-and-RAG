datasets.  They  are  not  flexible  enough  to  address  current  open  chal-
lenges unless used purposefully on a narrow task.

This  experiment  used  both  learnable  frontends  with  80  filters  of 
length  512  (16 ms)  that were  initialized  by  mel-filterbanks.  Gaussian 
pooling  was  removed,  and  downsampling  happened  in  the  filtering 
convolution layer by a stride of 320 (10 ms). Then, the outputs were log- 
compressed  without  normalization.  These  plain  frontends  are  called 
LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and Table 4 shows their test results.

It  seems  to  require  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  each  species’  fre-
quency  niche  to  create  optimal  individualized  features.  Yet,  the  most 
celebrated capability of deep neural networks is automatic and task(s)- 
relevant feature extraction while doing the classification task(s) jointly, 
which  has  led  to  unprecedented  achievements  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015). 
Hence, one could ask whether to consider a time-frequency represen-
tation or the waveform as raw input to neural networks to capture all the 
relevant information from bird vocalization. Although the former is the 
prevalent  approach,  data  processing  inequality  indicates  that  post- 
processing can not increase a signal’s information (Beaudry and Ren-
ner,  2011).  Therefore,  the  waveform  is  a  promising  alternative  to 
traditional features derived from it when leveraging neural networks.

trained on these features and found a slight performance improvement. 
However, training a neural network directly on the CQT was, by far, the 
best  choice  among  the  features.  The  other  successful  contemporary 
works  have  explored  various types  of neural networks as  species rec-
ognizers by leveraging Short-Time Fourier-Transform (henceforth STFT 
or  spectrogram)  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021)  and  its  relatives,  such  as  mel- 
filterbanks  applied  on  STFT  (henceforth  mel-spectrogram)  (Zhang 
et al., 2019) and MFCC (Tang et al., 2023) as input feature.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks like object detection (bounding box annotation), semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. However, based on the general practices in machine learning and computer vision, we can infer some possible methods.

In this case, since the research focuses on audio signals, particularly bird vocalizations, the annotations might involve labeling the start and end times of different bird calls within the audio recordings. This process is similar to creating bounding boxes around objects in images but applies to temporal data instead.

Additionally, the researchers may use spectral analysis techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or Constant Q Transform (CQT) to convert the raw audio signals into visual representations, such as spectrograms or mel-spectrograms. In this scenario, they might also perform manual annotation on these visual representations to highlight regions containing relevant bird sounds.

Moreover, the text mentions using deep neural networks for automatic and task-relevant feature extraction. This implies that the researchers likely employed supervised learning approaches, where labeled examples guide the model during training. Consequently, accurate and consistent data annotation becomes crucial for achieving high performance in the final models.
