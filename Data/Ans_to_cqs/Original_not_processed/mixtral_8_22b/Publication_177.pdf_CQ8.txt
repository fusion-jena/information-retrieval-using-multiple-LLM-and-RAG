learning  models  namely  GoogleNet,  ResNet,  and  ResNeXT 
with different configurations [25]. In another study, Ghazi et 
al.  [26]  ensembled  the  results  of  GoogleNet  and  VGG 
networks  to  obtain  an  accuracy  of  80.18%  on  a  validation 
dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. A bagging ensemble of 
three ResNet152-layered CNN networks was used by Šulc and 
Matas  to  obtain  a  performance  of  78.8%  mean  average 
precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset [27].

of 87.8% and 91.2% respectively. A comparative evaluation 
of deep learning models was performed by [20] to identify 109 
plant  species  from  the  28,046  images  collected  online.  The 
results  showed  that  MobileNetV2  emerged  as  the  best 
performing  model  with  an  accuracy  of  83.9%  compared  to 
other models. Unlike the approach of [17],[18],[19], and [20], 
Krause  et  al.  [21]  proposed  a  two-stage  approach  for 
identifying  plant  species  from  the  natural  environment.  In 
their  proposed  method,  the  authors  used  a  deep  learning 
semantic segmentation model to segment the plant from the 
images and then used a multiscale crop of the segmented plant 
to train an Inception-ResNet-V2 model. Using the dataset of 
100  species  with  4,500  training  images,  the  proposed 
approach improved the performance of the model by 5.4% to 
achieve  an  accuracy  of  89.21%.  To  study  the  taxonomic

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various studies and their findings related to plant species recognition using ensemble deep learning techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository based solely on this context.
