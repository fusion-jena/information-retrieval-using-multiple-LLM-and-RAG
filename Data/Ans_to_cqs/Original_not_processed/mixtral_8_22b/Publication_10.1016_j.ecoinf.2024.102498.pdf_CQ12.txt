An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

extract  hierarchical  features  at  various  scales,  encompassing  edges, 
textures, and more intricate elements. By autonomously deriving rele-
vant  features  from  the  data,  deep  learning  eliminates  the  need  for 
manual  feature  engineering  and  reduces  manual  effort.  Furthermore, 
deep  learning  techniques  facilitate  the  generation  of  real-time  LULC 
information.  Recurrent  Neural  Network  (RNN)  models,  in  particular, 
demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns 
continuously. This adaptability enables the model to capture temporal 
shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Transfer learning techniques 
enhance the model's compatibility with new situations or different study 
areas. Additionally, integrating deep learning techniques with the GEE 
platform through the Google Cloud platform allows for dynamic LULC 
mapping by incorporating satellite imagery and real-time observations.

Despite the existing limitations of GEE, the implemented framework 
has yielded favorable results. However, it is worth noting that GEE un-
dergoes  continuous  improvements  and  updates,  and  with  increased 
processing power, it holds the potential to generate even more accurate 
classifications. Considering these factors, it is recommended to employ 
deep learning methods, compare their performance, and integrate the 
models with real-time data to produce dynamic LULC maps. It should be 
acknowledged  that  the  simulation  of  the  scenarios  mentioned  above 
requires a more comprehensive evaluation of the model predictions to 
ensure their accuracy and reliability.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text mentions two types of deep learning models used in the pipeline: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are highly effective for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification due to their ability to extract complex features from satellite imagery. On the other hand, RNNs demonstrate the capability to learn and adapt to changing LULC patterns continuously, capturing temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns.
