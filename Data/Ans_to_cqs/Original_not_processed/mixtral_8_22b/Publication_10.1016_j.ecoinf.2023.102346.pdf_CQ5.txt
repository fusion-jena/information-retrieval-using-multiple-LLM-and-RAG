The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions various software tools and libraries such as QGIS, sdm, dismo, bioclim, biomod2, shiny packages, and RStudio, which are commonly used for geospatial analysis, ecological modelling, and statistical analysis. However, there is no mention of any specific datasets or benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer to this query.
