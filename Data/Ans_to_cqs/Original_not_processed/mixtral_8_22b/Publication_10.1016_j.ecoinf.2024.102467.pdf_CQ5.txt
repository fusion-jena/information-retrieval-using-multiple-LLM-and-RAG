EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

EfficientNetV2 uses the MBConv block from EfficientNetV1. Fig. 2(a) 
shows that the MBConv block is a linear bottleneck layer (Sandler et al., 
2018) with inverted residuals and depth-wise separable convolutions. A 
basic  MBConv  block  consists  of  a  1  × 1  Conv  for  dimensionality 
expansion,  Depthwise  Convolution  (Chollet,  2017),  which  performs 
deep convolution operations on the feature map after expansion with 
either a 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 filter size, SENet (Hu et al., 2018), which en-
hances important channel features and weakens non-important channel 
features, and a 1 × 1 Conv for dimensionality reduction and dropout. 
This block enables the feature extraction network to focus on important 
information  features  and  distinguish  them  from  the  background.  The 
inverted residual structure of this block not only improves the efficiency 
of feature extraction but also reduces the memory required for inference.

on their benthic organism dataset, compared to 93.25% with the orig-
inal  Faster  R-CNN  algorithm  (Liu  and  Wang,  2021).  These  methods 
demonstrate  the  value  of  deep-learning 
for 
aquaculture.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline involving EfficientNetV2. However, it does reference a study by Liu and Wang (2021) where they applied EfficientNetV2 to a benthic organism dataset, achieving higher accuracy than the original Faster R-CNN algorithm. Therefore, one known dataset used in conjunction with EfficientNetV2 is a benthic organism dataset. Unfortunately, without more information about the research conducted by Liu and Wang, we cannot provide details regarding the nature or source of this particular dataset.
