of CNN architectures, and adjust network layers and hyperparameters to 
predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. More-
over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms. 

5. Conclusions

2.3.2. Algal bloom extraction algorithm 

There are many algorithms for extracting algae blooms, including the 
Normalized  Difference  Vegetation  Index  (NDVI)  and  Floating  Algae 
Index (FAI) indexes commonly used in various studies(Cao et al., 2022; 
Luo et al., 2023), as well as algorithms developed for specific areas, such 
as the slope algorithm SAred-NIR using the red band and near-infrared 
band (Ogashawara et al., 2017) and the deep learning algorithm U-net 
model (Feng et al., 2022). This study refers to previous research on the 
reflectance data set of 2000 points of inland lakes in China (including 
Lake Dianchi, Lake Taihu, Lake Chaohu, etc.) and determines that when 
NDVI>-0.1  (Fig.  6a)  or  FAI  > 0.003  (Fig.  6b),  an  algal  bloom  has 
occurred in the corresponding image raster (Fig. 6c) (Pu et al., 2022).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters can be adjusted to predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. Common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and others. Without more specific details from the source material, we cannot definitively state which method was used in this case.
