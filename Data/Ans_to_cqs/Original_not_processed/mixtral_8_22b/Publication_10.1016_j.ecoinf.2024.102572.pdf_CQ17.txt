resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques

• To enhance the “ForestFireArea” image collection with AGB data, it’s 
important  to  recognize  that  the  global  forest  biomass  dataset 
employed  in  this  study  features  a  resolution  of  100  m.  Initially, 
obtain the MODIS projection details using the “ee.projection()” API 
on  GEE.  Then,  implement  the  “ee.reduceResolution()”  function, 
configuring its “reducer” option to “ee.Reducer.mean()” to average 
the values. Ultimately, this process rescales the image resolution to 
500  m,  resulting  in  the  updated  “ForestFireAreawithAGB”  image 
collection.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I can provide some information about these methods. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Dropout is a popular regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst them. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single feature from dominating the model. Other common regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
