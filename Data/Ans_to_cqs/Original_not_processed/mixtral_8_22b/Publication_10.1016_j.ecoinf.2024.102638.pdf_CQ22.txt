2.5. Performance evaluation measures 

Various performance evaluation metrics, i.e., Mean Absolute Error 
(MAE),  Mean  Square  Error  (MSE),  Root  Mean  Square  Error  (RMSE), 
Mean  Absolute  Percentage  Error  (MAPE),  Mean  Absolute  Scale  Error 
(MASE) and Coefficient of determination (R2) have been used to mea-
sure the performance accuracy, and suitability of prediction models. In 
this section, the evaluation metrics used are properly recalled with their 
mathematical rationale (Nagelkerke, 1991).

hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

Table 4 includes details such as the name of the prediction model, its 
hyperparameters,  the  parameters  selected  during  the  5-fold  cross- 
validation,  and  the  hyperparameters  adjusted  according  to  the  selec-
tion  criteria  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  configuration  for  the 
prediction model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not mention a deep learning model specifically but discusses various performance evaluation metrics used to measure the performance accuracy and suitability of prediction models. These include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2). Each metric is defined mathematically in equations (2)-(7) within the given context. However, it should be noted that these metrics are not exclusive to deep learning models and can be applied to any predictive modeling task.
