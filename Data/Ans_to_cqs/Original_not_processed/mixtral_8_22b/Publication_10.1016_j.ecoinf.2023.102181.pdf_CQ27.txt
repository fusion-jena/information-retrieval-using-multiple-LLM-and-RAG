Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model.

approach  described  in  Section  2.4,  using  the  ‘automap’  and  ‘gstat’ 
packages (Gr¨aler et al., 2016; Hiemstra et al., 2009; Pebesma, 2004). 
The sequential simulation algorithm as implemented in ‘gstat’ was used 
to  simulate  500  Gaussian  random  fields,  conditioned  on  the  cross-

enable computation of many simulations, local kriging was used with a 
neighbourhood of 50 points, and random fields were predicted to a grid 
size of 1000 m, denoted s0. To calculate a range of accuracy metrics, the 
residual random field layers ̂R(s0) were transformed to obtain simulated

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform for deployment, and then integrating the serialized model into the chosen platform. This can include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices depending on the use case. Once deployed, the model can receive input data, perform predictions, and return output results. But without more details about the specific scenario, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
