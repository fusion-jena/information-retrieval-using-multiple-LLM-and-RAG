Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Data bias can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models. To address this issue during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This ensures that both sets have similar characteristics, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting due to class imbalance.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with unequal class distributions. Oversampling increases the number of instances from the minority class, either through duplication or synthetic generation of new samples. Undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class, typically by randomly removing examples. Both methods aim to create a more balanced dataset, improving the model's ability to learn patterns from all classes equally.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of data sources and types to ensure that the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. By incorporating diverse data, the model becomes more robust and generalizable, reducing potential biases introduced by limited or homogeneous datasets.

In summary, addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline can involve stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique aims to improve the quality and representativeness of the dataset, ultimately enhancing the performance and reliability of the resulting deep learning model.
