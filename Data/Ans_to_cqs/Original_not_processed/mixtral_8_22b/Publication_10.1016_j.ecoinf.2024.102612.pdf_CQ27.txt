3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3. 

4. Discussion

In the next section, the classifications of the real point clouds will be 
made using the MS-trained model, because it was proven that the model 
in this last experiment outperformed the previous ones, and their fuel 
type classifications will be more reliable. 

3.2. Fuel model retrieval

Regardless of the model type employed for semantic classification, 
training  a  DNN  model  from  scratch  requires  a  substantial  number  of 
training samples to grasp a diverse range of features. The lack of liter-
ature on semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds being pre-
trained  with  synthetic  data  emphasises  the  importance  of  integrating 
augmented  data  simulations  during  the  training  phase  of  DL  models. 
Data augmentation addresses the requirement for large training datasets 
in DNNs, which can be achieved using an external simulator. Current 
research  on  LiDAR  point-cloud  simulations  predominantly  embraces 
two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically ALS, Terrestrial, and 
Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS, respectively) point clouds.

Moreover, enhancements in the classification outcomes of fuel types 
can be achieved using advanced DL classification models that can better 
handle  complex  and  high-dimensional  data  from  MS  geoinformation 
such as LiDAR point clouds or MS imagery. DL is a subfield of machine 
learning that uses Artificial NNs to learn from large datasets and make 
accurate predictions using new data (Sharma et al., 2021). The ability of 
DL models to learn complex patterns and relationships in data makes 
them particularly well-suited for fuel model retrieval, where there are 
often  many  variables  and  relationships  to  consider,  such  as  the  hori-
zontal and vertical continuities of different vegetal species (Skowronski 
et al., 2007). For instance, Kalinaki et al. (2023) used DL models such as 
U-Net  and  Deeplabv3+,  to  semantically  classify  forest  and  non-forest 
features  using  Sentinel-2  MS  imagery.  In  addition,  Marjani  et  al.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model, including details like model serialization or platform selection. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format that allows it to be loaded later for inference purposes. Common formats include.h5,.onnx, or.pb files. Once the model is saved, it could then be deployed onto various platforms depending on the project requirements. These platforms might include cloud services, edge devices, mobile applications, or web servers. Unfortunately, without specific information regarding the deployment process, I cannot provide further details beyond general practices.
