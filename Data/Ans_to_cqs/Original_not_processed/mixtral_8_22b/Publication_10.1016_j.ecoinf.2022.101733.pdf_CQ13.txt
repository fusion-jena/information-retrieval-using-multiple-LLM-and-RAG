according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that an optimizer approach was utilized for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters based on a robust system architecture. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was applied during the development of the model; however, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used.
