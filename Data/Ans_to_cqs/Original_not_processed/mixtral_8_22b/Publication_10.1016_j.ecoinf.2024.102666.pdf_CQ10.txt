artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric
