such  as  land  use  change  for  agriculture  and  afforestation,  road  con-
struction,  and  mining,  could  further  restrict  the  suitable  habitats  of 
ungulates (Ali et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2024).

Connectivity  prediction  was  implemented  in  UNICOR  over  the 
resistance  map  for  the  species  to  find  the  single-source  shortest  path 
between  start  and  end  occurrence  records  (Landguth  et  al.,  2012; 
Cushman et al., 2013). Furthermore, the continuous factorial least-cost 
path map was converted to a categorical map based on the same method 
used  for  core  habitats.  To  measure  the  coverage  of  core  habitats  and 
corridors by CAs, the proportion of these areas within CAs was measured 
(Almasieh and Mohammadi, 2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during training, allowing the model to learn from the data more effectively. Without explicit mention in the given text, it is impossible to determine which technique was employed in this particular case.

Based on the provided context, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on ungulate conservation in Iran, discussing factors such as land use changes, road construction, and mining affecting their habitats. It also presents results related to core habitats, connectivity predictions, and the measurement of core habitats and corridors within Conservation Areas (CAs). Therefore, there is no information available about any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
