The  images  obtained  in  the  UAV  photogrammetry  were processed 
utilizing  the  Pix4Dmapper  software  (Pix4D,  Lausanne,  Switzerland). 
High-resolution DOM (Fig. 3a), DSM (Fig. 3b) and DTM (Fig. 3c) with a 
resolution of 1.5 cm were produced following the processed workflow of 
Song et al. (2016). Subsequently, the image classification tool (Image 
Classification)  in  ArcMap  10.7  (ESRI  Inc.,  California,  USA)  was 
employed to generate the ground cover data. The maximum likelihood 
method was employed to classify the ground cover in the DOM into the 
tree (Pinus sylvestris), bare area and grass. This methodology not only has 
reliable  classification  accuracy  but  is  also  a  common  and  efficacious 
approach for pixel-level image classification (Khatami et al., 2016). A 
confusion  matrix  was  utilized  as  a  metric  to  assess  the  classification 
accuracy.  As  shown  by  Table  2,  the  classification  yielded  an  overall

tained from these UAV-derived DSM, DTM and DOM datasets.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. Specifically, the context mentions the use of high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), and Digital Orthophoto Models (DOMs) derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry. These models are essentially raster or grid-based representations of terrain elevations and surface features, which can be considered as image data. Additionally, the context refers to the use of the Image Classification tool in ArcMap 10.7, further suggesting the involvement of image data in the deep learning process. However, without explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files, it cannot be confirmed if they are part of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
