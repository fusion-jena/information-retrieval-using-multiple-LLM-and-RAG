Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights to automate image segmentation of fishes currently unrepresented within COCO out-of-the-box. Transfer learning allows models to leverage knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve another related problem, which can improve their ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the text discusses the optimization of model weights using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation to reach model convergence, such that the trained neural network generalizes well to novel input data. These techniques contribute to improving the model's capacity to handle diverse datasets and maintain its performance when applied to previously unseen data.
