Table 1 
Type of architecture and accuracy of candidate models and predictive performance of selected models (bold). The accuracy of candidate models was measured using 
the proportion of correctly classified cases. The accuracy of selected models was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

Here we focus on the use of deep learning models as an alternative to 
feature-based  approaches  for  supervised  classification  of  time  series 
data. Deep learning models are a set of recent, complex architectures of 
artificial  neural  networks  (Christin  et  al.,  2019;  LeCun  et  al.,  2015), 
which  have  enabled  significant  advances  of  performance  in  highly 
complex tasks, such as computer vision and natural language processing 
(LeCun et al., 2015). In ecology, the number of studies applying these 
models is growing rapidly, but the vast majority of applications are to 
the classification of image and sound data (e.g. Brodrick et al., 2019; 
Campos-Taberner et al., 2020; Christin et al., 2019; Mac Aodha et al., 
2018; Willi et al., 2019). Accordingly, we wish to draw the attention of 
ecologists to the capacity of deep learning models to classify all kinds of 
temporal data and to several of their practical and conceptual advan-
tages in this regard.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models can be applied to various types of temporal data, which could include formats like time series data, images, sounds, etc. It also discusses the application of deep learning models in ecological studies, specifically for the classification of image and sound data. Therefore, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline discussed here may involve different data formats depending on the type of analysis being performed.
