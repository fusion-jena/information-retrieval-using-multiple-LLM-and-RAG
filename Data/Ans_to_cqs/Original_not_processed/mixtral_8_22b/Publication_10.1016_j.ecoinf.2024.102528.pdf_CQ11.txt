Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

2.2. The Agmon annotated dataset 

We created the “Agmon annotated dataset”  to evaluate the perfor-
mance  of  BirdNET.  The  dataset  comprises  over  10,900  annotated  re-
cordings  of  >75  species.  The  annotations  have  been  carried  out  by

In this study we demonstrated the use of our monitoring pipeline for 
computing  long-term  activity  behavior  of  several  species  recorded 
continuously for over two years in the Agmon Hula Lake Park located in 
the Hula Valley, a major migratory flyway. We generated the Agmon 
annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model. A total 
of 23 species with the highest precision/recall values were selected for 
further analysis. When using automated deep learning models such as 
BirdNET the confidence score can strongly affect the automated iden-
tification  process  (Cole  et  al.,  2022;  P´erez-Granados,  2023).  We 
demonstrated that using BirdNET the relationships between the confi-
dence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific. 
Accordingly,  we  used  species-specific  confidence  thresholds  which 
yielded detection scores that accounts for the precision-recall tradeoff.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline or the Agmon annotated dataset. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to any data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it might be worth reaching out to the corresponding author Y. Lavner via email (yizharle@telhai.ac.il) for more detailed information regarding the availability of the dataset and its location in a public repository.
