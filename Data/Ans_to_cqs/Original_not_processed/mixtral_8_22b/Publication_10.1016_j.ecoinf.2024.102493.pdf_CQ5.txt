2.2. Data sources and processing 

2.2.1. NDVI dataset 

For  our  study,  we  utilized  the  MOD13A2  dataset  from  the  GEE 
platform (Data Catalog: ‘MODIS/006/MOD13A2’) to acquire NDVI data. 
This remote sensing product offers a spatial resolution of 1 km and a 
temporal resolution of 16 days. We collected original images of theMRB 
spanning from January 2001 to December 2020, totaling 460 images (23 
images per year). The preprocessing steps included proportional scaling 
(dividing each pixel’s original value by a scale factor of 10,000), pro-
jection transformations (utilizing the WGS1984-Albers projected coor-
dinate  system),  and  mask  extraction  based  on  watershed  boundaries 
(watershed boundaries extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological 
analysis toolbox), among other procedures. 

2.2.2. Drivers 

We selected 12 drivers related to climate, terrain and human activity 

(Fig. S1; Table 1).

time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine platform for acquiring NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days. Additionally, twelve drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity were also considered in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
