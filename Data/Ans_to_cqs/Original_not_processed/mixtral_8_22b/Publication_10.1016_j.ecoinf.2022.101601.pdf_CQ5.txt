Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on topics related to permafrost, soil properties, vegetation height, solar radiation, thermal conductivity, and other environmental factors. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline from this context.
