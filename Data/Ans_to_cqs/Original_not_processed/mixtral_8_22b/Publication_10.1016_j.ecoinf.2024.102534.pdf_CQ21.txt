data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the data and its ability to generalize to new data.
2. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are a visual representation of the input features that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They provide insights into which parts of the input image have the highest influence on the final decision made by the model.
3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class.
4. Threshold Selection: After obtaining the predicted probabilities from the model, it may be necessary to select a threshold value to convert these probabilities into binary labels (0/1). The choice of threshold depends on the application and the desired tradeoff between false positives and false negatives.
5. Ensemble Models: Sometimes multiple models are trained with different architectures or hyperparameters, and their outputs are combined to improve overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be used for this purpose.
6. Cross-Validation: To ensure that the results obtained are not due to chance, cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can be employed. This involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training/testing the model on different combinations of these folds.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Once the initial set of hyperparameters has been chosen, further tuning can be done to optimize the performance of the model. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., are some commonly used methods for hyperparameter tuning.
