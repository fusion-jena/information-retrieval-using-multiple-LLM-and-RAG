In response to the escalating significance of environmental concerns, 
fostering interdisciplinary integration is crucial for the development of 
innovative and comprehensive solutions. The imperative for educating 
professionals across diverse fields in enhancing dialogue beyond their 
respective  disciplines has never been more pressing. As  landscape ar-
chitects  and  researchers,  we  have  engaged  in  numerous  projects  that 
encompass a broad spectrum of disciplines, acknowledging the pivotal 
role of soil science within various ecological systems. Through collab-
oration with experts in disciplines such as soil science, ecology, water 
management, and urban planning, we have recognized the need for a 
coherent communication approach that efficiently conveys information 
across  these  fields.  Accordingly,  this  paper  proposes  a  visualization 
system utilizing computational algorithms to streamline the visualiza-

retrieved  local  climate  data,  envisions  potential  avenues  to  exploit 
existing  remote  sensing  data  and  web-based  APIs.  For  instance,  the 
utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US 
soil moisture data can be beneficial. This could lead to the development 
of integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at 
varying degrees of granularity. Not only would this augment the inter-
operability of our system, but it would also foster enhanced multidis-
ciplinary  communication  at  the  developmental  stage,  consequently 
bolstering  collaborations  across  fields.  Nevertheless,  the  prospect  of 
identifying a unified data framework with global applicability remains 
uncertain to us.

distribution, providing  a  valuable overview for  targeted users or  pro-
fessionals. However, little  research focuses on projects at  the scale of 
building, landscape, or urban block. Resource distribution at such scales 
does  not  vary  significantly  geographically  but  varies  considerably  at 
different depths within the soil. The collected data is limited and does 
not  differ  substantially  on  geographic  maps.  Furthermore,  multidisci-
plinary collaboration across various disciplines is more intense between 
different parties within these projects.

The  majority  part  of  the  BeingAliveLanguage  has  been  developed 
using the C# language within Microsoft’s.NET Framework and is inte-
grated  into  Rhino’s  plugin  ecosystem.  The  plugin  can  be  installed  on 
Rhino v7 + utilizing its build-in package management system. 

In  terms  of  computational  complexity,  the  two  most  resource- 
intensive  processes  are  building  the  soil  map  and  simulating  root 
growth. By making appropriate choices for data structures (Hash map 
and K-d tree) and leveraging parallel computing, we have successfully 
reduced  the  computational  complexity  to  an  O(nlogn) level.  Our  ex-
periments  demonstrate  that  constructing  a  soil  map  containing 
approximately  1  million  vertices  takes  less  than  10s  on  a  modern  i7- 
8550U  laptop  with  16  GB  RAM.  Generating  diagrams  at  a  moderate 
scale allows for almost instantaneous feedback and enables an interac-
tive design process.
