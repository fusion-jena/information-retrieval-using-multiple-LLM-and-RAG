Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing techniques involving both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from sources like Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. These types of data can be considered as images or raster data for processing purposes. Additionally, the text refers to several data transformations such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT), and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, which are typically applied to multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. Therefore, based on this context, we can infer that the primary data format used in the described workflow is likely to be image data.
