Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.
