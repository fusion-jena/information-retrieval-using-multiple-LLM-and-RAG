3.4. Performance evaluation 

The classification performance of the proposed model EMViT-Net is 
assessed by calculating the precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of the 
model as these are the most popular performance evaluation indicators. 
The precision defines the ratio of true positive to all positive predicted 
samples.  The  sensitivity  is  also  known  as  recall  which  defines  the 
number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples 
and the f1-score is a general indicator of precision and recall. The ac-
curacy  of  a  model  can  be  measured  by  calculating  the  ratio  of  true 
positive and true negative to the overall collected samples. Here true

3.5. Evaluated results of EMViT-Net

To further validate the performance of the proposed model EMViT- 
Net,  the  acquired  findings  were  compared  with  other  state-of-the-art 
models. The performance measures used to compare the performance 
of  EMViT-Net  with  other  deep  learning  models  are  evaluated  on  the 
validation set and test set of the considered dataset EMDS-6. The com-
parison of the classification results achieved by other pre-trained deep 
learning models is given in Table 4 and Table 5 which illustrates the 
finding on each set validation set and test set respectively by calculating 
the  average  value  of  precision,  recall  and  f1-score  for  all  categories 
which are named as Avg_Precision, Avg_Recall and Avg_F1-score. The 
detailed analysis of the proposed network EMViT-Net and other deep 
learning models with specific configurations on unseen test sets is out-
lined  here  which  shows  that  the  EMViT-Net  outperforms  precision,

for  different  deep 

While test accuracy for all the considered networks DenseNet 121, Alex 
Net, ViT, ResNet50, Xception Net, VGG19, InceptionV3 and VGG16 are 
33.77%,  35.87%,  37.65%,  41.58%,  44.76%,  48.57%,  48.88%,  and 
50.15% respectively. It has been observed that on the test set the per-
formance of every model was lower than the validation set performance, 
While the performance of the model on the test set demonstrates how 
well the model can generalize. After seeing these results, it would be 
worth  noting  that  the  proposed  transformer-based  neural  network 
EMViT-Net achieves the highest classification accuracy with a validation 
accuracy of 71.17% and test accuracy of 67.62% while requiring lesser 
training time and performing faster than the other models.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model EMViT-Net is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. These metrics are commonly used to assess the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is calculated as the number of correct positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives. The F1-score is a measure of both precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both factors. Accuracy is determined by dividing the sum of true positives and true negatives by the total number of instances. In this case, the EMViT-Net model achieved a test accuracy of 67.62%.
