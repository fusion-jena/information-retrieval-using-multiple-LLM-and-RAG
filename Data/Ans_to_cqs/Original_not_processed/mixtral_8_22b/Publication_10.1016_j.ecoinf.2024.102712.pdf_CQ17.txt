bined with other types of data in an efficient, for example in a model- 
assisted framework (e.g., Ståhl et al., 2016) or hierarchical modelling 
(e.g., Saarela et al., 2016, 2018).

We evaluated the model performance utilising leave-one-out cross- 
validation, (LOOCV) approach. In the LOOCV approach, one observa-
tion at a time is extracted from the dataset and the model parameters are 
estimated  using  the  remaining  (n-1)  observations.  The  model  is  then 
applied to the extracted observation. 

3. Results 

The  GEDI  data  and  the  available  field  data  did  not  coincide 
geographically or in size. Thus, we have compared the GEDI L4A AGBD 
footprint values with AGBD estimated from the Sentinel-2 models. We 
also compared the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field 
data and GEDI data, respectively to understand the relationship between 
GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field based 
values at the two study area.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies among them. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. Early stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing. Batch normalization scales inputs to each layer to improve convergence speed and stability. These techniques can be applied individually or combined to achieve better results.
