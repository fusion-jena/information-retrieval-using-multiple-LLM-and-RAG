number of output filters per convolution layer is 32 for the first one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the final one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and the softmax layer with the number of units for classification (one for each type of sound).

ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

At the classiﬁcation stage, there is a tendency in the literature to consider semi-
automated PAM analysis [5]. One of the most interesting approaches is focused on the
use of modern digital image processing techniques for audio pattern identiﬁcation. This
strategy creates an image that represents the audio energy of a certain record in a time
and frequency graph. Deep learning algorithms are run using these images [6–9]. This
constitutes a data fusion technique easy to implement in low power and computation
resources nodes. This way, the classiﬁcation method can be done in a distributed manner,
avoiding sending the audio data records through the network links, thus minimizing
network power consumption. The following section describes this approach.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio data for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for anuran call classification. However, it also mentions creating an image representation of the audio energy in a time and frequency graph, which implies that the actual input format for the CNN might be images rather than raw audio files. Therefore, both audio and image data formats are involved in the deep learning pipeline.
