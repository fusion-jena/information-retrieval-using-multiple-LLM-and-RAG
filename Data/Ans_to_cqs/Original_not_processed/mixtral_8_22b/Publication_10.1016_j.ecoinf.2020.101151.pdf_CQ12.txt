Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km.
The nine-cell approach, the results of which are shown in this paper, led
to slightly better prediction results of the variants, likely because it
smoothed existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

burned area and the classification of forest fire cases into danger classes
according to the different variants. For the linear regressions, we only
used forest fires with a burned area greater than or equal to 0.1 ha
(n = 22 in 2018; n = 26 in 2019), to filter out the numerous small fires.

2.5. Vegetation

For our analysis, we used 135 forest fires from the year 2018 (an-
nual total 172) and 195 forest fires from 2019 (annual total 235). We
did not include other vegetation fires in this study. We compared the
number of correct predicted forest fires given by the FFMC, the FWI and
all mentioned variants. A correct prediction was defined as a fire oc-
curring in the danger classes 3 (moderate), 4 (high) or 5 (very high). A
wrong prediction was defined as a fire occurring in the danger classes 1
(very low) or 2 (low). Since the mean localization error for documented
forest fires is several hundred meters, and due to assumed inaccuracies
in the data layers used, we decided to compare two approaches: First,
we analyzed the 100 × 100 m grid cells where ignition points of forest
fires were located. Second, we analyzed the 100 × 100 m grid cells
together with the surrounding eight cells, leading to a 300 × 300 m
data grid. This procedure was only implemented for the variants, not

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer regarding the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
