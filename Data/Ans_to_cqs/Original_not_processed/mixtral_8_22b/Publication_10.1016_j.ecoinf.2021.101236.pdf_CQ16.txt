schedule  whenever  the  validation  loss  stalled.  This  also  included  a 
step-wise reduction of dropout probabilities by 0.1, starting at an initial 
probability of 0.5. Early stopping with a cooldown of 3 epochs prevented 
overfitting. We started with a maximum amount of 500 sample spec-
trograms  per  class  and  increased  that  amount  by  1000  whenever 
training was finished—pre-trained snapshots were used to initialize the 
weights. Finally, an approach of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 
2015) was used to train a born-again network (Furlanello et al., 2018) 
using  the  best  previous  snapshot  as  a  teacher.  Doing  so  helped  to 
improve the overall performance even though the capacity of the model 
remained unchanged. We did not experiment with ensemble techniques 
due to the high computational demand and the respective lack of real- 
world  applicability  despite  their  popularity  for  this  kind  of  task.  Our

et al., 2014; Northcott, 2014). However, the large number of training 
and test recordings often forced participants to reduce the amount of 
data used to extract features due to computational constraints. The de-
ficiencies of low-level feature classification restricted significant prog-
ress, and the need for more advanced classifiers became apparent.

With its ~27 million trainable parameters, the model has sufficient capacity to 
classify  984  bird  species  and  three  non-event  classes.  Like  Schlüter  (2018) 
proposed in his work, the classification block employs time-step predictions and 
log-mean-exponential pooling to preserve scores across multiple intervals. 
BN = Batch normalization, DO = Dropout, LME = Log-mean-exponential.

implementation of this data augmentation method.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that training is considered complete when the validation loss stalls or plateaus. Additionally, early stopping is employed with a cooldown period of 3 epochs to prevent overfitting. These two methods together help ensure that the model does not continue training once it has reached optimal performance on the validation set.
