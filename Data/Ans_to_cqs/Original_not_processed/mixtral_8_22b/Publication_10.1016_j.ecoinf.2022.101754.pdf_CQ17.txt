2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

learning techniques (e.g., random forest [RF], support vector regression 
[SVR], and k-nearest neighbor [kNN]) are capable to reveal complicated 
nonlinear patterns (Fassnacht et al., 2014) and, in addition, to solve data 
dimensional  problems  when  fitting  models  with  a  large  number  of 
predictors (Hudak et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019). The variety among 
research  sites,  however,  corresponds  to  equal  variety  among  those 
predictors and machine learning methods used. Therefore, there is no 
agreement to  date  on best  practices  for machine  learning methods  to 
estimate AGB from ALS. In a review, Fassnacht et al. (2014) reported 
that RF performed best and stepwise linear models poorest, as judged by 
coefficient  of  determination  (R2)  and  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE) 
under  cross-validation.  Tompalski  et  al.  (2019)  generated  area-based 
models using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), RF, and kNN to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the focus of the research is on estimating forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using various machine learning methods such as AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). However, none of these sources explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines. Regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but without more information about the specific implementation details of the models used in this research, we cannot definitively state which regularization methods were employed.
