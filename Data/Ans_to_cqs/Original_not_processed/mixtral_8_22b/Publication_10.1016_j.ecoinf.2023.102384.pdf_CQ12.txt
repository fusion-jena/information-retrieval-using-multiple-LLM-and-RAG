training step  and  a test  split  with the  remaining eight images  for the 
model evaluation phase. Finally, it is worth noting that, even if we an-
notated only the pests belonging to the class “whitefly”, other insects 
were accidentally stucked in the traps, which represents an additional 
challenge  -  deep  learning  models  should  not  count  the  latter  insect 
species. Specifically, we found insects belonging to different orders, such 
as  Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera,  and  Diptera  (about  21,  7,  and  113, 
respectively);  furthermore,  among  hemipterans  we  also  found  insects 
belonging to families of Psyllidae, Aphidae, and Miridae (about 4, 14, 
and  22,  respectively).  Besides, about  80% of  the  images contain  con-
taminants,  such  as  dust,  fluff,  or  leaves,  accidentally  glued  over  the 
sticky traps. Some samples of bycatches insects and contaminants can be 
found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.

odologies for pest detection and counting, as mentioned in Section 2.2. 
Notably, many of these methodologies employ the same deep learning 
network, such as Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2017), which is adopted in 
constructing the PCθ  module. Some other approaches, like (Bereciartua- 
P´erez et al., 2022; Bereciartua-P´erez et al., 2023) inspired by FCRN (Xie 
et al., 2016), and others like (Rustia et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2018; Wang 
et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2018), which utilize similar architectures to 
(Tian et al., 2019), are also considered. Summarizing, this section aims 
to demonstrate, over the newly established scenario represented by the 
PST dataset, the effectiveness of our counting pipeline; taking advantage 
of  the  latter  being  model-agnostic,  we  test  several  general  counting 
strategies that also enclose primary SOTA pest detection and counting 
approaches, performing an in-depth counting analysis.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that various deep learning networks have been employed in constructing the pipeline, including Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network) (Ren et al., 2017). Additionally, some methods use Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) (Xie et al., 2016) as inspiration. These examples suggest that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily utilized in the pipeline. However, the specific architecture may vary depending on the approach taken, as evidenced by the mention of multiple strategies and architectures.
