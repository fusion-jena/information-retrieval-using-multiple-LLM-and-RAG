Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some aspects can be inferred from the available information.

Firstly, it appears that the data used for the study includes a diverse dataset, as mentioned in the context ("online shared videos that contain a wide range of species richness"). This diversity could contribute to the robustness and generalizability of any machine learning models developed from this data.

Secondly, while not explicitly stated, the use of a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis suggests a rigorous approach to selecting relevant features for modeling. This process could help improve the model's performance and potentially its generalizability.

Lastly, although not directly related to ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model, the citation of various sources indicates a comprehensive review of existing literature, which is essential for developing well-informed and reliable models.

However, without explicit details about the application of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is impossible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
