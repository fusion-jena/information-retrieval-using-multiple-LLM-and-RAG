(0–0.335),  medium 
formance  classes  were  considered:  poor 
(0.336–0.665), and good (0.666–1).

3.3. Model validation 

SDMs showed an excellent level of predictive performance, as indi-
cated by the AUC and TSS values of 0.91 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard de-
viation) and 0.68 ± 0.02 in H. guttulatus and 0.92 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ±
0.03 in H. hippocampus. 

The  high predictive  performance of  our  models was  confirmed by 

validation using multiple databases (Table 2). 

3.4. Niche analysis 

The first and second principal component of the ecospat PCA of both 
species explained 35.4% and 22.2% of the variability in the study area, 
respectively  (Figs.  4a-g).  The  correlation  plot  showed  that  the  mean
