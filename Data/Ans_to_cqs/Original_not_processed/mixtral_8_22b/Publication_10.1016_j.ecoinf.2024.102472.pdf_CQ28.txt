XGBoost is a powerful algorithm for estimating carbon stocks, but it 
is not immune to overfitting. By comparing its performance to ANN, we 
can gain deeper insights into its resilience against overfitting and other 
potential forms of model bias. This study provides a readily replicable 
methodology that uses field inventory and remote sensing multispectral 
data and machine learning. According to literature, a limited number of 
studies have tested the utility of the Planetscope eight band high reso-
lution image under reforested urban landscapes. Hence, we examined 
the efficacy of Planetscope data coupled with vegetation indices, texture 
features and terrain variables in retrieving carbon stock estimates over a 
reforested  urban  landscape  in  South  Africa  using  ML  models  i.e., 
XGBoost and ANN.

The accuracy of the predictive models based on Planetscope imagery 
surpasses  that  of  similar  models  in  comparable  environments  (Jiang 
et al., 2021,). Notably, the XGBoost based carbon stock predictive model 
demonstrates  the  most  precise  predictions  as  compared  to  ANN,  as 
indicated by the lowest RMSE (27.33 t. ha-1 and 29.75 t. ha-1) based on 
calibration and validation. This highlights its superiority in estimating 
carbon stocks. However, ANN also demonstrated accuracy though its R2 
was lower (R2: 0.77 to 0.73) than XGBoost and RMSE slightly higher 
RMSE (28.17 to 30.44 t. ha-1) and MAE (22.39 to 24.43 t. ha-1). This is 
consistent  with previous studies that have reported the superiority of 
XGBoost over ANN. For instance Ramdani and Furqon (2022) found that 
XGBoost had the lowest RMSE value (1.56) compared to ANN (4.33), 
Random Forest (6.81), and Support Vector Machine (7.45) in the clas-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given sources to determine which specific cloud platform or deployment environment was used for the deep learning models mentioned in the research papers. None of the cited works explicitly mention the use of platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for their experiments. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the platform used to deploy the deep learning models.
