Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

Machine learning methods: Modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest 
of Brazil

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it mentions that Random Forests (RF), one of the machine learning techniques discussed, trains each tree on a random subset of the data. This implies that some form of splitting or partitioning of the dataset occurs during the training process. Typically, datasets are divided into training, testing, and sometimes validation subsets to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. Common criteria for this division include using a fixed percentage of the total data (e.g., 70% for training, 30% for testing) or employing cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. Without more specific details from the given context, these general practices can be assumed to apply.
