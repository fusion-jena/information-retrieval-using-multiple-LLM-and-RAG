of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

discrepancy without further data. Finally, the best models for transfer learning on new data domains often do not 
agree  with  those  selected  by  the  standard  training/validation/testing  scheme.  Our  findings  pave  the  way  for 
deeper discussions and further investigations into the limitations of CNN models when applied to high-resolution 
imagery.

Pre-trained  networks  offer  architectures  with  various  convolution 
operations that allow them to extract patterns within the images effi-
ciently.  After  the  convolutional  layers  of  pre-trained  networks,  it  is 
necessary to add a fully connected network architecture, also known as 
multi-layer perceptron. These layers are usually located at the end, and 
are responsible for reproducing the predictions of the final output. We 
compared different fully connected network architectures, exploring up 
to  three  hidden  layers  with  8,  16,  32,  and  64  neurons  in  each  layer. 
Consequently,  we  generated  12  models  for  each  dataset  trained  with 
different fully connected architectures. The output layer consisted of a 
single  neuron  with  a  sigmoid  activation  function,  producing  invasion 
predictions between 0.0 and 1.0.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several clues that suggest the use of image data. Firstly, the text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Secondly, the authors discuss the extraction of patterns within images using convolutional operations. Lastly, they refer to the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or fully connected network architectures, which are often employed after convolutional layers in image classification tasks. Therefore, based on this context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data.
