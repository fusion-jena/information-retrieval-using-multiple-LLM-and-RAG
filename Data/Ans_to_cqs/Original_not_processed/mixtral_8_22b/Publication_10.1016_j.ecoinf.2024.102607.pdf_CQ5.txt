In addition to selecting the RS imagery and representative training 
samples, the choice of machine learning (ML) algorithm directly affects 
the accuracy of the classification results. Currently, a wide range of ML 
algorithms are extensively employed in LULC mapping, including sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) (Adugna et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2017), 
random forests (RFs) (Svoboda et al., 2022), decision trees (DTs) (Shih 
et al., 2018), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Amani et al., 2020; 
Hu et al., 2021). Researchers have frequently compared the accuracies 
of LULC maps derived from different classifiers (Shih et al., 2021). The 
RF  classifier  outperformed  the  other  ML  classifiers,  as  confirmed  by 
LULC (Shih et al., 2018; Yuh et al., 2023) and crop mapping (Inglada 
et al., 2015). RF has lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and stronger 
robustness against noise (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). Furthermore, RF can

image presegmentation. This retains the benefits of object-based clas-
sification  while  eliminating  time-consuming  parameter  adjustments 
required by traditional segmentation methods. Furthermore, it is worth 
highlighting that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform. 
This indicates that it can be easily applied to other regions or different 
study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC 
classification tasks. In future studies, the sample and vegetation index 
feature datasets should be continuously optimised. Furthermore, we will 
incorporate CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into the study of 
LULC mapping in arid zones.

The  utilisation  of  remote  sensing  (RS)  technology,  along  with  the 
abundance of freely available satellite images (such as MODIS, Landsat, 
and  Sentinel),  has  shown  promising  outcomes  in  LULC  classification 
mapping  at  various  scales, ranging  from  global  to  local (Campos  and 
Brito,  2018).  Currently,  there  are  multiple  datasets  available  offering 
different spatial resolutions for China and the globe, including CNLUCC 
(Xu et al., 2018), CLCD (Yang and Huang, 2021), Globeland30 (Chen 
et  al.,  2015),  FROM_GLC30  (Gong  et  al.,  2012), ESA-CCI_LC  (Radoux 
et al., 2014), MCD12Q1 (Chirachawala et al., 2020) and ESRI_ Land_-
Cover_2020 (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). However, variations in the initial 
definitions of the classification criteria and algorithms have led to un-
certainty regarding the consistency and accuracy of these datasets at the 
regional scale (Hou et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2021). This uncertainty can

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses several datasets related to remote sensing (RS) technology and land use/land cover (LULC) classification mapping. These include MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel, CNLUCC, CLCD, Globeland30, FROM\_GLC30, ESA-CCI\_LC, MCD12Q1, and ESRI\_Land\_Cover\_2020. It also mentions the application of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, sentinel imagery, and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada. However, without further information, I cannot provide a more detailed response about the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
