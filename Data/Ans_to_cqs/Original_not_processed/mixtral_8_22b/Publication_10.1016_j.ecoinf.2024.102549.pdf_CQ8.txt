CNN represent a cornerstone in the realm of deep learning (Zhou, 
2020),  setting  themselves  apart  from  traditional  machine  learning 
techniques  such  as  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM),  Random  Forest 
(RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Unlike these methods, CNN excel 
in  processing  high-dimensional  imagery,  capturing  intricate  patterns 
and  abstract  features  crucial  for  sophisticated  interpretation  and  pre-
diction tasks (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020). This capability renders 
CNNs particularly valuable in environmental studies, enabling precise 
estimations of cyanobacteria levels and the identification and classifi-
cation of various algal species (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020; Yadav 
et al., 2020).

Water quality monitoring in inland lakes is crucial to ensuring the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. For 
regional  water  environment  agencies  and  researchers,  remote  sensing  offers  a  cost-effective  alternative  to 
traditional in-situ water sampling methods. In this study, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
based on AlexNet to represent the relationship between Sentinel-2 images and in situ water quality levels of Lake 
Dianchi from November 2020 to April 2023. The model incorporated an algal bloom extraction algorithm and 
utilized correlation analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and random forest (RF) method to establish connec-
tions between two environmental factors: water quality and meteorology, to the area of algal bloom (AAB). The 
findings  revealed an  improvement  in Lake  Dianchi's water  quality, with  Levels  A (good water  quality) and B

distribution of algal blooms, this study leverages remote sensing data in 
conjunction  with  CNNs,  applying  the  AlexNet  architecture  to  water 
quality classification to address the challenges posed by the heteroge-
neous water conditions in Lake Dianchi. Additionally, our research is 
distinguished  by  its  integration  of  a  broader  range  of  environmental 
factors, including both meteorological and water quality parameters, to 
assess their collective impact on algal bloom formation. This multifac-
eted analysis offers a more nuanced understanding compared to Wang 

et al. (2021c), who primarily focused on the response relationship be-
tween  algal  blooms  and  environmental  factors,  providing  a  more 
detailed insight.
