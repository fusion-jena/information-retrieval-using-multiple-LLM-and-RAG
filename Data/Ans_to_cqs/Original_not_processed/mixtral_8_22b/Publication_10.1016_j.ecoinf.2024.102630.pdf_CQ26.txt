2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the selection of suitable NDVI products is crucial due to distinct strengths and weaknesses associated with different datasets. Researchers need to consider factors like spatial resolution, temporal coverage, and quality assessment when choosing appropriate NDVI products for their studies. Therefore, while the text does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines, it emphasizes the importance of selecting relevant and high-quality data sources for ecological analyses using NDVI datasets.
