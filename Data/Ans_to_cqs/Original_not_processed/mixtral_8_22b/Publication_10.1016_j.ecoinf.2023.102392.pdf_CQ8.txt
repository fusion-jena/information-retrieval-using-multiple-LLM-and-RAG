have  demonstrated  that  deep  learning  models  perform  well  in  object 
recognition and categorization (Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020). In 
particular, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has gained 
popularity  due  to  its  ability  to  identify  features  and  patterns  in  large 
image datasets (Friedman, 2001; Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Neverthe-
less, the application of deep learning models to detect and categorize 
forest  types  utilizing  high  spatial  and  ultra-high  resolution  remote 
sensing data is still uncommon (Georganos et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
risk of forest fire is also affected by the features of the forest condition 
(Reich et al., 2001). During dry weather, the forest states with numerous 
oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves will burn more quickly 
than in other forest conditions (Doran et al., 2004; Ebright et al., 2023; 
Hardison,  1976).  As  a  result,  reliable  forest-type  categorization  is
