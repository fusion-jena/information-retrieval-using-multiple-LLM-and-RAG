“environmental  pollution,”  “surface  water  pollution,”  “air  pollution,” 
and  “groundwater  pollution”;  and  2)  “landfill,”  “enterprise,”  “tailings 
pond,” “site,” “company,” and “factory.” Tweets containing one or more 
keywords  from  both  aspects  were  returned.  Detailed  descriptions  of 
these data have been provided by Jiang et al. (2022a). In total, we ob-
tained 9399 original tweets, with Anhui Province, Zhejiang Province, 
Jiangsu  Province,  and  Shanghai  City  having  numbers  of  672,  2283, 
2701, and 3743, respectively (Fig. S3). From 2011 to 2021, the distri-
bution of numbers was 136, 423, 892, 818, 713, 993, 955, 1309, 1333, 
905, and 922. Data crawled from microblogs were preprocessed before 
use (Liu et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2022). Steps included checking the 
information source, observing the propagation model, looking for lan-
guage  vulnerability,  and  screening  message  content.  Detailed  pre-

processing instructions can be found in Text S1. The final available data 
elements totaled 6802.

Previous studies mainly focused on the spatial location of the sites, 
while neglecting the probability of site pollution (Wang et al., 2022; Wei 
et al., 2022). For example, Jia et al. (2019) used machine learning to 
identify  potentially  contaminated  sites  based  on  unstructured text  in-
formation  such  as  company  names  and  latitude  and  longitude  infor-
mation from Google’s interest points in the Yangtze River Delta region. 
Tang et al. (2020) obtained 5189 tailings ponds and their spatial dis-
tribution  characteristics  in  China  based  on  multiple  sources  of  infor-
mation  such  as  government  publications,  scientific  literature,  online 
news, and field investigations. However, few studies have analyzed the 
probability of site pollution. In this study, we obtained the emotions and 
spatial locations of public opinions on contaminated sites. Our results 
indicated that all municipal administrative regions in the study area had
