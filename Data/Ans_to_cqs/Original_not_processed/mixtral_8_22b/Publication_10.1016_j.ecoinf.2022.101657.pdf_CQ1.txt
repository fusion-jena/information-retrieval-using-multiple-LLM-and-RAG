7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights. 

7.1.4. Low power neural networks in hardware

Recently,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  has  been  brought  to  some 
commercial camera traps, such as the Trail-Guard by Resolve, although 
literature around effectiveness for this is lacking. The use of AI “at the 
edge” may be able to overcome some of the issues of traditional camera 
traps, such as a large number of empty images being kept for analysis 
and  later  discarded.  More  specifically,  machine  learning,  especially 
based  on deep  learning techniques, is  being explored by  the research 
community to reduce as much as possible the amount of useless data 
being  collected.  For  example,  Schindler  and  Steinhage  (2021)  use  a 
combination  of  Mask  R-CNN  with  Flow-Guided  Feature  Aggregation 
(Zhu et al., 2017) to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in 
video clips. Their study is applied to data obtained by camera traps with 
PIR,  capturing  at  dusk  and  night,  in  Bavaria,  four  classes  of  animals

In the world of camera trapping for biodiversity monitoring one of 
the  greatest  problems  is  the  large  quantity  of  data  that  is  generated. 
Many of the captured images do not even contain any animals, and so 
significant time needs to be spent on simply removing empty images. 
Large  advances  have  been  made  in  this  regard,  especially  with  the 
introduction  of  Machine  Learning  (ML)  into  this  field  (Tabak  et  al., 
2019; Wei et al., 2020; Xi et al., 2021). The standard approach is one of 
retroactively  removing  empty  images.  We  propose  a  solution  where 
instead our camera trap system does not capture empty images in the 
first  place.  Some  advantages  of  our  approach  include  reducing:  (i) 
bandwidth  requirements  if  live  data  is  sent;  (ii)  storage  requirements 
when  saving  data  to  disk;  and  (iii)  assessment  time  at  later  stages  of 
analysis. We provide the open-source code for the camera trap, docu-

Helpful Answer:
The primary method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for camera trapping in biodiversity monitoring is through the deployment of camera traps in various regions. These devices automatically capture images when they detect motion or heat signatures using Passive InfraRed (PIR) technology. However, many of these captured images often do not contain any animals, leading to significant time spent on removing empty images. To address this issue, recent advancements have introduced Machine Learning (ML) techniques into this field.

One notable development is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into commercial camera traps like the Trail-Guard by Resolve. This allows for AI processing "at the edge," which can help mitigate some challenges associated with traditional camera traps, such as storing and analyzing numerous empty images. Researchers are also exploring deep learning techniques to minimize the collection of unnecessary data. For instance, Schindler and Steinhage (2021) employed a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017) to enhance instance segmentation of animal species in video clips captured by PIR-equipped camera traps during dusk and nighttime hours in Bavaria.

Additionally, there are tools available to assist researchers in identifying empty images within their dataset, such as Zilong (Wei et al., 2020) and Image Filtering and Labelling Assistant (IFLA) (Xi et al., 2021). These resources enable users to quickly remove irrelevant images, streamlining the data preprocessing phase before training deep learning models.

In summary, the main method for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline for camera trapping involves deploying camera traps equipped with PIR technology. Recent developments focus on integrating ML and AI techniques to improve image quality and reduce the volume of empty images stored and analyzed. Tools like Zilong and IFLA further aid researchers in efficiently managing their datasets prior to model training.
