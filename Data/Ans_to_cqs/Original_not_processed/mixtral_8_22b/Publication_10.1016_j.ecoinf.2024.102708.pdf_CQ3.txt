2.4. Deep learning models 

Two  widely  used  object  detection  models  were  selected  for  com-
parison, YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2021) and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN) (Ren 
et al., 2015). YOLO is a lightweight approach where objects are identi-
fied directly through as single pass, whereas the FR-CNN is a multi-stage 
network approach based on identifying potential regions and then cat-
egorising and discarding some inappropriate regions (Ren et al., 2015). 
For the YOLOv5 model, we also tested three variants, YOLOv5 small, 
YOLOv5  medium  and  TPH-YOLOv5  (Zhu  et  al.,  2021b),  which  is  a 
modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH) 
(Yang et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use object detection models, namely YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), for detecting Pacific oysters in drone images. Object detection involves localizing and classifying objects within an image, typically using bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks. Given this information, it is likely that the authors employed either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation during the data annotation process.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around each object of interest in an image, along with labeling the corresponding class. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, such as those performed by YOLOv5 and FR-CNN. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves creating pixel-level masks for individual instances of objects within an image. While more time-consuming and complex than bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides more precise object boundaries and can better handle overlapping objects.

Without explicit confirmation from the paper, it remains uncertain whether the authors utilized bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or both for their data annotation needs. Nonetheless, given the nature of the task and the chosen models, it is reasonable to assume that one or both of these techniques were employed.
