In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various 
fields  due  to  its  powerful  ability  to  handle  non-linear  relationships 
(Mohammadi et al., 2023), according to previous surveys, an increasing 
number of studies are attempting to use ML methods to estimate WQP. Li 
et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate 
Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data 
from 2017 to 2019; the results indicated that this model is suitable for 
lakes  with  medium  to  low  Chla  concentrations  (Li  et  al.,  2021). 
Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean 
Color  Network  (OGN)  to  estimate  Chla  concentrations  in  the  Barents 
Sea,  in  comparison  to  Gaussian  Process  Regression,  this  network 
demonstrated  a  5.2%  reduction  in  mean  absolute  error  (Asim  et  al., 
2021). Ensemble learning (EL) is one of the key technologies in the field

RF is the first algorithm selected as a representative of the bagging 
algorithm family, Random Forest (RF) is the first algorithm we selected 
(Breiman,  2001).  Taking regression  as  an example,  its  core idea  is  to 
construct multiple weak learners in parallel and ultimately output the 
result as the average of the weak learners to enhance model accuracy. In 
addition,  we  chose  several  Boosting  algorithms.  The  GBDT,  improves 
upon the initial boosting algorithm by introducing the concepts of fitting 
residuals and sampling (Friendman, 2001). XGBoost, built upon GBDT, 
it  incorporated  a  structural  risk  term  into  the  loss  function  L(y,y ˆ), 
forming the objective functionO(y,y ˆ), XGBoost also introduced a novel 
impurity measure metric, which considers complexity in splitting rules 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Additionally, it employs new tree-building 
processes, such as estimation greedy algorithms, parallel learning, and

Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

The EL algorithms demonstrate superior performance and high ac-
curacy, but its drawback lies in the inability to uncover the relationships 
between input features and output results, thus lacking interpretability 
for the prediction outcomes, such models are often referred to as black- 
box models. With the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence 
(XAI),  methods  like  Local  Interpretable  Model-Agnostic  Explanations 
(LIME) and SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) have been applied to 
explain  black-box  models  (Lundberg  and  Lee,  2017;  Ribeiro  et  al., 
2016). LIME focuses on providing local explanations, that is, it attempts 
to  explain  the  model’s  behaviour  around  a  specific  input  data  point, 
whereas SHAP does not have this limitation. SHAP, originating from the 
concept of cooperative game theory, is employed to ascertain the con-
tributions of each collaborator to a cooperative task. It offers the capa-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the study. However, considering the overall theme of the text, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been used for estimating or predicting water quality parameters (WQP), specifically chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations. This assumption is made because the context mentions other machine learning models being used for similar purposes, such as the SVM model by Li et al. and the OGN model by Muhammad et al. Furthermore, the context discusses various WQP inversion algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, suggesting that they may have been utilized for the same goal. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning model mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated what its exact purpose was (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.).
