centers) in the development of the system is an essential task for out-
reach, dissemination and operationalization of the system. In this
context, we will ask a selected group of experts for feedback on the
performance, usability and reliability of the system in spring 2020. A
future use of the IFDS could also be the integration into a decision
support system, similar to the approach of Kalabokidis et al. (2013).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that a selected group of experts was asked for feedback on the performance, usability, and reliability of the system in spring 2020. This suggests that some form of monitoring or evaluation of the model's performance may have been conducted during its development. Additionally, the reference to integrating the IFDS into a decision support system, similar to the approach of Kalabokidis et al. (2013), implies that there might be established methods or best practices for evaluating and validating such models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the specific strategies used to monitor the model performance during training, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
