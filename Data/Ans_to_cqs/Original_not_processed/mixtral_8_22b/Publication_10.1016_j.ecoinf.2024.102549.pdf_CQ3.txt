CNN has different architectures, such as Le-Net, Alex-Net, Res-Net, 
CapsuleNet, High-Resolution Networks, etc. (Kattenborn et al., 2021). 
This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep 
CNNs  proposed  by  Krizhevsky  et  al.  (2012),  applied  successfully  in 
image scene classification tasks (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021d). 
AlexNet's  triumph  is  attributed  to  practical  strategies  like  ReLU 
nonlinear  layers  and  dropout  regularization  techniques,  making  it 
effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent 
for handling complex problems (Han et al., 2017). Compared to other 
CNN models (e.g., VGG and ResNet), the AlexNet model has a simpler 
structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train 
and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex 
problems (Pu et al., 2019).

CNN represent a cornerstone in the realm of deep learning (Zhou, 
2020),  setting  themselves  apart  from  traditional  machine  learning 
techniques  such  as  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM),  Random  Forest 
(RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Unlike these methods, CNN excel 
in  processing  high-dimensional  imagery,  capturing  intricate  patterns 
and  abstract  features  crucial  for  sophisticated  interpretation  and  pre-
diction tasks (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020). This capability renders 
CNNs particularly valuable in environmental studies, enabling precise 
estimations of cyanobacteria levels and the identification and classifi-
cation of various algal species (Gu et al., 2018; Pyo et al., 2020; Yadav 
et al., 2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label or tag datasets with meaningful metadata, allowing algorithms to learn from them effectively. For example, bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images, while instance segmentation requires outlining each object individually. The choice of technique depends on the type of dataset and the problem being solved.
