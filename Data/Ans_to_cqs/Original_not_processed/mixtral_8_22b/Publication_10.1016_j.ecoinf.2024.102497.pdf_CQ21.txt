The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Helpful Answer:
After training a Random Forest Regression (RFR) model for nearshore bathymetry studies, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the most important features used by the model to make its predictions. They help identify which input variables had the greatest impact on the output, providing insights into the underlying patterns in the data. For example, in the case of nearshore bathymetry studies, saliency maps could reveal which spectral bands were most influential in determining water depth.

Calculating metrics is another crucial step in evaluating the performance of the trained RFR model. Commonly used metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, while RMSE provides a more robust measure of error by penalizing larger deviations. R^2 indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model, with higher values indicating better fit. By comparing these metrics across different models or hyperparameter settings, researchers can determine which configuration yields the best performance.

Finally, confusion matrices can also be generated to assess the classification accuracy of the RFR model when applied to categorical outputs. A confusion matrix summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, broken down by class label. This allows for easy identification of any systematic biases or misclassifications in the model's predictions.

In summary, postprocessing steps after training an RFR model for nearshore bathymetry studies may involve generating saliency maps, calculating metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R^2, and creating confusion matrices to evaluate classification accuracy. These analyses provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the trained model, enabling informed decisions about its deployment and further refinement.
