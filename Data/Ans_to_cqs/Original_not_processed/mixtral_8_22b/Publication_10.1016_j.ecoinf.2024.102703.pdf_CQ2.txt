2.2. Field sampling and sample collection 

Four  field  campaigns  were  conducted  in  November  2018,  and 
January, April, and July 2019, under clear weather conditions except in 
July. A total of 119 water samples were collected (Fig. 1). Surface water 
(0.5 m depth) was gathered using clean polyethylene bags and promptly 
transported to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were categorized 
into two groups: one portion was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter 
for water quality parameter analysis, while the other was prepared for 
CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. This involved filtering through a 
◦
C, 3 h) Whatman GF/F filter and a 0.2 μm Millipore 
precombusted (450 
filter, followed by storage in 150 mL acid-washed amber glass bottles.

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided about the water samples being analyzed, we can infer that the data format used might be numerical or tabular data such as CSV files. These could contain various water quality parameters like pH, water temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, Chl-a, DOC, etc. Additionally, there may also be some form of spectrometric data related to CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. But without explicit mention of the use of images, audio, or video data, it cannot be confirmed if these formats are part of the deep learning pipeline.
