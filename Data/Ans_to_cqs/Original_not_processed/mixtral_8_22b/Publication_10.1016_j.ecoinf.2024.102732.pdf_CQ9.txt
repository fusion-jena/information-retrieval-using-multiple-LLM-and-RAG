%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context. It would be necessary to consult additional sources or contact the authors directly to obtain this information.
