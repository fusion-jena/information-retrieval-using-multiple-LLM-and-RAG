features  from  images,  comprising  three  convolutional  layers:  Con-
v+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggre-
gation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). As  an 
efficient aggregation network, the ELAN layer is designed with a multi- 
stream  structure  to  learn  various  features  through  different  convolu-
tional  streams. Unlike  the normal  pooling layer,  the  MPConv layer  is 
branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer. Features extracted from 
each layer were fused through the Concat operation, facilitated by the 
aggregated feature pyramid structure. With the SPP pyramid structure, 
the header network is designed for multiple inputs and transferring in-
formation from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is 
utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given information, we can infer that some form of visual data such as images or videos are utilized. For instance, the text mentions "features from images" and discusses methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are typically applied to image data. Furthermore, there is reference to detecting mammals in UAV images and actions in wildlife videos, suggesting the use of visual data. Therefore, while the exact format isn't specified, it appears that image or video data is likely being employed within this deep learning pipeline.
