Helpful Answer:
The research paper utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include field surveys, remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. Additionally, satellite images and publicly available datasets are also used.

Field surveys involve direct observation and measurement of variables in their natural settings. This method is employed to gather information about the study area, including its geographical features, vegetation patterns, and other relevant characteristics.

Remote sensing techniques provide valuable data from a distance without physical contact with the object or area being observed. LiDAR technology uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. It is used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and three-dimensional representations of the Earth's surface. UAV-based LiDAR systems offer advantages over traditional airborne platforms due to their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to capture detailed data even in complex terrains.

Hyperspectral and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data are also collected using UAVs. Hyperspectral imaging captures the spectrum of each pixel in an image across a wide range of wavelengths, providing detailed information about the materials present in the scene. Ultrahigh-resolution RGB data refers to images captured with very high spatial resolution, allowing for precise identification and analysis of objects within the images.

Publicly available datasets and satellite images are another source of raw data. These datasets often contain large volumes of historical and real-time data, which can be useful for training machine learning models and validating results. Satellite images provide global coverage and regular updates, making them ideal for monitoring changes over time.
