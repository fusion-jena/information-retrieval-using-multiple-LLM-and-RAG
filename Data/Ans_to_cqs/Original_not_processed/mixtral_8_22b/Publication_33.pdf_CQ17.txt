The proposed post-processing was able to decrease the misclassification rate by at least 10.05%, for all goals, 
and 19.02% at most compared to the raw output of the Deep Learning model (Fig. 6b). The accuracy followed the 
same tendency, with an average accuracy for G1, G2 and G3 respectively equal to 0.74, 0.81 and 0.92 (Table 3).
Finally, we also performed the same experiment while switching T1 and T2 roles (Supplementary Tables S6, 
S7, S8). For each goal, the unsure classification rate was higher after the switch (+ 3.8% for G1, + 4.4% for G2, 
and + 8.9% for G3), implying lower scores were obtained in both correct classification (− 3.5%, − 5%, − 7.3%) and 
misclassification, with the exception of the 2nd goal (-0.2%, + 0.6%, − 1.6%).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference the concept of preventing overfitting through stopped training, which is mentioned in source number 45 ("Stopped training and other remedies for overfitting" by Sarle, W. S.).

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting during the training process of a deep learning model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data rather than generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps mitigate this issue by adding constraints to the learning process, making the model more generalized and improving its ability to perform well on new data.

Two common regularization methods include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly deactivating a certain percentage of neurons during each iteration of training, forcing the remaining neurons to adapt and become more resilient. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing complexity in the model.

While these specific regularization methods aren't explicitly discussed in the provided context, they remain important tools for combatting overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
