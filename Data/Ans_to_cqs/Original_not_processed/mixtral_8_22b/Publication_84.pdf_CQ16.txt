1.4. Objectives

The parameter setting method of SVM in this study was done ac-
cording to the sensitivity analysis method in (Heydari and Mountrakis,
2018). The “kernelType” was set to “RBF” (Gaussian function). For the
“gamma” parameter in the RBF kernel, we tested values of 0.01, 0.1,
0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300. For the “cost” parameter in SVM,
we tested values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. We randomly se-
lected 50% reference data for parameter optimization. By selecting the
highest overall accuracy achieved from diﬀerent parameter combina-
tions, this study set “gamma” and “cost” to 2 and 10 respectively.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't a direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be related to the number of iterations or epochs during training. In Table 3, it is mentioned that the "# of iterations" parameter has been set to a range between 7132–9756. This suggests that the model might have been trained until reaching a certain iteration count, rather than using other stopping criteria such as early stopping or convergence of validation loss. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the chosen criteria, it can only be speculated that the training process may have continued until the specified maximum number of iterations was reached.
