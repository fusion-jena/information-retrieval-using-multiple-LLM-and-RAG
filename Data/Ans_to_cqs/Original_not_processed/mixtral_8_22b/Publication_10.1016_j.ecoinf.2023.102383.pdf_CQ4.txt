compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

characterized  by  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  are  being 
increasingly  used  to  automate  the  animal  recognition  and  counting 
tasks, and their performance is continuously improved with the intro-
duction of enhanced architecture (Kaur and Singh, 2022). For example,

Deeper layers derive additional features from the output of shallower 
layers  through  progressive  downscaling.  Consequently,  feature  maps 
from shallower layers contain more spatial feature information due to 
higher resolution, while those from deeper layers have more bands and 
may  provide  more  abstract  semantic  feature  information.  However, 
when dealing with small objects containing only a limited number of 
pixels, the vital spatial information about these objects can potentially 
be lost in the deeper layers as part of the downsizing process, which may 
not  only  fail  to  contribute  to  detection  process  but  can  also  diminish 
detection precision. Additionally, to ensure that the predicted RoIs align

For deep learning-based object detection, two fundamental elements, 
feature  maps  and  anchor  boxes,  play  critical  roles.  Feature  maps  are 
extracted from original images and utilized to identify potential objects 
of  interest  and  locate  their  rough  positions  within  an  image.  Subse-
quently, anchor boxes come into play for generating regions of interest 
(RoIs)  and  facilitating  bounding  box  regression,  which  enables  the 
refinement of RoIs to better match the bounding box of the objects of 
interest. In the general definition of CNNs, the CNN layers that are closer 
to the input layer are called shallower layers, while deeper layers are 
those more distant  from the  input  layer. In the  architecture of  object 
detection,  various  CNNs—such  as  ResNet18,  ResNet34,  ResNet50, 
ResNet101, and ResNet152—differ in the overall depth of their layers. 
These CNNs are used to extract feature maps from the original imagery.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are often employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of training datasets and improve the robustness of models. These techniques involve applying transformations to existing images to create new ones. However, without explicit information on this topic in the provided context, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding the application of data augmentation techniques in the mentioned deep learning pipeline.
