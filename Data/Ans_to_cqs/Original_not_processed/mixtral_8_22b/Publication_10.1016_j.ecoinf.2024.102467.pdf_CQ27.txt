EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Googleâ€™s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically after training a deep learning model, it needs to be serialized into a format that can be used for prediction or inference. This usually involves saving the weights and architecture of the model into a file using a standard format such as HDF5 or ONNX. Once the model has been serialized, it can then be deployed onto a platform suitable for its use case. For example, if the model is being used for real-time object detection, it may need to be deployed onto a GPU-enabled device capable of handling high throughput video streams. Alternatively, if the model is being used for batch processing tasks, it could be deployed onto a cloud-based platform such as AWS SageMaker or Azure Machine Learning Studio. Ultimately, the choice of deployment platform will depend on factors such as cost, scalability, latency, and security requirements.
