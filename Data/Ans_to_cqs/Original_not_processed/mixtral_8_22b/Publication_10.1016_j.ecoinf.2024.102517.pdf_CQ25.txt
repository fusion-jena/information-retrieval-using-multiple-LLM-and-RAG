2.3.3. Experimental setting 

In our experiment, a deep learning environment based on Python and 
Tensorflow – GPU as well as CUDA was constructed under the Windows 
operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network 
model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam 
(cid:0) 4. In each 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10
epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one 
noisy bird sound signal per iteration. 

2.4. Comparative algorithms 

Using the same test  set, we compared the  denoising results of the 
deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several 
other  bioacoustics  noise  reduction  algorithms,  namely  SEGAN, 
WebRTC, wavelet transform (Priyadarshani et al., 2016), Wiener filter 
(Loizou, 2017), and MMSE STSA (Brown et al., 2017) algorithms.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the text that the model is designed for bird sound noise reduction. Specifically, the model is referred to as a "bird sound noise reduction network" and is mentioned alongside other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA. Additionally, the model uses deep feature loss to train the network, which suggests that its goal is to minimize the difference between the processed bird sound signals and their corresponding clean versions. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the model is not directly specified, it appears to be intended for reducing noise in bird sounds, likely for applications related to ecology or conservation research.
