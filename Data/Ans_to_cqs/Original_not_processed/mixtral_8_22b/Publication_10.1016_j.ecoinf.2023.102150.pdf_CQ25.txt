To overcome the challenge of manually processing huge amounts of 
data, artificial intelligence is increasingly used in ecology, for example 
to  automate  the  classification  of  camera  trap  images  (Christin  et  al., 
2019). Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning models that 
have proven to be especially useful for image recognition (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012) and have been applied for animal detection and classifi-
cation with great success (e.g. Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 
2019; Willi et al., 2019; Zualkernan et al., 2022). These models can for 
example separate empty images from images containing an animal (e.g. 
Beery et al., 2019), identify species, count individuals, and categorize 
animal behaviour with an accuracy that matches or even outperforms 
humans (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). However, developing and training 
neural  networks require  programming  skills  and  have  therefore  often

We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

Fig. 3. The camera trap developed by Soininen et al. (2015) consists of a Reconyx camera that is mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small 
mammals. The camera traps are protected with stones when placed in the field.

The complete workflow is performed in the statistical software R (R 
Core Team, 2022), a programming language used by most ecologists (Lai 
et  al.,  2019).  Thus,  the  use  of  R  instead  of  python,  the  leading  pro-
gramming language for deep learning tasks (Raschka et al., 2020), will 
likely  lower  the  threshold  for  ecologist  of  implementing  automatic 
image classification in their workflows. Most available frameworks for 
automatic  image  classification  come  as  tools  with  a  graphical  user 
interface or as R packages. Such tools and packages are designed to be 
user-friendly with the aim to make machine learning models available 
for  ecologists  without  programming  experience  (Tabak  et  al.,  2020). 
However,  they  are  often  difficult  to  modify  and  researchers  are  then 
obliged to develop their own tool for their specific needs instead of using 
existing ones. Thus, we provide R-scripts for all steps of the workflow,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely used for image classification. This is suggested by the mention of its application in separating empty images from those containing animals, identifying species, counting individuals, and categorizing animal behavior. Additionally, the model architecture used, ResNet50, is commonly employed for image classification tasks. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the primary purpose of this deep learning model was image classification.
