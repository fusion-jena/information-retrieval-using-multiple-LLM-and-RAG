(INDITIC Consortium, 2023). This kind of initiatives would benefit of 
the implementation of the current methodology to reduce human effort. 
Although the usefulness of this methodology has been proven, there 
are still certain limitations that cannot be ignored. The main one cor-
responds to the nature of the tweets themselves, with a low number of 
words  accompanying  the  messages,  not  always  well  written,  which 
makes  it  difficult  to  obtain  useful  information.  This  leads  to  a  high 
number of tweets being lost in the filtering process. Furthermore, using 
exclusively textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset 
would  only  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  deficient  model.  In  addition, 
biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their 
location, allowing, among other applications, to alert about the presence 
of  invasive  species  or  reuse  the  information  in  species  distribution

2. Methodology

a species observation must first know the monitoring network or pro-
gram to which he/she wishes to enrol and then send the data via email,

This study gathered tweets from the beginning of the series until the 
end of 2022. For this reason, it was necessary to supervise ~11 K tweets. 
Despite  this,  the  supervision  took  less  time  than  expected,  as  the 
spreadsheet  also  embedded  a  thumbnail,  allowing  the  taxonomist  to 
review  dozens  of  entries  per  minute  by  scrolling  through  the  spread-
sheet. Only when there was a species of interest was it necessary to stop 
the  procedure  to  annotate  the  category.  With  the  retrospective  study 
completed, running the algorithm daily or integrated into an alert sys-
tem means checking a bunch of tweets a day at best. This makes it still a

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details on the specific strategy used for monitoring the model performance during training. However, based on the available information, we can infer some aspects related to the model development and evaluation processes.

The study focuses on gathering tweets containing biodiversity observations and uses them to create a training dataset. It mentions that using exclusively textual information from tweets may result in a deficient model, suggesting that additional features might have been incorporated to improve its performance.

Regarding the monitoring aspect, the context describes a manual verification process where a taxonomist reviews the collected tweets and annotates categories of interest. This implies that the model's performance could potentially be monitored by comparing its predictions against these manually verified labels.

Additionally, the context discusses the need for location information alongside species observations to ensure meaningful analysis and application. While this doesn't directly address the query, it suggests that spatial data might play a role in the overall modeling approach.

In summary, while the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training isn't explicitly stated, the context indicates that manual verification and possibly incorporating additional features like spatial data are part of the broader methodology.
