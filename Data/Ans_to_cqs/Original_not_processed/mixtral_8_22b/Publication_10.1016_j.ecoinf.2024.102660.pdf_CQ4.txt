network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

2.5. Parameter setting 

The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. 
The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory, along with 
an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the 
network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, 
flips,  and  other  image  augmentation  operations  to  enhance  the  net-
work’s robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size 
set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate 
was  adjusted  using  the  equal-interval  adjustment  strategy  (StepLR), 
halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

original  dimensions.  The  right  portion  of  Fig.  3(a)  represents  the 
decoding stage, where convolutions and upsample operations are con-
ducted  from  level  5  to  level  2,  to  restore  the  feature  map  size  to  its 
original  dimensions.  During  this  stage,  the  upsampled  feature  map  is 
concatenated with the sun glint features from the corresponding level in 
the  encoding  stage  along  the  channel  dimension.  Subsequently,  the 
concatenated feature undergoes processing through the Convolutional 
Block  Attention  Module  (CBAM)  mechanism  (Woo  et  al.,  2018),  as 
shown in Fig. 4, to recombine the sun glint features in both channel and 
spatial  dimensions.  Afterward,  two  additional  convolutional  feature 
extraction operations are performed to complete the decoding process 
for that level. At the final level of the decoding stage, the upsampled 
level 2 decoding feature is connected with the level 1 encoding result.

sun glint, this study reduces the number of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels 
in the convolutional block from 64 to 32, a measure taken to mitigate 
overfitting.  Additionally,  a  residual  structure  is  incorporated  into  the 
ResConv block based on the ResNet network (He et al., 2016). This in-
volves a series of operations: 3 × 3 convolution, batch normalization 
(BN),  rectified  linear  unit  (RELU)  activation  function,  followed  by 
another  3  × 3  convolution,  BN,  and  element-wise  addition  with  the 
output  of  the  initial  3  × 3  convolution.  Subsequently,  the  resulting 
feature map undergoes a secondary RELU activation function to obtain 
the convolutional feature results. Fig. 3(c) shows the Upsample block, 
responsible for restoring the feature map’s size to twice its original di-
mensions, comprising consecutive upsample, 3 × 3 convolution, BN, and 
RELU activation function operations.
