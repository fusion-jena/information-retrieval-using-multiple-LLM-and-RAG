Fig. 5. Network structure for supervised learning of the fish factor (FF) with all 
measured  variables  as  predictors.  The  latent  FF  comprised  the  manifest  vari-
ables from corals, sponges and gorgonians.

The MWST-learned network was used for the final clustering of each 
group  of  variables.  The  connections  between  nodes  for  different  taxa 
variables  were  first  removed  so  that  only  within-taxon  connections 
remained (Fig. S2). The number of factors requested for variable clus-
tering was chosen based on the number of taxa. Multiple clustering was 
used to construct a new latent factor variable for each taxon, generating 
multiple  cluster  states  within  each  latent  factor  variable.  These  four 
latent variables were then themselves clustered to create a higher-level 
latent factor variable, a meta-cluster, that summarized the cluster states 
across  taxa.  This  meta-clustering  provides  a  hierarchical  clustering 
network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from 
the measured variables across taxa. This network also includes all factor 
nodes  and  observable  nodes  from  monitoring  data  so  it  provides  an

Maximum weight spanning tree (MWST) structure learning was used 
to  gain  additional  insights.  The  MWST  is  considered  a  tree  structure 
because it is constrained to only one parent node per child node. The 
MWST starts off by examining the strength of the relationships between 
the nodes and connects them by prioritizing the strongest relationships. 
The direction of the arcs is automatically chosen to minimize structural 
complexity (Bayesia S.A.S., 2010). The MWST networks were built using 
a  score-based  determination  from  the  minimum  description  length 
(MDL)  (Conrady  and  Jouffe,  2015).  The  MDL  contains  two  compo-
nents—one for the representation of the data and one for the complexity 
of  the  network.  The  complexity  term  is  given  a  weight,  known  as  a 
structural  coefficient  (SC).  When  the  SC  is  1,  the  terms  are  balanced 
equally between complexity and data representation. When the SC is >1,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, specifically the paper titled "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming" by Do, A.N.T., and Tran, H.D., published in Eco. Inform. 78, 102380, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely related to object detection or pattern recognition. However, without access to the full text of the article, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific type of task the deep learning model performs. Nevertheless, considering the title and the fact that many deep learning models are employed for tasks such as image analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition, it is reasonable to assume that this particular model might be utilized for similar purposes.
