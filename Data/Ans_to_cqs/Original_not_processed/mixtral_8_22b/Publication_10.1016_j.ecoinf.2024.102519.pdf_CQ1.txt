Note: (a) Water yield classification based on the natural break method; (b) carbon storage classification based on the natural break method; (c) soil conservation 
classification based on the natural break method; (d) food supply classification based on the natural break method (Jenks). The natural break method can group 
similar values most appropriately and maximize the differences between different classes.

Helpful Answer:
The study by X. Wu et al. utilizes various types of data from multiple sources to analyze ecosystem services in the Weihe River Basin. These data include Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil data, population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meteorological data, vector data, and statistical yearbooks.

For spatial data such as DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, and meteorological data, remote sensing techniques using satellite imagery or airborne sensors are commonly used to collect this information. Remote sensing allows for large-scale data collection over vast areas with high temporal resolution. For example, Landsat satellites provide free access to multispectral images with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, which is suitable for regional studies like the one conducted by X. Wu et al.

Additionally, ground-based measurements using sensors can be employed to gather more detailed and accurate data on specific parameters such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. In situ measurements are often necessary to calibrate and validate remotely sensed data.

Publicly available datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or research institutions, can also serve as valuable resources for obtaining relevant data. For instance, the WorldClim database offers global climate layers with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 kilometer, while the Harmonized World Soil Database provides soil property maps at a similar scale.

Lastly, survey data collected through questionnaires or interviews may be used to supplement other forms of data. Surveys can help researchers understand human perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors related to environmental issues, which could influence decision-making processes regarding ecosystem management and conservation efforts.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for analyzing ecosystem services in the Weihe River Basin employs several methods for gathering raw data, including remote sensing techniques, ground-based sensor measurements, publicly accessible datasets, and survey data. Each method has its advantages and limitations, making it essential to carefully consider their applicability depending on the specific requirements of each study.
