dictions to the total number of positive predictions. This metric indicates 
the  proportion  of  positive  predictions  correctly  classified  as  positive. 
Recall  shows  the  proportion  of  truly  positive  cases  that  the  model 
correctly identified among all the actual positive cases. The F1 score is a 
geometric mean of both precision and recall criteria. This metric offers a 
more robust evaluation, mainly when there is an imbalance in the data 
distribution  among  classes.  Each  metric  mentioned  above  provides 
unique insights into the model's performance. Consequently, conducting 
a comprehensive review of these metrics contributes to a more precise 
evaluation of the overall performance of the model.

where  ̂yi  and  yi  are  the  predicted  and  measured  values  of  the  target

Depending  on  the  strategy  used  for  LULC  classification,  including 
pixel-based  and  object-based  approaches,  various  ML  models  were 
implemented and evaluated during warm and cool seasons. The results

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model can be evaluated using several metrics, each providing unique insights into its effectiveness. These include Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, indicating the proportion of correct positive classifications. Recall calculates the proportion of truly positive cases that the model accurately identifies out of all actual positive instances. The F1 Score combines both Precision and Recall by taking their harmonic mean, offering a more balanced assessment, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. By examining these metrics together, one can achieve a more accurate understanding of the overall performance of the deep learning model.
