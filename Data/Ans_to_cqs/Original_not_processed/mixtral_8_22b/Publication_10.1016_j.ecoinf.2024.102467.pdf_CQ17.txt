EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

quirements are even larger when training with high-resolution images. 
BoTNet uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information and 
low-resolution  feature  maps  before  inputting  them  for  self-attention, 
thereby  avoiding  excessive  memory  and  computational  resource  con-
sumption. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the BoTNet.

EfficientNetV2 uses the MBConv block from EfficientNetV1. Fig. 2(a) 
shows that the MBConv block is a linear bottleneck layer (Sandler et al., 
2018) with inverted residuals and depth-wise separable convolutions. A 
basic  MBConv  block  consists  of  a  1  × 1  Conv  for  dimensionality 
expansion,  Depthwise  Convolution  (Chollet,  2017),  which  performs 
deep convolution operations on the feature map after expansion with 
either a 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 filter size, SENet (Hu et al., 2018), which en-
hances important channel features and weakens non-important channel 
features, and a 1 × 1 Conv for dimensionality reduction and dropout. 
This block enables the feature extraction network to focus on important 
information  features  and  distinguish  them  from  the  background.  The 
inverted residual structure of this block not only improves the efficiency 
of feature extraction but also reduces the memory required for inference.

Helpful Answer:
While the given context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of regularization methods in the EfficientNetV2 network. According to the text, EfficientNetV2 employs an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. However, the exact nature of these regularization methods is not specified. Regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the learning process. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, helping to avoid complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging weights to be small, thus reducing complexity and improving generalization. It should be noted that without explicit details about the regularization methods employed in EfficientNetV2, we cannot definitively state whether they include dropout or L2 regularization.
