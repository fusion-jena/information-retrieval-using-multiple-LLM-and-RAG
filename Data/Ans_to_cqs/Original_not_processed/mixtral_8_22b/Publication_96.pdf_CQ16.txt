The  algorithm  includes  two  steps:  training  and  prediction.  In  the 
training phase, the following parameters where defined, based on tests: 
the  learning  rate  (0.001),  the  batch  size  (1,000),  the  number  of  in-
teractions  (7,000),  and  the  inputs  for  classification  were  the  spectral 
data acquired from the training samples of spectral bands defined based 
on the burned and non-burned areas. The following Lansat-8 spectral 
bands were used for the classification model of burned areas: red (RED - 
0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 
1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). In addition to those selected spectral 
bands, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalizes Burned Index) were 
tested. The Landsat spectral bands were chosen because of their sensi-
tiveness to fire events. The input of the training data was split into two

The  results  of  the  automatic/visual  comparison  indicate  a  good 
overall  accuracy of  the  algorithm,  which  includes  omission  and  com-
mission errors smaller than 20% by  considering those 40 comparison 
areas as a whole. The highest omission errors have been observed when 
the  burned  areas  have  low  contrast  with  the  unburned  background, 
sometimes related to the burned signal disappearance considering the 
low temporal effective resolution as a consequence of the platform and 
clouds, and some errors identified as omissions that are related to dating 
issues (areas detected, but later than the validation period considered). 
As  for  commission  errors,  the  most  critical  classification  error  was 
observed in croplands. This land cover type includes a variety of crop-
ping types and planting times, where farmers may adopt prescribed fires 
as  an  alternative  of  land  management,  which  makes  difficult  to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. However, typically in machine learning algorithms, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance such as a minimum validation loss or maximum accuracy, or observing no further improvement in the validation set after several epochs. In this case, the algorithm uses a fixed number of interactions (7,000) during the training phase, so one possible criterion could be completing these interactions.
