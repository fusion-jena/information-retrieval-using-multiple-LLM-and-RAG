For the ML model, training and testing datasets were generated
through reference to existing field datasets and VHR images (Section
2.4.3, Table 2). Areas dominated by the target communities were digi-
tised as polygons and all pixels contained were extracted. These poly-
gons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with ~30% of
pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation. Splitting
polygons rather than pixels minimises the effect of spatial autocorrela-
tion on model accuracies (Karasiak et al., 2022). We used a python
implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) to
classify the VTs, given optimised random trees can be developed
whereby each new tree learns from the errors of those previous. As input
to the ML algorithm, the seasonal vegetation index composites from S2,
backscatter composites from S1, elevation and slope were used, totalling
up to 54 features (Appendix-A). The compositing periods were chosen

vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline mentioned does not use any standard image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses custom datasets generated through reference to existing field datasets and Very High Resolution (VHR) images. Specifically, areas dominated by target communities were digitized as polygons, and all pixels contained within them were extracted. These polygons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels for each Vegetation Type (VT) reserved for independent model validation. The input to the machine learning algorithm included seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 (S2), backscatter composites from Sentinel-1 (S1), elevation, and slope, totaling up to 54 features. Additionally, several vector datasets were utilized, including Living Wales data products, peat depth maps, phase-1 habitat survey maps, digital elevation models, saltmarsh layers, mean high water spring tide vectors, and national forest inventory data.
