et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

2.9. Traditional bird data censuses

surveys by affecting the probability that a bird, singing or calling, will be 
audible  and  identifiable  on  a  recording  (Darras  et  al.,  2019;  Rempel 
et  al.,  2013).  The  latest  versions  of  Audiomoth  allows  connecting 
external  microphones,  so  the  detection  range  can  be  potentially 
improved  using  external  microphone  with  lower  SNR,  using  different 
signal  settings,  or  even  using  directional  or  parabolic  microphones 
(Hobson et al., 2002). However, a larger detection range may be at cost 
of  lower  quality  recordings  (at  least  for  those  calls  recorded  at  large 
distances), and therefore result in less accurate estimates of bird distance 
to the recorder (Yip et al., 2020) and difficult the estimate of bird density 
from distance sampling (Buckland et al., 2001).

Passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for monitoring vocally active taxa. Automated signal recognition 
software reduces the expert time needed for recording analyses and allows researchers and managers to manage 
large  acoustic  datasets.  The  application  of  state-of-the-art  techniques  for  automated  identification,  such  as 
Convolutional Neural Networks, may be challenging for ecologists and managers without informatics or engi-
neering expertise. Here, we evaluated the use of AudioMoth — a low-cost and open-source sound recorder — to 
monitor a threatened and patchily distributed species, the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Passive acoustic 
monitoring was carried out across 17 potential wetlands in north Spain. We also assessed the performance of 
BirdNET —  an automated and freely available classifier able to identify over 3000 bird species —  and Kalei-

Helpful Answer:
The method used for collecting raw data in this case is passive acoustic monitoring, which involves deploying audio recorders like AudioMoth to capture sounds produced by birds. This technique is particularly useful for monitoring vocally active taxa, including the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). In this study, passive acoustic monitoring was conducted across 17 potential wetlands in northern Spain. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of BirdNET, an automated and freely available classifier capable of identifying over 3000 bird species. While it does not explicitly mention how BirdNET collects its training data, it could potentially utilize publicly available datasets or recordings collected specifically for this purpose.
