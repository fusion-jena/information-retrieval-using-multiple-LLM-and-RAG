Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

• Selected remote sensing indices, derived from PlanetScope multi-
spectral satellite imagery, allow spatial estimation of volumetric soil
water content in reclaimed areas of hard coal mine with medium
accuracy. This indicates the ability to predict VWC, but also high-
lights room for improvement. Model accuracy could be enhanced by
testing topographical indices at different spatial resolutions. Inte-
gration of microwave data could improve moisture.

of erosion and sediment deposition in watercourses (De Roo, 1998).

to 3.0 m spatial resolution. For the purpose of this study one cloud-free
imagery collected on 2020-08-22 was used.

2.4. Satellite data

2.5. Developing predictive model

PlanetScope is a large constellation of nanosatellites capable of im-
aging the globe daily, offering more opportunities for cloud-free images.
The first groups of PlanetScope satellites were launched in 2015, and the
constellation currently consists of >180 satellites placed in helio-
synchronous orbits. The satellites have digital cameras that offer four
spectral bands: red, green, blue, and infrared, with a spatial resolution of
3.7 m at the nadir, where the nadir is defined as the point on the Earth’s
surface directly below the satellite. For end users, imagery is re-sampled

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in a deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of satellite data, specifically from the PlanetScope constellation of satellites. These satellites provide multispectral imagery with four spectral bands: red, green, blue, and infrared, at a spatial resolution of 3.7 meters at the nadir. The study uses this satellite data to develop a predictive model for estimating Volumetric Water Content (VWC) in reclaimed areas of hard coal mines. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, we can infer that the dataset used in their deep learning pipeline would likely consist of this multispectral satellite imagery.
