2.5. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 

The  HMMs  are  powerful  statistical  models  widely  used  in  various 
fields,  including  speech  recognition,  bioinformatics,  and  natural  lan-
guage processing (Rabiner, 1989; Rabiner and Juang, 1986). At the core 
of  an  HMM  is  the  concept  of  hidden  states,  which  are  not  directly 
observable  but  are  assumed  to  generate  observed  data.  Each  hidden 
state represents a particular underlying system or phenomenon, and the 
transitions between states are governed by probabilities. Additionally, 
each state emits observable symbols or outputs with associated proba-
bilities (Rabiner, 1989; Rabiner and Juang, 1986).

Fig. 7 shows the accuracy performance of the proposed WT-HMM, 
ANN, SVM, and SCD detectors for blue whale vocalization. The HMM 
detector shows an average accuracy performance of around 89.4% over 
10 epochs. This is due to the ability of the proposed feature extraction 
method to effectively capture the patterns in blue whale vocalizations 
from the data. Similarly, the HMM proves to be effective in modeling the 
underlying  hidden  states  that  represent  blue  whale  vocalizations.  For 
the  MLP  neural  network  detector,  each  epoch  involves  feeding  the 
training  data  through  the  network,  calculating  the  prediction, 
comparing it to the actual labels, and adjusting the weights and biases 
using backpropagation optimization techniques. The ANN detector fol-
lows  the  HMM  closely  with  an  average  accuracy  of  88.60%.  The 
consistent  accuracy  across  epochs  indicates  that  the  ANN  is  able  to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is for avian diversity monitoring, specifically for bird species identification. The paper titled "Birdnet: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" discusses this application. However, without more specific information about the architecture or implementation details of the deep learning model mentioned in the context, I cannot provide further insights into its exact purpose beyond identifying bird species.

In general, deep learning models can serve different purposes depending on their design and training objectives. Some common applications include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis or machine translation. These models learn hierarchical representations from input data, allowing them to extract meaningful features and make predictions based on those features.

For instance, in the case of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) discussed in the context, its purpose is to model sequential data with underlying hidden states. It has been applied in various fields like speech recognition, bioinformatics, and natural language processing. In this context, the HMM was used for detecting blue whale vocalizations, achieving an average accuracy of around 89.4% over 10 epochs.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model, we can deduce that it serves the function of identifying bird species for avian diversity monitoring, similar to how the HMM was employed for detecting blue whale vocalizations.
