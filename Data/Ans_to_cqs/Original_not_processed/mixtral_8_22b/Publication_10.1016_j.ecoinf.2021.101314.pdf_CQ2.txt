to three dental variables and two climate variables. In the second run, 
we allowed dental queries to involve disjunctions, and climate queries to 
contain up to three variables, but tightened the requirement of accuracy 
gain.  Specifically,  under  this  constraint,  a  candidate  query  can  be 
extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, 
as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by a least 0.1. The goal 
is to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries. This can be 
achieved either explicitly, by limiting the number of variables and the 
operators  used  in  the  queries,  as  in  the  first  run,  or  implicitly,  by 
allowing increased complexity only if it brings substantial improvement 
in terms of accuracy, as in the second run. 

4.3. Selecting individual redescriptions for further analyses

The  first  run,  with  strict  explicit  constraints,  generated  271  re-
descriptions while the second run, with stringent threshold on accuracy 
gains,  generated  188  redescriptions.  Either  run  took  about 50  min  to 
complete on a commodity laptop. 

We filter the two collections separately, ranking the redescriptions 
by  decreasing  accuracy  and  removing  any  redescription  having  more 
than 90% of its support in common with a higher-ranked one. That is, a 
redescription Rx is removed from the set of results if it contains a more 
accurate redescription Ry such that

calities  that  support  both  queries,  only  the  dental 
trait query and only the climate query, are drawn in 
purple,  in  red  and  in  blue,  respectively.  For  each 
redescription,  we  list  the  query  over  dental  traits 
variables  (qD),  the  query  over  bioclimatic  variables 
(qC), the accuracy of the redescription (J) as well as 
the  size  of  its  support  as  a  percentage  of  the  total 
number of localities (supp %). (For interpretation of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of what specific data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do have some clues regarding the types of data involved in the study.

Firstly, the research involves analyzing dental traits and bioclimatic variables. Dental traits could potentially include images or other visual representations of teeth, which might suggest using image data format. On the other hand, bioclimatic variables would likely consist of numerical data, possibly stored in a structured format like CSV or Excel files.

Secondly, the paper mentions generating redescriptions based on these datasets. Redescriptions refer to finding alternative ways to describe the same dataset, often involving different combinations of features or attributes. This process does not necessarily depend on the original data format; instead, it focuses on extracting meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

Lastly, the authors discuss running their analysis on a commodity laptop, implying that the computational requirements for processing the data are relatively modest. While this doesn't directly indicate the data format, it suggests that the input data may not require extensive preprocessing or specialized hardware to handle large volumes of unstructured data like videos or high-resolution images.

In conclusion, although the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline remain unknown, we can infer that they likely involve a combination of image data for dental traits and structured data (like CSV) for bioclimatic variables.
