using  dropout  regularization.  However,  this  method  might  not  fully 
prevent  overfitting,  and  it  can  sometimes  lead  to  underfitting  if 
overused.

Determining  the  optimal  DNN  architecture  is  an  active  area  of 
research. Recent studies have evaluated different techniques for tuning 
hyperparameters, such as network structure, activation functions, reg-
ularization,  and  optimization  algorithms  (Xu  and  Liang,  2021).  For 
instance,  Lecun  et  al.  (1998)  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  sto-
chastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  for  DNN  training.  Though it  has  been 
shown  to  get  stuck  in  local  minima,  momentum  was  shown  to  help 
overcome  this  by  accelerating  SGD  convergence  (Luo  et  al.,  2021). 
Dropout  regularization  has  also proven  essential  for  controlling  over-
fitting  as  network  depth  and  complexity  increase  (Gupta  and  Raza, 
2020). More recently, exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions 
have  gained  some  traction  for  addressing  ReLU  limitations  like  dead 
neurons  and  slow  convergence  (Alkhouly  et  al.,  2021;  Clevert  et  al.,

adjustable parameters that control network architecture, optimization 
procedure,  and  regularization.  Common  hyperparameters  include 
number of layers and nodes, learning rate, dropout rate, etc. However, 
optimizing  model hyperparameters  remains imperative  for leveraging

This  study  adopted  an  automated  optimization  architecture  by 
comparing three architecture optimization algorithms: Random Search 
(RS), Hyperband, and Bayesian optimization. Hyperparameters of our 
DNN model were automatically optimized according to a search grid of 
several hyperparameters listed in Table 1. A dropout layer was added to 
prevent overfitting and to reduce statistical noise. The dropout regula-
rization  randomly  removed  different  sets  of  neurons  using  a  pre-
determined  dropout  rate,  which  resulted  in  training  different  neural 
networks and reduced overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014).

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions one specific regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - Dropout Regularization. This technique involves adding a dropout layer to the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which randomly removes different sets of neurons during each iteration of training. By doing so, multiple neural networks with varying architectures are trained simultaneously, reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance.

In addition to dropout regularization, other common regularization methods mentioned indirectly in the given context include stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function. While these aren't explicitly referred to as regularization methods, they do contribute to preventing overfitting and enhancing model performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent helps overcome local minima issues, while ELU addresses limitations associated with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), such as dead neurons and slow convergence.

However, it should be noted that the text does not provide explicit information on whether or not L2 regularization was employed in their approach. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot confirm its use alongside dropout regularization.
