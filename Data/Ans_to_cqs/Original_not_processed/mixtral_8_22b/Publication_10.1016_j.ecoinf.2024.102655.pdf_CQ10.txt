River systems provide multiple ecosystem services to society globally, but these are already degraded or
threatened in many areas of the world due to water quality issues linked to diffuse and point-source pollutant
inputs. Water quality evaluation is essential to develop remediation and management strategies. Computational
tools such as machine learning based predictive models have been developed to improve monitoring network
capabilities. The model’s performance is reduced when datasets composed of reductant information are used for
training, on the other hand, the selection of most representative and variable water quality scenarios could result
in higher precision. This study analyzed historical water quality behavior in the Santiago River, Mexico, to
identify the most variable and representative data available to train machine learning models (Adaptive Neuro
Fuzzy Inference System – ANFIS, Artificial Neural Network – ANN, and Support Vector Machine - SVM). Thirteen

2.2. Data pre-processing

The complete dataset of 42 WQPs (Appendix A) for the 13 moni-
toring sites was subjected to an outlier detection and artificial data
replacement process, as Casillas-García et al. (2021) reported. Processed
data were used subsequently to train machine learning models, first with

the full dataset of 13 monitoring sites and secondly with the best training
subset (BTS) composed of sites selected by CA and TSA. Predictions from
all models were evaluated by comparing the root-mean-square-error
(RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and
coefficient of determination (R2) and finally, the BTS-ANFIS was tested
against new data and individual data from each monitoring site. The
general procedure for the training data selection and model develop-
ment is described in Fig. 2.

3.3. Machine learning models

Based on the results of clustering and times series analysis, data from
six sites (RZ01, AA01, RS03, RS04, RS07, and RS09) were included in
