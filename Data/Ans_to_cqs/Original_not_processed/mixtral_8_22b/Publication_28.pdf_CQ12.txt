During  the  classification  process,  the  VAE  model  gets  executed  to 
assign proper class labels to the applied satellite images. Autoencoder 
(AE) is a kind of NN which is trained to replace the input with the output. 
It includes a hidden layer h to define a code employed for input repre-
sentation. The network comprises of an encoder function z = f(x) and 
decoder function r = g(z), where x denotes the input data. The mean-
ingful features from the AE by the constraint that the z to have lower 
dimensions compared to x. The code of the AE which is lesser than the 
input  dimensions  are  known  as  under  complete.  The  learning  of  the 
undercomplete  depiction  enforces  the  AE  in  capturing  the  important 
characteristics of the training data. The VAE is a directed network which 
makes  use  of  learned  approximate  inferences  and  undergoes  training 
using gradient approaches. For generating a sample from the model, the

significant ability for classification by selecting suitable feature to the 
problems  of  remote  sensing  image  classifier  (Cheng  et  al.,  2017). 
Selecting a suitable DL is a sub region of ML which is depending upon 
multiple layers of learning. The DL framework expands from the clas-
sical NN by including additional layers to the hidden layer portion. It has 
several frameworks DL, where CNN is one of them. The CNN is extensive 
and has been utilized recently to handle a different and difficult chal-
lenge like image classification and recognition through a series of feed 
forward layers.

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model for satellite image classification. VAE is a generative model that combines ideas from Bayesian inference and deep learning. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs learn a probabilistic representation of the input data, allowing them to generate new samples similar to the original data. This makes VAEs particularly useful for tasks such as anomaly detection, denoising, and data generation. However, it should be noted that while VAEs can be used for classification tasks, they are not typically considered a primary choice for this purpose. Instead, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often preferred due to their superior performance in handling spatial data such as images. Nevertheless, the authors of the paper chose to use a VAE model for their specific application.
