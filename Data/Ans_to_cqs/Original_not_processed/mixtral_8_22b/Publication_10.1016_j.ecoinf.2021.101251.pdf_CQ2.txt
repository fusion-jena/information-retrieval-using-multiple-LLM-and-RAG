enables advanced search of data across the data packages in ESS-DIVE

the best way for data producers to receive credit but are time consuming 
and  result  in  a  static  view  of  the  data.  Challenging  decisions  such  as 
defining  authorship  and  following  usage  policy  requirements  such  as 
attribution are not directly solved. In cases where usage rules for the 
integrated data are not the same, a method for unifying the data usage 
policies is needed. In our experience, treating all the data as having the 
most restrictive policy can work if the policies are compatible. That is an 
approach  we used  with FLUXNET  which  often  has  two different  data 
usage policies.

important component of the data publication process is specification of 
data usage rights/license by the authors. In this paper, we will refer to a 
published dataset as a data package. A data package contains one or more 
data files and the associated metadata needed to find, interpret, and use 
the data.

Projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics each have many 
different  teams  working  in  the  field  and  producing  large  numbers  of 
high-quality,  multi-disciplinary  data  packages.  Integrating  these 
together as one product can only be achieved if the data usage policies 
are compatible and the data producers can receive appropriate credit for 
their data. For example, when individual network datasets are included 
in the FLUXNET dataset they will be released under a FLUXNET data 
usage policy, the agreed data usage policy is a factor determining which 
regional datasets will be able to be included. When the FLUXNET data 
usage policy is incompatible with the network policy, often data can’t be 
included.  In  cases  where  the  data  are  considered  high-value  the  data 
producers are reluctant to lose the direct credit to their data. In addition, 
new data versions are uploaded regularly due to collection of new data,

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the integration of data from various sources into a single product, specifically referring to projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics. These projects produce high-quality, multidisciplinary data packages containing one or more data files and associated metadata. While the context does not specify the exact format of these data files, it implies that they could potentially include various types of data, such as images, audio, video, or structured data like CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit information on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
