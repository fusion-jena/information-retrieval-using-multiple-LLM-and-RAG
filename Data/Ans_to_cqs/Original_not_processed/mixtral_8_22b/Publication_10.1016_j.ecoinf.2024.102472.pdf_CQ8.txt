During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data. 

2.5.2. Optimal predictor variable selection

XGBoost is a powerful algorithm for estimating carbon stocks, but it 
is not immune to overfitting. By comparing its performance to ANN, we 
can gain deeper insights into its resilience against overfitting and other 
potential forms of model bias. This study provides a readily replicable 
methodology that uses field inventory and remote sensing multispectral 
data and machine learning. According to literature, a limited number of 
studies have tested the utility of the Planetscope eight band high reso-
lution image under reforested urban landscapes. Hence, we examined 
the efficacy of Planetscope data coupled with vegetation indices, texture 
features and terrain variables in retrieving carbon stock estimates over a 
reforested  urban  landscape  in  South  Africa  using  ML  models  i.e., 
XGBoost and ANN.
