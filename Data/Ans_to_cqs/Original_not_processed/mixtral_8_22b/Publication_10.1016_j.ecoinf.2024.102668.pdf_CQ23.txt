bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Our proof-of-principle example demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
comprehensive  processing  pipeline  in  mitigating  device  biases  in  site 
comparisons  using  ecoacoustic  indices  (EAI).  Although  EAIs  are  not 
typically  used  for  site  comparisons  due  to  contradictory  correlations 
with biological variables across different study sites (Bradfer-Lawrence 
et  al.,  2019a),  our  methodology  addresses  one  of  the  previously  un-
considered sources of variability that could explain these contradictions, 
such  as  differences  between  recording  devices.  By  eliminating  device 
bias, we expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine 
learning  and  deep  learning,  which  require  consistent  feature  spaces 
regardless of the recording device used.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it discusses the importance of addressing device bias when comparing ecological acoustical data from various recording devices. The authors propose a comprehensive processing pipeline to reduce this bias, making the data more suitable for broad comparative analyses and applicable to fields such as machine learning and deep learning.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, they conducted inter-brand and intra-brand experiments with two types of recording devices – SongMeters and AudioMoths. These devices had varying sampling frequencies (FS) and gain settings. While the exact number of recordings is not mentioned for each experiment, there were 1988 recordings for the inter-brand experiment and 203 recordings for the intra-brand experiment. This suggests that the researchers aimed to create a diverse dataset by including multiple brands and configurations of recording devices.

Although the text does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, the focus on minimizing device bias can be seen as a step towards improving the robustness and generalizability of any subsequent deep learning models trained on the processed data. By ensuring consistency in feature spaces regardless of the recording device used, the proposed methodology aims to improve the applicability of ecoacoustic indices to emerging fields like machine learning and deep learning.
