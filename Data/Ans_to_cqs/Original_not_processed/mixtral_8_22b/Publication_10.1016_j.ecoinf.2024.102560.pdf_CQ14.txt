Trajectory  (HYSPLIT)  model  to  assess  changes  in  local  vs.  regional 
sources of dust that contribute to an increase in dust loading over the 
lake. This research showed that both anthropogenic and climatic factors 
contributed to various degrees of shrinking of the Urmia Lake.

The ratio γ in Eqs. (3) and (4) is restricted to a small value as Eq. (2) 
to ensure the empirical scaling function and the empirical wavelets are a 
tight frame of ωn: τn = γ ωn, 0 < γ < 1. The function β(x) is a polynomial 
function described as:
