Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to perform classification tasks, and its parameters were learned from training data to improve classification performance. In general, common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision evaluates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall calculates the proportion of true positives among actual positives. Lastly, the F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced view of the model's performance. Without explicit information about the evaluation metrics used in this study, we cannot definitively determine which ones were employed.
