harness this challenging environment. More specifically, robotic vehi-
cles, autonomous vehicles, and surface vessels have been deployed for 
the  offshore  industries  and  deep-sea  archaeology,  ocean  engineering 
projects, rescue operations and environmental measurements for the last 
several  decades.  For  instance,  the  Argo  program,  an  international 
collaboration,  has  deployed  approximately  3900  instruments  in  the 
world's oceans to facilitate the collection of data for climatological and 
oceanographic studies. (Riser et al., 2016). Besides, artificial structures

There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given references. None of the cited papers include a direct link to their respective code repositories. However, it would be best practice to check each paper's corresponding authors' personal websites, institutional webpages, or search popular code hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket with relevant keywords related to the research topic. This may help locate any publicly accessible code repositories associated with these studies.
