where  zi  is  the  output  value  of  the  i-th  neuron,  wj  is  the  convolution 
weight for input value xj, bi  is the bias, and f is the activation function. 
The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

The Convolutional Layer performs the convolution operation, aiding 
in extracting local spatial patterns and features from the input data. Each 
neuron in the convolutional layer is associated with a small region of 
input data called a receptive field. The convolution operation involves 
applying a  convolution kernel to  the receptive field  and computing a 
weighted sum of values. Formally, for each neuron in the convolutional 
layer, the output value can be calculated as follows (Gholamalinezhad 
and Khosravi, 2020):

The Fully Connected Layer represents a classic multi-layer percep-
tron  and  performs  matrix  multiplication  between  input  data  and 
weights. It enables the model to capture more complex nonlinear de-
pendencies  and  generalize  information  from  previous  layers.  Each 
neuron in the fully connected layer receives input data from all neurons 
in the previous layer and applies an activation function to obtain the 
output value. 

The Output Layer is the final layer of the neural network, generating 
LULC  classification  predictions.  Typically,  an  activation  function  like 
Softmax is used to obtain probability estimates for each LULC class. 

The LULC Map is the ultimate result of classification, representing a 
spatial  map  of  land  use  and  land  cover.  Each  pixel  in  the  LULC  map 
depicts the class to which it belongs, based on the model's predictions.

The  main  idea  behind  convolutional  neural  networks involves  the 
utilization  of  convolutions  and  pooling  to  process  input  images  (Al- 
Saffar et al., 2017). Each layer consists of a set of filters (kernels) that 
slide over the image, performing convolution operations. 

Mathematically,  convolution  is  defined  as  follows  (Wiatowski  and 
B¨olcskei,  2017):  let's  consider  an  input  image  X  with  dimensions  of 
WxHxD, where W and H are the width and height of the image, and D is 
the number of channels (e.g., 3 for the Landsat-8 stack of visible color 
range). Let's have a filter with dimensions of F x F x D, where F is the 
filter  size.  Convolution  of  the  filter  with  the  image  is  performed  by 
moving the filter over the image with a step size S and calculating the 
element-wise product and summation: 

Convolution(X, filter) =

∑( ∑( ∑

(X(i, j, k)*filter(i, j, k) )

Helpful Answer:
In the context of deep learning pipelines, including those used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), various optimization techniques are employed to minimize the loss function during training. Two commonly used optimization algorithms are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

SGD is an iterative method for optimizing differentiable objective functions, often used in machine learning applications. In this algorithm, the gradient of the cost function is computed for only one or a few samples at a time, rather than the entire dataset. This makes SGD computationally efficient when dealing with large datasets. However, due to its stochastic nature, SGD may exhibit high variance and slower convergence compared to other methods.

On the other hand, Adam is another popular optimization technique that combines the advantages of two other methods: Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and momentum-based optimization. Adam maintains individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter, allowing for faster convergence and better performance on noisy gradients. By combining these properties, Adam offers improved stability and efficiency compared to traditional SGD.

Other optimization techniques used in deep learning include RMSProp, AdaGrad, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). These methods differ in their approaches to updating weights and handling noise in the gradients, offering trade-offs between computational complexity, memory requirements, and overall performance. Ultimately, the choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as the specific application, available resources, and desired outcomes.
