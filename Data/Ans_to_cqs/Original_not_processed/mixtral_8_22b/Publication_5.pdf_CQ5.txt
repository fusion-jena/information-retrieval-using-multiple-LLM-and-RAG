The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiﬁc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Regarding the DL framework, our proposed models were based on the most typical
type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used
in this study. As mentioned in Section 2.4, general image-based CNN architectures may
not be appropriate for our data; applying one-dimensional CNN [81,82] or recurrent neural
networks [83] in the temporal domain, or graph convolutional networks for handling graph
structures between samples [84] should be interesting topics, as these are more advanced
approaches. Additionally, super-resolution using a generative adversarial network [85]
would further improve the spatial resolution of species richness map.

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide specific information about the dataset(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input data consists of pixels, suggesting that the dataset might contain images or raster data. It also states that general image-based CNN architectures may not be suitable for their data, implying that the dataset could have unique characteristics that require customization of the deep learning approach. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the dataset(s), it is impossible to identify them accurately.
