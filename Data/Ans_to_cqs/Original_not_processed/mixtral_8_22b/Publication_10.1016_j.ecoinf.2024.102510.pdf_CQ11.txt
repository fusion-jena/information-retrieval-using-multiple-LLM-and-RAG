selected CNN models on all datasets could not be assessed due to the lack 
of specific datasets used in prior studies. Various studies have employed 
different datasets and methods to recognize bird species. Table 1 shows 
that  these  studies  reported  accuracy  rates  ranging  from  82.10%  to

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention or reference to a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would require additional resources or references to accurately determine this information.
