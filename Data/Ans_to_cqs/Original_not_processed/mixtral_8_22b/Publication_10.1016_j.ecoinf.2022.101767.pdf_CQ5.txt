Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

from online shared videos that contain a wide range of species richness 
(from 1 to 106 wild bird species in the videos used in this study).

2.2. Data extraction of videos displaying wild birds

For thumbnail information, we classified the thumbnail character-
istics into six categories, including people, birds, objects, scenery, text, 
and food. Objects that we identified in the videos were either a camera 
or  binoculars.  Each  thumbnail  category  was  recorded  as  a  separate 
column (i.e., basically, with a value of 0 or 1 in a separate column of 
each category). 

2.3. Data analysis 

The  following  data  analyses  were  performed  using  R  software 
version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021) with Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, 
and randomForest packages.

number  of  subscribers  in  the  channel,  thumbnail  information,  bird 
species  that  appeared,  and  name(s)  of  target  place(s).  Because  the 
number of views increases with time, we recorded the number of views 
for the videos as of 16 July 2022.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific dataset was used for the deep learning pipeline. However, from the context, we can infer that the dataset used might be related to wild bird species since the research involves analyzing videos containing various wild bird species. The dataset likely includes features such as the number of subscribers in the channel, thumbnail information, bird species that appear, and names of target places. Additionally, the researchers used R software version 4.1.2 with several packages like Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest for their data analysis. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the dataset used, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which specific dataset was utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
