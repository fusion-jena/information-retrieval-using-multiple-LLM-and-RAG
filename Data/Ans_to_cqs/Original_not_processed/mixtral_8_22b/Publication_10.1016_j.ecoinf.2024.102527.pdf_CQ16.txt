Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

When the SS dataset served as target domain datasets, we still uti-
lized the validation and test sets from Table 2, referring to them as S_V 
and S_T, respectively. Regarding the training sets, we randomly selected 
capture  events  from  S_2_100  and  created  five  different  training  sets 
containing 2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 samples, respectively. 
These  training  sets  were  labeled  as  S_2,  S_5,  S_8,  S_10,  and  S_20  (see 
Table S.3 in the Supporting Information for the details), respectively.

respectively.  N  represented  the  number  of  images  in  the  test  set  or 
validation set. 

2.2.6. Model training and hyper-parameters 

We  trained  models  on  the  training  sets  and  tracked  the  model 
training process on the validation set. The training process was stopped 
when  the  loss  value  of  the  model  on  the  validation  set  no  longer 
decreased. We then tested the model performance on the test set. Our 
computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two 
Tesla  K80  GPUs  and  256  GB  of  memory.  For  the  deep  learning  envi-
ronment,  we  utilized  the  PyTorch  1.7.1  platform.  We  employed  the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of 
μ  = 0.9 to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model 
training were shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information.

2.2.4. Experiment design  

(1)  Transfer learning strategy optimization

Fig. 8. The accuracies of transfer learning models on the test set and the corresponding binomial test probability value when models were transferred from the 
S_10_10 dataset to the LSM dataset. (a) Accuracies of models under different transfer strategies. The abscissa represented the training set sample size (in thousands of 
images). (b) The binomial test probability values between the best-performing transfer strategy and other transfer strategies. The TFS meant that the model was 
trained from scratch. The TLS_i (i = 1, 2, …, 5) represented that different layers of the ResNext-101 model were selected for updating. A probability value <0.05 
indicated a significant difference.

Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on the loss value of the model on the validation set. Specifically, the training process is stopped when the loss value of the model on the validation set no longer decreases. This indicates that further training would not improve the model's performance on unseen data.
