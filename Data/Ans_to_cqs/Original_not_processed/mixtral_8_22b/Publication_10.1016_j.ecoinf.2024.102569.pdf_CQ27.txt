The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, 
removing  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations.  The  RTMSPE  is 
defined as follows:

To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2) 
=
and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods.
