The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, some general principles can still be discussed based on common practices in the field.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like initial weight initialization, shuffling training examples, or using dropout regularization techniques. To manage these sources of randomness, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility across different runs of the same model. This allows researchers to compare results more accurately and maintain consistency when sharing code or models.

2. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques helps mitigate the impact of randomness caused by splitting datasets into training and testing sets. By repeating the process multiple times with different splits, we can obtain a more robust estimate of our model's performance.

3. Ensemble Models: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can help reduce variance and improve overall performance. This approach leverages the diversity introduced by randomness to create stronger ensemble models.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters through grid search or other optimization techniques can indirectly affect how randomness impacts the final model. For example, adjusting the learning rate or batch size might influence the degree to which randomness affects convergence during training.

In summary, managing randomness in deep learning pipelines involves setting fixed random seeds, employing cross-validation techniques, utilizing ensemble models, and optimizing hyperparameters. These strategies aim to minimize the negative effects of randomness while maximizing the benefits of stochastic processes inherent in deep learning algorithms.
