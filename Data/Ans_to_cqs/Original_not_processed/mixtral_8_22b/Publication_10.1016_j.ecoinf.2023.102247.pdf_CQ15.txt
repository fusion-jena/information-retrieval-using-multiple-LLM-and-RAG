To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Pachauri 
et al., 2014) provided multiple Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs)  for  predicting  climate  change  under  different  greenhouse  gas 
emission trajectories. We constructed habitat suitability models of the 
three species under the RCP2.6 (low emission) and RCP8.5 (high emis-
sion)  scenarios  using  the  same  modeling  method  and  with  the  same 
habitat variables described above. The predicted current niche models 
were projected into future climate conditions to identify range shifts in

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized ensemble modeling in their research. They employed the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. This approach involves combining multiple models to create a single prediction model. In this case, they used four different models: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were then weighted and averaged to produce a final ensembled model for each species.

To evaluate the performance of these models, the authors used cross-validation by dividing the dataset into 70% training data and 30% testing data. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was used as the metric to measure the accuracy of the models. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.

However, based on the provided information, there is no mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding which optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
