%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. None of the provided references mention any specific cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
