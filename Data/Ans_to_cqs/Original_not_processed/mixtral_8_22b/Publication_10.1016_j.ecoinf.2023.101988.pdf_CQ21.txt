2.2. Field plan 

Four sessions of fieldwork were undertaken over a 12-month period 
to  cover  the  four  commonly  associated  seasonal  types  (Table  1.).  To 
reduce  the  risk  of  disturbance,  line-transect  surveys  using  the  drone 
were undertaken the day prior or the day after observer line-transect 
surveying. To further minimise the impact of human activity, particu-
larly when using the drone, a ten-day interval was observed between 
visits. Visits alternated between mornings on one session (between 6 am 
and 9 am) and afternoons on the second (between 4 pm and 7 pm).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualizations help identify which parts of the input data had the most significant influence on the output prediction. They provide insights into how the model is making its decisions and can aid in debugging any issues with the model.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. These metrics help compare different models and select the best performing ones.

3. Confusion Matrix: This table summarizes the predictions made by the model against actual values. It provides information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. By analyzing this matrix, we can understand where our model performs well and where it struggles.

4. Model Interpretability: Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and others can be used to explain individual predictions made by complex machine learning models.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: After evaluating the initial results, hyperparameters may need adjustment to improve the model's performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and other methods can be employed for tuning these parameters.

These postprocessing steps ensure that the final model meets desired performance criteria and helps build trust in the model's decision-making capabilities.
