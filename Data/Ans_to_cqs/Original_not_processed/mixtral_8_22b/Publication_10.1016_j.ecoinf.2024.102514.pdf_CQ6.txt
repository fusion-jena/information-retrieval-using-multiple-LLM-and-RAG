Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

2.4. WQI prediction approach 

Numerous studies have utilized ML/AI to predict the quality of water 
in different waterbodies (El et al., 2021; Najah Ahmed et al., 2019). The 
methodological procedure utilized in this study is presented in Fig. 2. 
The process of WQI prediction using ML/ AI is described as follows: 

2.4.1. Data standardization 

Data standardization is a fundamental procedure before training ML 
(Uddin et al., 2022a). This process optimises the model error by con-
verting  all  variables  to  a  uniform  scale  (Rahman,  2019).  The  present 
study adopted Z score normalization techniques to standardize the WQ 
indicator data. The Z score formula (Eq. (2)) can be expressed as follows: 

Z =

Xi (cid:0) X
σ

(2)  

where, Z is the standardize score, Xi  is the ith  variable of WQ indicator 
dataset, X refers to the mean value of WQ indicator data and σ  is the 
standard deviation WQ indicator data, respectively. 

2.4.2. Data splitting

2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. These steps include:

1. Normalization: This involves converting all variables to a uniform scale, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others and improves convergence speed during optimization. One common method used for normalization is the Z-score normalization technique, where each value is subtracted by the mean and then divided by the standard deviation.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling also aims to bring features to a comparable range. However, instead of transforming values based on their distribution, scaling simply multiplies or divides them by a constant factor. Common methods for scaling include min-max scaling and unit length scaling.

3. Cleaning: Before feeding data into a deep learning model, it is essential to clean the dataset by removing missing values, outliers, and irrelevant information. Missing values can be replaced with statistical measures like mean, median, or mode, while outliers can be detected using statistical tests or visualizations. Irrelevant information should be removed since they do not contribute to improving the model's performance.

These preprocessing steps help improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning model by reducing noise, increasing stability, and enhancing generalizability.
