number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

The low classification accuracy of the neural network caused by the 
lack of birdsong spectrogram data can be solved by data augmentation 
of ACGAN. In addition, we can improve the feature extraction capability 
of the network by increasing its depth. However, increasing the network 
depth  may  lead  to  overfitting  and  require  significant  computational 
resources.  Some  researchers  have  proposed  dynamic  convolution  to 
solve  those  problems,  using  a  set  of  K  parallel  convolution  kernels 
instead  of  a  single  convolution  kernel  per  layer.  These  parallel  con-
volutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention. The atten-
tion  dynamically  adjusts  the  weight  of  each  convolution  kernel 
according to the input, thus generating an adaptive dynamic convolu-
tion. Experiments results show that this structure achieved a 2.9% gain 
in the Imagenet classification task and an AP gain of 2.9 in CoCo Key-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query based solely on the provided information.

However, generally speaking, deep learning models often require substantial computing power and memory capacity to train efficiently. As such, they are commonly trained on specialized hardware devices such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These devices offer high levels of parallel processing capabilities, which enable them to perform complex mathematical operations required for training deep learning models more quickly and efficiently compared to traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs).

Therefore, while I cannot confirm the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model discussed in the given context, it is reasonable to assume that some form of specialized hardware device was likely utilized to facilitate efficient training.
