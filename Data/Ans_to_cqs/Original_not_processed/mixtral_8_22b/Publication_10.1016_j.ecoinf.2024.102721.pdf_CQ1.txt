Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes various sources for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For instance, remote sensing images were used to extract vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). These images were obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform, which provides access to satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Additionally, meteorological data was collected using automatic weather stations installed within the study area. This data included variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Furthermore, groundwater level data was gathered through manual measurements taken from wells located within the study area. Lastly, socioeconomic data related to population size, agricultural production, and industrial output was sourced from government databases and statistical reports. Overall, the study employs a diverse range of data collection methods to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant factors influencing ecological water demand in an arid oasis environment.
