Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.8. Practical deployment 

Our  proposed  hierarchical  classification  model  exhibits  relatively 
less  computational  load  than  deep  learning  models,  showcasing  the 
potential of our new medicinal plant species classification framework. 
Further, it reduces the burden of manual efforts in accurately classifying 
a  plant  species  and  its  medicinal  benefits.  To  validate  the  practical 
deployment as a smartphone-based application, we assess the efficiency 
of  the  proposed  baseline  hierarchical  classification  model  using  two 
real-time datasets. Two experts validate the machine predictions of the 
proposed model. Conformity exists for more than 50% of samples be-
tween expert and machine predictions. Thus, only 75.46% of the sam-
ples from RTL80 and RTP40 are accurately predicted with the baseline 
hierarchical classification model. 

5.9. Intra-class variations and inter-class similarities of plant species

2.2. Classification using deep learning models 

Plant  leaf  recognition  has  been  carried  out  using  deep  learning 
models for adaptability to handle many species or classes. Some of the 
investigations in these directions are as discussed.

samples in GSL100 would also help in the extensibility of the developing 
a deep learning model that works on multiple levels.

leaf-based  plant  species  classification.  However,  medicinal  plants  are 
not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-
sionality reduction with ESPCA is adapted to classify thirty-two plant 
species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic 
gradient descent technique. Later, (Ganguly et al., 2022), utilized the 
ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion 
learning  and  is  trained  on  three  benchmark  datasets  to  showcase  the 
effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly 
focus  on  the  classification  of  a  large  group  of  Indian  medicinal  plant

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Instead, it focuses on validating the practical deployment of a proposed hierarchical classification model as a smartphone-based application. This validation involves assessing the efficiency of the proposed model using two real-time datasets and comparing the machine predictions with those made by human experts. More than 50% conformity between expert and machine predictions was found, and 75.46% of the samples were accurately predicted using the baseline hierarchical classification model. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
