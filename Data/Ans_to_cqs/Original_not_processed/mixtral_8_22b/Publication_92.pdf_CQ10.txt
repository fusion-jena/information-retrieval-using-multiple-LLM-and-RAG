Deep Learning. The architecture of our network follows the GoogLeNet’s
with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classiﬁer. Once we have a list
of cropped thumbnails and their labels, we send them to our network. We use
inception layers (Fig. 4) based on GoogLeNet architecture [22]. The inceptions
here allows us to reduce the dimension of the picture to one pixel, and therefore
not to be dependent of the dimensional impact. We adapted some parameters
such as the size of the strides and the ﬁrst convolutions adapted to the size of our
thumbnails, which allowed us to achieve better results than a classic architecture
(e.g. [18]).

3.3 Post-processing and Bounding Box Fusion

For each sliding window, we deﬁne a motion score by computing the average
absolute diﬀerence with the window at the same position in the previous frame.
Based on the hypothesis that most of the ﬁshes are moving, we use this score
for the ﬁnal detection decision.

Finally, in order to improve the localization accuracy, we decided to create
another class called part of ﬁsh, to ensure that the network does not focus on
a distinctive part of a ﬁsh as a stripe, a ﬁn, the head, but processes the ﬁsh
as a whole. We also created a class ﬁsh which contains some unknown ﬁshes to
make the method able to recognize any ﬁsh even though it is not in the learning
database. However, this class must contain less samples in order to be sure that
a ﬁsh will most likely be labeled by its speciﬁc class rather than the generic class
ﬁsh. Finally, we added 3 classes to our initial thumbnail database as listed in
Table 2.

with his as the databases are diﬀerent (we have a higher deﬁnition and mobile
cameras).

In this paper, we propose also to explore the performances of ﬁsh detection
and classiﬁcation by Deep Learning. In particular, we assess the results with
respect to a more classical method based on a combination of HOG feature
extraction and SVM classiﬁcation. For this, we will use High Deﬁnition videos
acquired for an actual marine ecology study. In Sect. 2, we brieﬂy present Deep-
learning and SVM+HOG methods. In Sect. 3, we detail the implementation in
particular the multi-resolution approach and data preprocessing. In Sect. 4 we
present the results and compare both methods. In Sect. 5, we present some future
work.
