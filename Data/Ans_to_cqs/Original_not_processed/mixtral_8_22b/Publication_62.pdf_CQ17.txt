Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors use two main regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines: Dropout and Batch Normalization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. In both the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, a DropoutLayer with a probability of 0.5 is applied after the FlattenLayer. This means that half of the neurons in this layer will be dropped out during each iteration of training.

Batch Normalization is another regularization method that normalizes the activations of each batch of inputs, reducing internal covariate shift and improving the speed and stability of the network. It is applied after every ConvolutionLayer in both models.

There is no mention of using L2 regularization or other forms of weight decay in these models. However, the use of Dropout and Batch Normalization should be sufficient to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
