structure of EPDNet, which works with the face box's width and height 
as  input  and  the  eye-phone  distance  as  output.  The  ReLU  activation 
function  and  sigmoid  are  used  to  cope  with  non-linearity.  The  five 
neuron  layers  following  the  concatenation  are  all  fully  connected.  In 
EPDNet training, we employ the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss func-
tion and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. We use the 
R2  metric to assess the model's fit to the observed data. After training, 
this model fits well with the R2  of 0.95.

5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

SegFormer offers a set of MiT encoders (marked by MiT-B0, up to 
MiT-B5) with increasing model sizes. To strike a balance between per-
formance  and  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  model  deployment  on 
resource-constrained  mobile  devices,  we  choose  the  MiT-B1  as  the 
encoder of GVI learning. We train the model on a server with an NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The weights pretrained on 
ImageNet-1 K dataset are used to initialize the encoder and decoder. In 
training, we use the AdamW optimizer with the momentum parameter 
(cid:0) 8  to prevent division by zero.

We employ a cosine annealing schedule and set the initial learning rate 
to 0.0001. The model is trained on the UGE-D dataset for 100 epochs 
with the batch size of eight. We supervise SegFormer's training with the 
Cross-Entropy loss function, which is formulated as:

The  MiT  encoder  of  SegFormer  is  designed  as  a  hierarchically 
transformer structure, which can generates the high-resolution coarse 
features  and  the  low-resolution  fine-grained  features.  The  MiT  trans-
former  blocks  use  the  sequence  reduction  process  in  self-attention 
layers,  which  can  reduce  the  computational  burden  by  a  constant 
ratio.  In  addition,  each  transformer  block  directly  places  a  Mix-FNN 
component  (zoomed in  at  the  right bottom  part of  Fig. 12),  along its 
feed-forward path and right before its output. With the Mix-FNN policy, 
SegFormer  does  not  need  to  train  positional  encoding  and  then,  can 
work with better generalization ability. The ALL-MLP decoder of Seg-
former consists entirely of MLP components, which are arranged in four 
main steps. With introducing few additional parameters, the ALL-MLP 
decoder  is  simple  but  effective,  because  its  input  (i.e.,  the  MiT  en-

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, two optimization techniques are mentioned for different deep learning pipelines. For the EPDNet, the Adam optimizer is employed during training with a learning rate of 0.0001. This choice of optimizer suggests that the authors wanted to leverage the benefits of adaptive learning rates offered by Adam, which adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradients.

For the SegFormer model used in measuring photo GVI, the AdamW optimizer is utilized with the momentum parameter set to (0.9, 0.999) and epsilon set to 10^-7. AdamW is a variant of Adam that includes weight decay, which helps regularize the model and improve generalization performance. By using this optimizer, the authors aim to take advantage of both adaptive learning rates and weight decay to achieve optimal results.

Additionally, a cosine annealing schedule is employed for the SegFormer model, which gradually decreases the learning rate over time according to a cosine curve. This technique allows the model to explore more widely early in training and focus on fine-tuning later, potentially improving convergence and final accuracy.
