The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the

All  experiments  were  performed  on  a  personal  computer  with  a 
1060Ti GPU and an Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. Additionally, CUDA 
v10.1 was applied to train the model, which accelerated the processing 
speed; Python version 3.7 was also used. The other libraries used were 
NumPy  (v1.21.2),  PyTorch  (v1.6.0),  Pycocotools,  Cython,  Matplotlib, 
tqdm, yacs, and OpenCV. 

The wild  animals  were tracked  using the  Siamese  network,  which 
updated the connection weights of each network layer by learning the 
features of the training samples. This ensured that the tracking method 
produced  accurate  results(Kang  et  al.,  2019).  In  comparison  with 
traditional training methods, the few-shot learning method can rapidly

train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).
