trogram. In addition to different TFRs, a different deep learning architecture, SubSpectralNet, is employed
to classify bird sounds. Experimental results on classifying 43 bird species show that fusing selected deep
learning models can effectively increase the classiﬁcation performance. Our best fused model can achieve a
balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%.

The duration of audio ﬁles in CLO-43DS data is different,
which cannot be directly used as the input to the CNN. The
ﬁrst method for dealing with the multi-variate varying length
audio data is that the signal is repeated from the beginning to
force the ﬁxed duration of 2s, which has been used in [30].
The second method is to directly resize the audio image to a
ﬁxed size.

D. DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE
The feature learning part of our proposed model follows a
VGG style network [24], which has been previously used
for classifying acoustic scenes [5]. The overall architec-
ture is illustrated in Table 1. This network is trained using
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10−4. The cate-
gorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The
batch size is 64 samples and the network is trained with
200 epochs.

the input to those CNNs are Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component

To further improve the classiﬁcation performance, we not
only fuse CNN-based models with different input features,
but also fuse another CNN-based model with a different
architecture (see Table 2). The best classiﬁcation F1-score
can be up to 93.31%. Different from the VGG style network,
the SubSpectralNet can be regarded as a ﬁlter with different

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors propose a system for improving bird sound classification by employing various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models. They use three types of Time-Frequency Representations (TFRs): Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. These representations serve as inputs to their respective CNN architectures, namely Mel-CNN, Harm-CNN, and Perc-CNN. Additionally, they utilize a different deep learning architecture called SubSpectralNet, which is also a CNN-based model.

The feature learning component of their proposed model adheres to a VGG-style network, which was previously applied for classifying acoustic scenes. This network employs Adam optimization with a learning rate of 10^-4, categorical cross-entropy as its loss function, a batch size of 64 samples, and trains for 200 epochs.

To enhance the classification performance, the researchers combine multiple CNN-based models with distinct input features and architectures. Their best fusion model achieves a balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary deep learning models used in this pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically the VGG-style network and SubSpectralNet.
