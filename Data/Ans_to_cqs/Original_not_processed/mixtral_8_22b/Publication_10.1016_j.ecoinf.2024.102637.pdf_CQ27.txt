generalised  model  by  adding  convolution  modules  or  introducing  re-
sidual  connection  techniques.  However,  more  complex  and  deeper 
models  often  incur  higher  computational  costs  and  require  longer 
training  time.  To  solve  these  problems,  the  AlexNet  network  was 
designed to be lightweight and optimised to achieve deep training and 
short-term testing (Zhang et al., 2022). Specifically, the two convolution 
layers are merged in the model deployment mode while ensuring that 
the nonlinear factors caused by the activation function are not reduced. 
By reducing the number of layers in the model, the computational effi-
ciency is improved (Ding et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2017) and the infer-
ence time of the model is significantly shortened.

In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

1. Introduction 

Combining  bird  voice  recognition  and  deep  learning  is  vital  for 
monitoring bird species for conservation. It is an essential indicator for 
monitoring  the  ecosystem  health  and  conducting  practical  ecological 
assessments  for  biodiversity  conservation  (Liu  et  al.,  2023).  Through 
population monitoring, scholars can understand the responses of local 
birds  to  environmental  changes  and  conservation  efforts.  Monitoring 
bird movement in real-time is also the first step in monitoring the bal-
ance of the ecosystem (Xie et al., 2022). Many professionals have begun 
to  conduct  long-term  observations  of  birds  to  protect  their  species. 
Therefore, training the collected data using appropriate network models 
and constructing an automatic bird recognition system are of profound 
significance.

complexity. This helps solve the problems of model training time and 
computing  resources.  Shazzadul  Islam  et  al.  (Islam  et  al.,  2019)  used 
VGG-16  to  extract  features  from  bird  images  and  then  used  support 
vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The 
ResNet network (He et al., 2016) optimises the network through residual 
modules by introducing skip connections between the traditional con-
volutional layers. This enables the network to learn and retain low-level 
feature  information  better,  thereby  avoiding  gradient  vanishing  and 
representation bottlenecks. Sankupellay et al. (Sankupellay and Kono-
valov,  2018)  used  ResNet-50  to  automatically  recognise  the  spectro-
grams of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%–72%.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including aspects like model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that the model was designed to be lightweight and optimized for deep training and short-term testing. Additionally, it discusses merging two convolution layers during model deployment while maintaining nonlinear factors introduced by the activation function. These points suggest that the focus was on creating an efficient and streamlined model suitable for deployment. Nevertheless, without further information, it isn't possible to describe the exact steps taken for model deployment.
