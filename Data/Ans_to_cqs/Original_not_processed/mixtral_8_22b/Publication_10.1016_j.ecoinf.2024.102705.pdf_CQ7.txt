The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

3.1. Implementation details 

The training protocol outlined by (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) was 
followed during the training process. The YOLOv3 model served as the 
baseline for all experiments. To expand the training dataset, various data 
augmentation  techniques  were  employed,  including  random  adjust-
ments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. The AIP- 
OD  model  was  trained  using  the  Adam  optimizer  (Kingma  and  Ba, 
2014). The training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 
(cid:0) 4and gradually decreased to 
4. The learning rate initially started at 10
over  the  course  of  training.  The  experiments  were  conducted  using 
Tensorflow 1.14 and executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU. 

3.2. Evaluating indicator 

The evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) 
as a mainstream performance metric. AP represents the area under the 
precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different 
thresholds.

our method exhibits improved accuracy by 1.35% and 0.08% in com-
parison to IA-YOLO on both datasets, respectively. This serves as evi-
dence  that the  non-local layers  incorporated into  the  CNN  effectively 
extract  long-distance  features  that  facilitate  parameter  prediction.  In 
additional  baseline  experiments,  the  model  with  added  AIP  module 
improved  by  1.47%  and  2.27%  compared  to  the  YOLOv8s  baseline 
model on both datasets, respectively. This proves that our proposed AIP 
module can be flexibly applied to different baseline models and improve 
its performance in low-quality images.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, typically, the data is divided into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. The validation set is often used to tune hyperparameters or select the best model architecture. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling or stratified sampling based on class labels. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain similar distributions of classes to avoid bias in the model's predictions.
