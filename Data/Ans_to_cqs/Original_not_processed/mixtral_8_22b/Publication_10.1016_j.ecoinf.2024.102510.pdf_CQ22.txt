3.2. Performance metrics 

Performance metrics are essential tools in evaluating the effective-
ness of machine learning models. They provide quantitative measures to 
assess the performance of the model on a given task. Validation Accu-
racy,  Precision,  Recall,  and  F1-Score  are  used  to  evaluate  the  perfor-
mance of classification models. 

Validation accuracy is a commonly used performance metric in deep 
learning, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances 
in the validation dataset. It is calculated as: 

Precision is another important metric that quantifies the proportion 
of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as 
positive. It can be calculated using Eq. (2): 

Precision =

TP
TP + FP

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the 
proportion  of  correctly  predicted  positive  instances  out  of  all  actual 
positive instances. It is calculated as: 

Recall =

TP
TP + FN

models to achieve the maximum possible accuracy through multiple iterations. Experimental analysis revealed 
that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In 
contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%, while other

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of deep learning models is typically evaluated using several key metrics such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validation accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset. Precision quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. The F1-score provides a single measure that combines both precision and recall into a single value, representing their harmonic mean. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying instances and identifying relevant patterns within the data.
