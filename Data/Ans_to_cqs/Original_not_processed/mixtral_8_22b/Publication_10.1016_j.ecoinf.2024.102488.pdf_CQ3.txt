Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) being used for classification tasks related to wetland mapping. These algorithms do not directly involve data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically associated with computer vision tasks involving object detection and semantic segmentation. Instead, these algorithms rely on labeled datasets where each sample is assigned a class label. In summary, while the context discusses various machine learning models applied to remote sensing data, it does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
