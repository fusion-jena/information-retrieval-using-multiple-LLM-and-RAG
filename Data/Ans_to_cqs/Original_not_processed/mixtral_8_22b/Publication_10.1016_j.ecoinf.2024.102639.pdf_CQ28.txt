In animal behavior studies, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) 
and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  methodologies  represents  a  significant  para-
digm  shift.  Traditionally,  these  advanced  computational  techniques, 
renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields such as artificial intel-
ligence  (Marar,  2024),  image  processing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015),  neuro-
science (Dixon and Polson, 2020), and genomics (Xiao and Segal, 2009), 
have not been extensively harnessed for modeling or predicting animal 
movement. Such approaches extend the application of these technolo-
gies beyond their conventional domains and aim to transcend the mere 
prediction  of  behavior.  The  objective  is  to  craft  a  methodology  that 
utilizes machine learning to forecast behavioral patterns and intricately 
map animals’ actual movement trajectories.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was utilized based on the given context.
