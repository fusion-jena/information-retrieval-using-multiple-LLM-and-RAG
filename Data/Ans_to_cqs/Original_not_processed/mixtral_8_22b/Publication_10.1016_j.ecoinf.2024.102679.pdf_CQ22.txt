with a 50% probability of occurrence. To avoid any risk of overfitting at 
each  training  stage,  we  selected  the  model  relative  to  the  epoch  that 
gave the best performance on the validation set. During inference, the 
patch  size  was  set  to  1024  × 1,024  pixels  to  accelerate  the  process. 
Further information on the fine-tuning process is described in section

2.5. Image processing 

Images have been processed through the use of the DL model coupled 
with  human  manual  interpretation  steps.  This  ‘human-assisted’  DL- 
based  image  processing  pipeline  has  been  designed  to  minimize 
human effort while maximizing the quality of counting results. In the 
following sections, this approach is referred to as the Semi-Automated 
Deep Learning (SADL) model, and SADL-OCC refers to the integration 
of  the  SADL  model  with  the  OCC  technique.  This  section  therefore 
presents the main components and steps of this developed approach.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions selecting the model based on its performance on the validation set during each training stage. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances; precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all predicted positives; recall shows the fraction of relevant instances retrieved from the data; and the F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Given these common practices, it can be assumed that similar metrics were likely employed to assess the model's performance.
