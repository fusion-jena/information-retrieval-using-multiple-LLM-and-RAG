%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine which metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others were used to assess the model's performance.
