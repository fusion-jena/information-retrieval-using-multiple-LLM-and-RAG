we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

exploring the parameter space using randomized grid search methods

tween model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. 
This studyâ€™s main research objectives are as follows: to demonstrate

randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore (Bergstra 
and  Bengio,  2012).  Instead  of  exhaustively  searching  through  all 
possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-
ally  expensive  and  time-consuming,  randomized  grid  search  offers 
several  advantages, like,  reduces computational cost, especially when 
dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and it has been shown 
to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, 
particularly  when  some  hyperparameters  are  more  influential  than 
others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). We then generated 
various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a 
uniform distribution and evaluated their performance. Table S4 in the 
supplementary file summarizes the hyperparameters, their ranges, and 
the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

Helpful Answer:
The authors did not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they employed several strategies to optimize the hyperparameters of their machine learning models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Network. They utilized a randomized grid search method (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012), which helped them strike a balance between model complexity and the dataset while minimizing the risk of overfitting. By randomly selecting subsets of the parameter grid instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations, they reduced computational costs and found equally or more optimal solutions compared to an exhaustive grid search. The hyperparameters obtained after tuning each machine learning model for CHL-a, SD, and TSS are presented in Table 1. Although these optimization techniques do not directly address the issue of generalizability, they contribute to building robust and accurate models that could potentially perform better on unseen data.
