In this paper, the methods used were both intuitive (omitting missing 
values;  mean  imputation)  and  machine-learning-based.  These  proced-
ures and the FIT method are briefly presented below.  

• Control Group 

In the first experiment, the control group consisted of the unmodified 
datasets  of  each  species.  In  the  second  experiment,  we  defined  the 
control  group  as  the  geometric  profile  extracted  by  our  experienced 
operator.

To  further  enhance  the  Footprint  Identification  Technique  (FIT) 
method,  we  recommend  collecting  imperfect  footprints  when  high- 
quality  footprints  are  insufficient  during  field  surveys.  Instead  of  dis-
carding incomplete prints, we advocate using missing value imputation 
as  part  of  the  data  preprocessing  pipeline.  This  approach  preserves 
valuable data and improves the accuracy of FIT predictions when sub- 
quality footprints are included. Our findings are supported by a study 
using  deep  learning  models  to  classify  three  sympatric  otter  species, 
where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally 
outperformed  by  a  model  trained  on  high-quality  prints,  highlighting 
the  potential  of  utilizing  lower  quality  data  effectively  Kistner  et  al.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to a study using deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. It mentions that a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints. This suggests that some form of data augmentation might have been employed to improve the performance of the model trained on low-quality images. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the study, it is impossible to determine which specific data augmentation techniques were utilized.
