3.5. Workflow performance

We  used  the  keras  image_data_generator  function  for  image 
augmentation,  which  included  random  assignment  of  the  following: 
◦
rotation 0–40
, width and height shift range of 20%, shear range 0–0.2 
rad, zoom range 0–0.2 scalar range, a horizontal flip and a fill mode with 
the nearest pixel. 

We  trained  and  validated  the  image  quality  classifier  on  a  laptop 
(MacBook  Pro,  M1  Pro  8-core  central  processing  unit  (CPU),  14-core 
graphics  processing  unit  (GPU),  16GB  RAM),  using  the  GPU  rather 
than CPU for data processing. GPUs are optimized for complex imaging 
tasks and, in our case, outperform CPUs by ~7×.

Helpful Answer:
The given piece of context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, it mentions the use of the Keras ImageDataGenerator function for image augmentation, which includes several random assignments such as rotation, width and height shifts, shearing, zooming, flipping, and filling modes. These techniques help introduce variability into the dataset, making the model more robust and generalizable. While this doesn't directly address managing randomness through a fixed seed value, it demonstrates how randomness can be incorporated during training to improve model performance.

To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, one common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures reproducibility across different runs and allows researchers to compare results accurately. Another approach is to employ deterministic algorithms where possible, reducing the need for randomness altogether. In summary, while the given context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness via a fixed seed value, incorporating randomness through image augmentation techniques is a valuable aspect of building robust deep learning models.
