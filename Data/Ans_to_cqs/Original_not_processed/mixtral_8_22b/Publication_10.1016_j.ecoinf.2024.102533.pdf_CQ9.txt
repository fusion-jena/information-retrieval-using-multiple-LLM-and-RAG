we utilize 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness 
clusters for each species.

2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm. 

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the availability or location of the data repository used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific data repository used for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in E. Prasetyo et al.'s research paper published in Ecological Informatics volume 80 in 2024 with DOI 102533.
