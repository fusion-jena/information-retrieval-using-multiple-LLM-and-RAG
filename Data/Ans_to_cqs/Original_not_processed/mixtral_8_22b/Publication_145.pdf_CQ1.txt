Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing techniques and very high-resolution images, which suggests that satellite or airborne sensors might be employed for gathering such data. Additionally, the study focuses on mapping individual tree species in tropical forests, implying that field surveys could also play a role in acquiring ground truth data for training and validating the models. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively state what exact methods are being used for data collection in this particular case.
