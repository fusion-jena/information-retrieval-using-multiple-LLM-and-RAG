researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

The  snow  leopard  training  pipeline  described  here  may  be  repur-
posed rather quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system 
and  additional  data  is  submitted.  The  existing  model  may  also  help 
bootstrap that data-curation process. There is a considerable possibility 
for  regional  and  global  research  collaborations  with  snow  leopard 
research  institutions  to  curate  and  independently  identify  data  that 
would advance these existing models toward greater sophistication and 
improved performance. Deep learning systems have the ability to sur-
pass humans in the re-identification of animals, even in the absence of 
obvious patterns and markings, if sufficient datasets and collaboration

rithms. Two manual observers participated in exhaustive rounds of ID 
decisions in a process called graph matching of the 12,311 annotations, 
whereby  two  images  are  placed  side  by  side,  and  the  observer  de-
termines  whether  the  images  are  the  same  individual  or  different  in-
dividuals (same animal, different animal, cannot tell), and ranks their 
level  of  certainty  (undeniable,  certain,  somewhat  certain,  mostly  un-
certain, completely uncertain). This level of comprehensive individual 
ID enabled the subsets of our dataset to have the highest certainty for 
imagery from a field-based dataset.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques are often employed to minimize the loss function during the training phase of deep learning models. Without further information, I can only speculate that similar optimization techniques could have been utilized in this case.
