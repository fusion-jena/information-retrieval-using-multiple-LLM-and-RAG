The saturation varies significantly, in particular, from one survey to 
another  based  on  the  changing  conditions  as  mentioned  above  and 
demonstrated  in  the  technical  reports  in  the  supplements  with  many 
examples.4  Therefore, the designs of various ROC curves are based on 
the  several  most  important  sections  of  the  histogram  concerning  the 
distribution of the saturation, and Se and Sp values by determining the 
required number of dynamic cut-off points for increasing the Se and Sp 
values  significantly. Technically  speaking, i)  the mean  values  (μ) and 
standard deviations (σ) are acquired following the histogram of the S 
components are obtained from those 145 images mentioned earlier, ii)

Supplement_Blank are for blank images.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred that the performance metrics such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC) might have been used to evaluate the model during training. These metrics could help decide if the training should continue or stop. Additionally, the concept of dynamic cut-off points mentioned in the context suggests that the threshold for these metrics may have been adjusted during training to improve their values. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
