overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted

To  demonstrate  the  superior  performance  of  our  proposed  methods  compared  to  the  baseline 

methods, we first conducted experiments to assess the performance of five methods, comprising 

two baseline methods and three enhanced methods, using the VnPollenBee dataset. The results 

obtained are presented in Table 4 and Fig 14. 

It is evident that among the three improvements, the third enhancement (Faster RCNN + 

Overlap Sampler method) yields the most favorable outcomes. These results exhibit significantly 

higher performance compared to other methods across both Recall and MR, demonstrating robust 

stability across all measures. Despite the impressive results achieved by the classification network 

on  the  PollenDataset,  as  demonstrated  in  Section  5.2,  its  performance  in  pollen-bearing  bee 

detection  on  the  more  challenging  VnPollenBee  dataset  remains  suboptimal,  with  Precision,

the objects of interest. Conversely, weights are reduced for simpler samples. 

Consequently, focal loss diminishes the impact of straightforward samples on training loss 

while  amplifying  the  significance  of  challenging  ones.  The  focal  loss  function  is  calculated  as

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of focal loss as a solution to handle imbalanced datasets. Focal loss is a modified version of cross entropy loss that downweights easy examples and focuses training on hard negatives. It reduces the relative loss for well-classified examples and puts more focus on hard misclassified examples. By doing so, it helps alleviate the problem of class imbalance during training. Other common techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the given context.
