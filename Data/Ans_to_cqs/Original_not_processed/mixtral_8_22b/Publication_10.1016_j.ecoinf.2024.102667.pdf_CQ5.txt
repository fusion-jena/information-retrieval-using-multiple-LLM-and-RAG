2.2.3. Other data 

The land use/cover dataset for China featured a spatial resolution of 
1 km × 1 km and was acquired from RESDC. The dataset encompasses 
land use/cover information spanning the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. It covers six major land use/cover cate-
gories and twenty-six subcategories. Through a combination of manual 
and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, the primary 
land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the 
secondary  land  use/cover  categories  had  an  accuracy  exceeding  90% 
(Ning et al., 2018). In our research, the reclassified land use/cover types 
were categorized into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, 
construction land, water area, and unused land. The boundary datasets 
for  ecological  engineering  are  sourced  from  the  National  Ecological 
Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/). 

2.3. Methodology 

2.3.1. GSN change trend analysis method

Data  on  monthly  average  air  temperature  and  precipitation  from 
2000 to 2018 were sourced from the Resource and Environmental Sci-
ence Data Center (http://www.resdc.cn). Derived from daily meteoro-
logical  observations  collected  by  2472  national-level  meteorological 
stations situated throughout mainland China, this dataset employs the 
thin  plate  spline  interpolation  technique  of  ANUSPLIN  to  produce 
gridded precipitation and air temperature data with a resolution of 1 km 
× 1 km. The radiation data, with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, is an 8-day 
composite  dataset  of  net  land  surface  radiation  provided  by  Junbang 
(2021).  The  mean  air  temperature  and  overall  precipitation  for  the 
growing season of every year (March to October) were computed using 
cumulative  monthly  precipitation  and  average  air  temperature  data. 
Additionally, the mean net land surface radiation was computed for the

2.1. Overview of the study area 

2.2.1. NDVI datasets 

China’s  topography  is  characterized  primarily  by  mountains  and 
plateaus, with a gradual decline in elevation from west to east. Except 
for the southwestern and northwestern regions, most geographic areas 
are characterized by low altitudes. Based on the research requirements 
and  utilizing  the  boundary  data  provided  by  the  Resource  and  Envi-
ronmental Science and Data Center (RESDC) of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/), China has been segmented into nine 
major basin regions for our study, including Songhua and Liaohe River 
Basin,  Huaihe  River  Basin,  Haihe  River  Basin,  Yangtze  River  Basin, 
Yellow River Basin, Pearl River Basin, Southeast Basin, Southwest Basin, 
and Continental Basin (Fig. 2). China’s climate is diverse and complex, 
with  precipitation  gradually  decreasing  as  one  moves  towards  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no mention of any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses various scientific papers and their respective datasets related to environmental studies in China. These include land use/cover datasets, monthly average air temperature and precipitation data, gridded precipitation and air temperature data, and net land surface radiation data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
