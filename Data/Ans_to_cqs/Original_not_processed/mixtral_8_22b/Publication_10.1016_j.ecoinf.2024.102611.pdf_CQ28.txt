Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.8. Practical deployment 

Our  proposed  hierarchical  classification  model  exhibits  relatively 
less  computational  load  than  deep  learning  models,  showcasing  the 
potential of our new medicinal plant species classification framework. 
Further, it reduces the burden of manual efforts in accurately classifying 
a  plant  species  and  its  medicinal  benefits.  To  validate  the  practical 
deployment as a smartphone-based application, we assess the efficiency 
of  the  proposed  baseline  hierarchical  classification  model  using  two 
real-time datasets. Two experts validate the machine predictions of the 
proposed model. Conformity exists for more than 50% of samples be-
tween expert and machine predictions. Thus, only 75.46% of the sam-
ples from RTL80 and RTP40 are accurately predicted with the baseline 
hierarchical classification model.
