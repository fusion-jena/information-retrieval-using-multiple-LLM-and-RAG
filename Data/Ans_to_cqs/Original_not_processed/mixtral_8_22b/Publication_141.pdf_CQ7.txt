Fig. 3. Morphological characters of the training set used by the classiﬁer in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily level of taxonomic identiﬁcation. Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps with the relevant characters for each of the three models (red = most important region for classiﬁcation). The
percentages indicate proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classiﬁcation in the training set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. However, we can infer some details from the given context. For instance, there are percentages listed for accuracy, which could represent either training or validation accuracy. Additionally, there are numbers indicating misclassified images, possibly representing errors made during the validation or testing phases.

In general, when working with machine learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data is typically divided into three main categories: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the model.

Although the exact methodology used to divide the data isn't specified here, common practices include splitting the data into 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. Alternatively, k-fold cross-validation may have been employed, where the data is partitioned into 'k' equal parts, and each subset serves as the validation set once, while the remaining 'k-1' subsets form the training set.
