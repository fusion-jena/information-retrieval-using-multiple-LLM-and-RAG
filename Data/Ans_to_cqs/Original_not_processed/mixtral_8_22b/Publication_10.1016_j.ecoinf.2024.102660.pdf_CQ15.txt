2.5. Parameter setting 

The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. 
The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory, along with 
an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the 
network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, 
flips,  and  other  image  augmentation  operations  to  enhance  the  net-
work’s robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size 
set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate 
was  adjusted  using  the  equal-interval  adjustment  strategy  (StepLR), 
halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. 

2.6. Evaluation metric

network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

sun glint, this study reduces the number of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels 
in the convolutional block from 64 to 32, a measure taken to mitigate 
overfitting.  Additionally,  a  residual  structure  is  incorporated  into  the 
ResConv block based on the ResNet network (He et al., 2016). This in-
volves a series of operations: 3 × 3 convolution, batch normalization 
(BN),  rectified  linear  unit  (RELU)  activation  function,  followed  by 
another  3  × 3  convolution,  BN,  and  element-wise  addition  with  the 
output  of  the  initial  3  × 3  convolution.  Subsequently,  the  resulting 
feature map undergoes a secondary RELU activation function to obtain 
the convolutional feature results. Fig. 3(c) shows the Upsample block, 
responsible for restoring the feature map’s size to twice its original di-
mensions, comprising consecutive upsample, 3 × 3 convolution, BN, and 
RELU activation function operations.

total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the 
model  accuracy  during  the  training  phase,  and  356  image  pairs  for

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some details about the learning rate adjustment strategy used during the network training process. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. While this does not directly specify the use of specific optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it provides insight into how the learning rate was managed during the training process. Unfortunately, without more explicit information regarding the optimization algorithm employed, I cannot provide a definitive answer to which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
