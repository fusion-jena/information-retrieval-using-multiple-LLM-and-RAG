2.2. Footprint anatomy and geometric profiles 

The FIT method is based on tracks from a specific foot (left/right and 
front/hind) and therefore requires reliable distinction of left from right 
and front from hind tracks. Determining left versus right is well estab-
lished and relatively simple in fisher and marten due to the presence of a 
thumb pad  on the inner side  of the  print and  asymmetrical sizes and

linski and Truex (1995) to develop a discriminant model to distinguish 
sex in marten and fisher which correctly classified 98% of training and 
95% of test data using a model consisting of three measurement vari-
ables including interdigital pad height and width and total track length. 
While both of these methods provide robust outcomes with high levels of 
classification success, they involve a detailed and time-consuming hand 
measurement process for tracks that has prohibited widespread use.

3.4.1. Fisher and Marten species discrimination 

We found the best model for species discrimination between fisher 
and marten consisted of 12 variables and had near perfect classification 
success, only misclassifying 1 out of 532 tracks as the wrong species. 
However, as this full species discrimination model was so complex, we 
used backward stepwise selection to try to identify an effective model 
with fewer variables. We found a univariable model consisting only of 
variable V16 had a species classification success of over 99% only mis-
classifying  4/532  tracks  as  the  incorrect  species.  Based  on  this  single 
variable a track measurement where V16 > 3.17 has a 90% probability 
of  being  a  fisher.  The  discrimination  line  for  the  simple  species 
discrimination model is given by the Eq. (2): 

Species Discrimination Model : 28.853*V16 = 86.976

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., helps assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics can help determine if the model is performing well enough for its intended purpose.

2. Confusion Matrix: Creating a confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the model's performance. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing for easy identification of any patterns or biases in the model's predictions.

3. Cross-validation: Performing cross-validation ensures that the model generalizes well to new data. This involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on each fold while testing it on the remaining folds, and then averaging the results.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization strength, batch size, etc., can improve the model's performance. Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

5. Feature importance: Identifying important features can help understand what factors contribute most to the model's predictions. Methods like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, or LIME can be used to calculate feature importances.

6. Visualizations: Creating visualizations such as saliency maps, activation maps, or gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM) can help interpret the model's decisions. These visualizations highlight areas of input images that contributed most to the model's output, providing insights into how the model makes its predictions.
