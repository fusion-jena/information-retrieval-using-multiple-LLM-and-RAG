7,047,754 learnable parameters gave a F1-score of 84.93% which is even lower. CNN
architectures with many parameters (more than 20,000,000) such as ResNetV50 [38] and
InceptionNetV3 [39] gave a high training accuracy, but a lower validation F1-score of 69.1%
and 81.7%, respectively. This result indicates overﬁtting and that more training data are
needed when such large deep learning networks are used. A very high F1-score of 96.6%
was ﬁnally achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only
training the output layers. This indicates that the state-of-the-art was able to outperform
our proposed model, but requires pretrained weights with many more parameters.

2.2.4. Summary Statistics

Finally, the customized CNN architectures were compared with selected state-of-
the-art CNN optimized architectures. EfﬁcientNetB0 [36] is scaled to work with a small
image input size of 224 × 224 pixel and has 4,030,358 learnable parameters. Using the
moths dataset with the same data augmentation, the EfﬁcientNetB0 achieved a F1-score
of 88.62%, which is lower than our top ﬁve best architectures. DenceNet121 [37] with

To ﬁnd the best CNN architecture for species classiﬁcation, different hyperparameters
were adjusted as described in Section 2.2.3. A total of 64 architectures were trained using a
dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer. The average F1-score for all
classes was used as a measure for a given architecture’s performance.

The ﬁve best architectures had high F1-scores, which only varied by 0.02, but had a
varying number of learnable parameters (Table 2). Compared to SGD, Adam turned out to
be the superior optimizer for training of all models. In the end, the architecture that had
a rating among the three highest F1-score but the lowest amount of learnable parameters
(2,197,578) was chosen. The reason for this is that an architecture with many parameters
and few training data would increase the risk of overﬁtting the neural network.

The chosen model shown in Figure 5 had an F1-score of 92.75%, which indicated that
the trained CNN was very accurate in its predictions. This ﬁnal architecture was chosen
because it achieved average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, which indicated a
suitable model classiﬁcation.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer about whether GPUs or TPUs were utilized during the training process. However, considering the complexity of the models discussed, including those with millions of learnable parameters like ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3, it can be assumed that some form of accelerated computing hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, might have been employed to expedite the training process.
