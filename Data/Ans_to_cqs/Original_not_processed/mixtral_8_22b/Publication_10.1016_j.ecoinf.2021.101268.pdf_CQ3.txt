Deep Learning (DL) methods are at the top of the state-of-the-art on 
feature representation for different domains; albeit, DL lacks interpret-
ability. According to Doshi-Velez and Kim (2017), interpretability lets 
human specialists understand what a model is learning, making them 
flexible  real-world  solutions.  Given  such  topics,  this  paper  has  three 
significant contributions:  

1.  The  paper  introduces  the  first  Peruvian  Amazon  Forestry  Dataset, 
including  its  detailed  metadata  and  the  acquisition  protocol 
description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most 
profitable  and  endangered species (Finer  et al., 2014; Pinedo-Vas-
quez et al., 1992). Further-more, we employ six different commercial 
cameras  to  ensure  variability  and  to  develop  any  flexible  solution 
with real-world conditions in the future.

6. Discussion 

Traditionally, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 have been considered 
inside the top-models for general feature extraction task, especially the 
ones related with ImageNet Kornblith et al. (2019). Nevertheless, our 
quantitative  and  qualitative  evaluations  evidence  that  AlexNet  and 
VGG-19 are superior for The Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset since 
both derive high-quality abstractions. 

AlexNet achieves to extract shape, texture, and venation with some 
noise,  while  VGG-19  focus  strongly  in  shape  and  venation.  Conse-
quently,  VGG-19  has  remarkable  results  in  different  leaf  image  pro-
cessing tasks (Lee et al., 2017; Rizk, 2019; Thanh et al., 2018).

2. Peruvian Amazon forestry dataset

Figs. 6 and 7 show the visual representation of features when fine- 
tuning  with  raw  and  segmented  images,  respectively.  These  results 
bolster the ones gets in qualitative analysis (Table 4). AlexNet and VGG- 
19 learn high-level leaf features, such as venations and shapes (VGG-19 
more  than  AlexNet).  Moreover,  the  models  fine-tuned  with  the  raw 
dataset  fit  even  better  than  the  other  ones.  A  clear  example  of  this 
observation  is  the  ResNet-101  fine-tuned  with  pre-processed  images 
(Fig.  7).  This  model  has  learned  to  classify  based  on  lateral  sections, 
almost ignoring the leaf. So, the fine-tuned ResNet-101 probably have 
exploited an error in the background removal algorithm of some images.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset includes detailed metadata and describes the acquisition protocol. It also states that the dataset contains 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species. Additionally, the context discusses using raw and segmented images for fine-tuning the models. Based on these details, one can infer that the dataset might involve some form of image segmentation or object detection techniques, but the exact methodology remains unclear without further context.
