Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To evaluate the performance of both CNN-based models, we used these metrics [30]: precision

(Equation (1)), recall (Equation (2)), and F1-measure (Equation (3)):

Precision =

True positives
True positives + False positives

,

Recall =

True positives
True positives + False negatives
F1 − measure = 2 × Precision × Recall
Precision + Recall

where false positives represent the images that were classiﬁed by the models but actually corresponded
to another class, true positives represent the images that were correctly classiﬁed by the model, and false
negatives represent the images not detected by the model. In simple terms, the high positive predictive
value means that the model returned substantially better tree cover classes, while the high sensitivity
means that the model returned most of the actual tree cover. The F1-measure provides a balance

F1-measure in percentage. Y-axis represents the experiments of diﬀerent CNN-based models with the
classes Open forest (tree cover 10–40%), Closed forest (tree cover 41–65%), and Dense forest (tree cover

The increase in the size of the training dataset improved model performance. The most accurate
CNN-based model was obtained without the Non-Forest auxiliary class, using continuous tree cover
classes, and a larger number of training samples (see Table 1). This model reached the highest
F1-measure for Open Forest and Dense Forest, 71% and 79%, respectively. The CNN-based model with
the largest number of samples showed an increase in the F1-measure compared to the CNN-based
model with a smaller number of samples, up to 1% for Open Forest, and Dense Forest (Figure 2).

Helpful Answer:
Answer: To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, three metrics are used: precision, recall, and F1-measure. Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct. Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures how many of the actual positive cases are correctly identified. The F1-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation metric. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models in this study.
