Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The mean relative rank of each method for each performance index
is shown in Fig. 6. The ranking varied by correction type and the
number of presence sites. Concerning ΔDenv, Fenv was the best method,
followed by BGenv when the amount of presences sites was 20. When

k = 50, BGenv appeared to provide the best results in terms of ΔDenv
and ΔDgeo, even if this result does not appear to be signiﬁcant con-
sidering the dispersed values.

When the number of presence sites increased, BGgeo was ranked the
best in terms of ΔAUC, BGgeo, and Fenv in terms of ΔDenv, and Fgeo in
terms of ΔDgeo.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to present a new sampling bias eﬀect correction
method in the framework of species distribution modeling and to
compare it with other representative approaches of the literature.

The ranking results of the diﬀerent methods showed a variation of
relative evaluation indexes according to the number of presence sites,
and no correction method appears to be the best one. However, when
we focus on a small number of presence sites, BGenv regularly achieved
the ﬁrst or second rank regardless of the evaluation index used.

Three indexes were computed to quantify the relative impact of the

bias correction methods on model performances, as follows:

where x∈{Fgeo, Fenv, Bggeo, Bgenv}.
In the previous three equations, the value 1 stands for AUCUNB,
DenvUNB and DgeoUNB, i.e. the evaluation of the unbiased model output
compared with itself. In that sense, these indexes vary from −inf to 1. A
negative value indicates that the biased model outperformed the cor-
rected one, whereas a positive value indicates that the corrected model
outperformed the biased one; 1 shows that the corrected model was
perfectly corrected and was comparable to the unbiased one (Fourcade
et al., 2014).

plicates are shown by boxplots in Fig. 5.

Helpful Answer:

The text discusses a study comparing different methods for correcting sampling bias effects in species distribution modeling. Three indices are used to measure the relative impact of the correction methods on model performance: ΔAUCCx, ΔDenvCx, and ΔDgeoCx. These indices compare the performance of the corrected model to the original biased model and the ideal unbiased model. They range from negative infinity to 1, where a negative value means the biased model performed better, a positive value means the corrected model did better, and a score of 1 represents perfect correction.

However, the specific metrics mentioned in the query such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly discussed in the given context. Instead, the study uses Area Under Curve (AUC), environmental distance (Denv), and geographical distance (Dgeo) as performance indicators. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot directly state which traditional machine learning metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall are being used in this particular study.
