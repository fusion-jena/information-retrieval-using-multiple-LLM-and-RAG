undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

In addition to selecting the RS imagery and representative training 
samples, the choice of machine learning (ML) algorithm directly affects 
the accuracy of the classification results. Currently, a wide range of ML 
algorithms are extensively employed in LULC mapping, including sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) (Adugna et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2017), 
random forests (RFs) (Svoboda et al., 2022), decision trees (DTs) (Shih 
et al., 2018), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Amani et al., 2020; 
Hu et al., 2021). Researchers have frequently compared the accuracies 
of LULC maps derived from different classifiers (Shih et al., 2021). The 
RF  classifier  outperformed  the  other  ML  classifiers,  as  confirmed  by 
LULC (Shih et al., 2018; Yuh et al., 2023) and crop mapping (Inglada 
et al., 2015). RF has lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and stronger 
robustness against noise (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). Furthermore, RF can

image presegmentation. This retains the benefits of object-based clas-
sification  while  eliminating  time-consuming  parameter  adjustments 
required by traditional segmentation methods. Furthermore, it is worth 
highlighting that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform. 
This indicates that it can be easily applied to other regions or different 
study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC 
classification tasks. In future studies, the sample and vegetation index 
feature datasets should be continuously optimised. Furthermore, we will 
incorporate CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into the study of 
LULC mapping in arid zones.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that image presegmentation was used in the proposed method, which could potentially involve some form of semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) suggests that these models might require labeled data for training, but the exact type of labeling technique is not specified. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what specific data annotation techniques were used in this case.
