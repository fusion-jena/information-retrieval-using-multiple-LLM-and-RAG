Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned such as MLC, SVM, ANN, or RF. These hyperparameters could include learning rates, optimizers, batch sizes, number of epochs, etc. However, it should be noted that these parameters can vary depending on the specific implementation of each algorithm. For example, the learning rate would typically apply to gradient descent based optimization algorithms like those used in ANNs but may not directly apply to other types of classifiers like SVMs or decision trees which use different optimization strategies. Similarly, the choice of optimizer might depend on factors such as the complexity of the problem being solved, the amount of available data, and computational resources. Therefore, without more specific details about the implementations used in this study, it is not possible to definitively state what hyperparameters were employed.
