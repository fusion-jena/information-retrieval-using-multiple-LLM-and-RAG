5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not contain any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and prevent overfitting by introducing variations into the dataset. For example, image flipping involves creating mirror images of existing images, while rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Image scaling adjusts the size of images, either increasing or decreasing them, while cropping removes parts of an image to focus on a particular region. Zooming magnifies or shrinks images, while shearing distorts images along one axis. Translation moves images horizontally or vertically without changing their orientation. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.

Unhelpful Answer:
The given context does not mention anything about data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response to this query.
