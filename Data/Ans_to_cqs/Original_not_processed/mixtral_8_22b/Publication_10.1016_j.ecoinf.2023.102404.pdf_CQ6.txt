parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task. 
The  winning  parameters  are  as  follows:  numberOfTrees:  150,  min-
LeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps may be applied depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the nature of the input data. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points from the dataset. This step ensures that the model learns from high-quality data, which improves its overall performance.

2. Normalization: Scaling numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance or transforming them into a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]). Normalizing the data helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale differences, leading to better convergence during optimization.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve the model's understanding of the underlying relationships between variables. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables as binary indicators.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of input features to simplify the model and avoid overfitting. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), or autoencoders can be employed for dimensionality reduction.

5. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples by applying transformations like rotations, translations, flips, or noise addition to the original data. Data augmentation increases the size of the training set and enhances the model's robustness against variations in the input space.

6. Stratification: Ensuring that the training and validation sets maintain similar class distributions when dealing with classification tasks. Stratification helps prevent biased evaluations caused by imbalanced datasets.

In summary, preprocessing steps play a vital role in preparing the input data for deep learning models. These steps help improve the quality of the data, reduce computational costs, and increase the model's accuracy and generalizability.
