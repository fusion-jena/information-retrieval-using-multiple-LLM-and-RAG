maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

and processing. Precipitation, maximum and lowest temperatures, the 
agricultural land use factor (ALUF), the forest land use factor (FLUF), the 
grassland usage factor (GLUF), the shrub land use factor (SLUF), and the 
urban land use factor (ULUF) are all included in the input data. The land 
use factors are defined as follows: 

Urban Land Use Factor = arcsin

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the input data includes precipitation, temperature, and various land use factors such as agricultural land use factor (ALUF), forest land use factor (FLUF), grassland usage factor (GLUF), shrub land use factor (SLUF), and urban land use factor (ULUF). These factors suggest that the raw data might have been collected through remote sensing techniques, satellite imagery, or ground-based measurements. Additionally, the mention of catchment areas indicates that hydrological data may also be involved. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection methods, this remains speculative.

Based on the context, we cannot definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It would require additional information beyond what has been provided here.
