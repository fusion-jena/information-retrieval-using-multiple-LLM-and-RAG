Results

We  calibrated  models  for  classification  challenges  using  different  numbers  of  training 
steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 
2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except 
Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given 
the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. 
The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows:

Challenge 1

We  created  a  confusion  matrix  to  depict  TensorFlow’s  initial  results  with  20  species 
(Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94.3%. We achieved 100% correct iden-
tification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were 
for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct

Across broader taxonomic scales and phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Chan and Brown 
2017), other means (biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, classification, etc.) of restrict-
ing/limiting  candidate  species  pools  may  prove  useful  for  ‘fine-tuning’  of  TensorFlow’s 
automation of species recognition. Additional caveats for future consideration include (1) 
single notes per species and (2) sample sizes, which will be limited for rare species, those 
that occur at naturally low abundances, or taxa characterized by reduced detection proba-
bilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-lim-
ited  reproductive  cycles  (Wells  2010).  Avenues  for  future  development  of  these  methods 
in  our  immediate  plans  include  application  to  additional  taxonomic  groups  (e.g.,  insects, 
birds), and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor 
step to automated species identification.

Model architecture

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of DNNs that are specialized for image 
classification  tasks  and  pattern  recognition.  One  of  the  main  advantages  of  CNNs  is  the 
ability to perform automated feature extraction, eliminating the need for hand-crafted fea-
ture  extraction.  CNN  architecture  is  built  on  three  types  of  layers:  (1)  convolutional  lay-
ers,  which  are  the  most  important  because  they  apply  hierarchical  feature  extraction  and 
decomposition  of  input  images;  (2)  pooling  layers,  which  carry  out  operations  to  reduce 
numbers of parameters and necessary computation; and (3) fully connected layers, which 
perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline.

In  recent  years,  a  robust  group  of  classifiers  has  been  introduced  (Deep  Neural  Net-
works,  DNNs;  Schmidhuber  2015),  which  outperform  existing  methods  in  various  clas-
sification tasks (Ramcharan et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2019). One of the state-of-the-art DNN 
platforms  is  TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.  2016),  an  open-source  software  platform  designed 
by  the  Google  Brain  Team  (https ://www.resea rch.googl e.com/teams /brain ).  One  crucial 
advantage of applying TensorFlow is the Transfer Learning technique, which is a shortcut 
for achieving high-performance classification. This approach involves using a large dataset 
to train a model, and then re-training with a new calibrating dataset both to improve identi-
fication rates at lower computational cost.

Helpful Answer:

From the provided context, it appears that the authors used several strategies to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a subset of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), known for their ability to perform automated feature extraction, eliminating the need for hand-crafted feature extraction. This allows the model to learn relevant features directly from the data, improving its adaptability to diverse datasets.

Secondly, the authors mentioned using the Transfer Learning technique, a method where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a smaller dataset. This approach not only improves identification rates but also reduces computational costs. By leveraging this technique, the authors could potentially enhance the model's performance across a wide range of species, even when dealing with limited data for certain species.

Lastly, while the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques, the authors did consider two factors to determine the optimal number of training steps: correct identification rate and processing time. They tested different numbers of training steps and found that 4000 training steps worked best for most challenges, while 8000 training steps were needed for one specific challenge involving 41 species. This suggests that the authors might have used some form of validation process to evaluate the model's performance during training, although more specific details about the validation strategy are not provided in the available context.
