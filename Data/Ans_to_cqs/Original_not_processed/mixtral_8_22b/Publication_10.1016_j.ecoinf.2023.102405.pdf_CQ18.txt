niques to enhance the accuracy of water contamination classification in aquaculture. Real-time data collected 
through  IoT devices, encompassing parameters like temperature, pH levels, dissolved  oxygen, nitrate concen-
tration, and other water quality indicators, enables a holistic evaluation of water quality. By considering pre-
defined acceptable ranges for aquatic life, this framework calculates a water contamination index, facilitating the 
classification of data into categories such as contaminated and non-contaminated. To ensure robust classification, 
the study introduces an innovative attention-based model known as the Ordinary Differential Equation Gated 
Recurrent Unit (AODEGRU). This attention mechanism directs the model's focus towards salient features asso-
ciated with water contamination, while the AODEGRU architecture captures temporal patterns within the data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves initializing empty lists to store the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. During each epoch, the total loss and total correct predictions are initialized to zero. Then, the training data is randomly shuffled and split into mini batches of size ℎ. For each mini batch, the gradients of the model parameters are zeroed before being updated based on the calculated loss between the predicted labels and the true labels. After updating the model parameters, the total loss and total correct predictions are also updated. This process allows for tracking the progress of the model throughout the training phase.
