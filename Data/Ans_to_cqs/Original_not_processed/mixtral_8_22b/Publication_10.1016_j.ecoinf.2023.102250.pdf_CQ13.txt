number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

thereby limiting the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient 
and making the function smoother. This property ensures more stable 
parameter  changes  and  reduces  the  likelihood  of  gradient  explosion 
during neural network optimization, leading to improved training sta-
bility of the model. 

Spectral normalization(Miyato et al., 2018) achieved Lipschitz con-
tinuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each 
layer  of  the  network  in  the  discriminator.  This  approach  is  simple, 
efficient,  and  does  not  require  additional  hyperparameter  tuning. 
Therefore,  it  is  widely  adopted  to  train  stable  GANs(Li  et  al.,  2022a; 
Zhang et al., 2019a).

To  enhance  the  model’s  classification  accuracy,  we  replaced  the 
original 3 × 3 static convolutional kernel in the classifier with a dynamic 
convolutional kernel. The hyperparameter settings were kept the same 
as  in  the  previous  model.  We  compared  various  metrics  between  the 
original  model and  the  model with  the  added  dynamic  convolutional 
kernel structure, using different datasets. The specific experimental data 
can be found in Table 9. The experimental results demonstrated that the 
classifier’s accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score steadily increased 
with the dynamic convolutional kernel, while the Top1 error and Top5 
error steadily decreased. Fig. 13 depicts the comparison of accuracies 
achieved by the classifier with the dynamic convolutional kernel against 
the  original  one  on  the  three  datasets.  The  results  indicated  that  the 
classifiers with dynamic convolutional kernels exhibited improved ac-

The low classification accuracy of the neural network caused by the 
lack of birdsong spectrogram data can be solved by data augmentation 
of ACGAN. In addition, we can improve the feature extraction capability 
of the network by increasing its depth. However, increasing the network 
depth  may  lead  to  overfitting  and  require  significant  computational 
resources.  Some  researchers  have  proposed  dynamic  convolution  to 
solve  those  problems,  using  a  set  of  K  parallel  convolution  kernels 
instead  of  a  single  convolution  kernel  per  layer.  These  parallel  con-
volutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention. The atten-
tion  dynamically  adjusts  the  weight  of  each  convolution  kernel 
according to the input, thus generating an adaptive dynamic convolu-
tion. Experiments results show that this structure achieved a 2.9% gain 
in the Imagenet classification task and an AP gain of 2.9 in CoCo Key-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the hyperparameter settings were kept the same as in the previous model when replacing the original 3x3 static convolutional kernel in the classifier with a dynamic convolutional kernel. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model based on the given context.
