3.3. Network architecture 

The architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in 
“Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch” by github user “eelxpeng” 
(eelxpeng, 2018). As the size of our audio spectrograms has been con-
strained to 128 × 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each 
color channel to produce a greyscale image. For this initial experiment 
testing  the feasibility of using an auto-encoder-generated feature rep-
resentation for ecoacoustic analysis, we chose a basic auto-encoder ar-
chitecture  to  minimise  the  complications  that  may  be  introduced  by 
more advanced architectures. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) based acti-
vation function was be used, to help mitigate the vanishing/exploding 
gradient  problem  (Xu  et  al.,  2015).  Networks  using  implicit  pooling 
(determined using pytorch) and explicit max-pooling were used.

annotation  and  previous  use)  of  using  the  serf  dataset  outweigh  the 
problems caused by using an MP3 compressed dataset.

For  deep  learning  tasks  you  often  start  from  a  point  of  labelling 
training your data. However this can be slow and problematic. It can be 
useful to have a general representation for machine learning, that does 
not  rely  on  labeled  data  or  domain  specific  features.  This  paper  will 
focus on the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction. First 
we  will  explore  the  relevant  literature,  then  explain  our  method  for 
automatically learning features, our method for comparing with other 
feature  representations,  results,  and  finally  our  discussion  and 
conclusions. 

The outcome of this research is an alternative method for analysing 
eco-acoustic  data.  It  will  be  of  significance  to  the  fields  of  Machine 
Learning and Soundscape Ecology. This research will be of direct benefit

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio spectrograms constrained to 128 x 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a grayscale image. Therefore, the input data format used in the deep learning pipeline is essentially image data.
