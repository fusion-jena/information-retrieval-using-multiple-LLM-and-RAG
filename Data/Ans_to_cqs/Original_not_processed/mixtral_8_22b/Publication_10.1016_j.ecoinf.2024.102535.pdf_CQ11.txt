Due to its success in modeling complex problems, DL, characterized 
by neural networks encompassing more hidden layers and learning pa-
rameters  than  their  predecessors,  represents  a  promising  alternative. 
Additionally,  the  increasing  availability  of  optical  imagery  datasets 
organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps is very convenient for 
evaluating  the  performance  of  DL-based  techniques  in  deep-water 
studies. However, the limited availability of labeled data for properly 
training DL models in that context still remains a major obstacle.

The increasing availability of seabed images has created new opportunities and challenges for monitoring and 
better  understanding  the  spatial  distribution  of  fauna  and  substrata.  To  date,  however,  deep-sea  substratum 
classification relies mostly on visual interpretation, which is costly, time-consuming, and prone to human bias or 
error. Motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks in learning semantically rich representations 
directly from images, this work investigates the application of state-of-the-art network architectures, originally 
employed in the classification of non-seabed images, for the task of hydrothermal vent substrata image classi-
fication.  In  assessing  their  potential,  we  conduct  a  study  on  the  generalization,  complementarity  and  human 
interpretability aspects of those architectures. Specifically, we independently trained deep learning models with
