matching score and cross-correlation feature map of the classification 
branch. Finally, a refined classification confidence score was generated 
using a convolution operation. The refinement module effectively inte-
grated  the  relation  detector  into  the  Siamese  framework  to  suppress 
false-positive detections and filter background interference.

3.2.2. Comparison with other tracking methods 

Two metrics, namely, precision and success plots, are widely used to 
evaluate  object-tracking  algorithms.  The  precision  plot  evaluates  the 
center location error of the tracking algorithm. The higher the precision 
plot, the more accurate the center location. The precision plot denotes 
the  average  Euclidean  distance  between  the  centroid  locations  of  the 
tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths(Wu et al., 2015). 
We calculated the percentage of video frames considering the Euclidean 
distance  values  existing  within  a  specified  threshold(Babenko  et  al., 
2011).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention which specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss two metrics commonly used for evaluating object-tracking algorithms: precision and success plots. Precision is evaluated using the center location error of the tracking algorithm, where a higher precision plot indicates a more accurate center location. This metric calculates the average Euclidean distance between the centroid locations of the tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths. Additionally, the percentage of video frames is considered based on Euclidean distance values existing within a specified threshold. Although these metrics are mentioned in the context of object-tracking algorithms, they could potentially be applied or adapted to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model discussed in the given context.
