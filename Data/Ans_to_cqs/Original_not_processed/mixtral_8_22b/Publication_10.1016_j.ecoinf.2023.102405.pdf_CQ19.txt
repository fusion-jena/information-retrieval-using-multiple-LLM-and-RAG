Water contamination presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting the sustainability of ecosystems 
and  the  health  of  aquatic  organisms.  Precisely  assessing  water  contamination  levels  is  crucial  for  effective 
monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating 
water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. 
Integrating  computer  technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  and  Data 
Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have 
limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study 
proposes  a  comprehensive  framework  that  incorporates  IoT-based  data  collection  and  data  segregation  tech-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, common frameworks used for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to help developers create, train, and deploy machine learning models. Without further information, we cannot determine which framework was utilized in this particular case.
