The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

To enable adaptive image enhancement, a small CNN is employed to 
flexibly predict hyperparameters for image enhancement. Previous work 
by Guo et al. (2020) utilized unsupervised training to fine-tune the CNN- 
based  parameter  predictor  known  as  ZeroDCE.  However,  the  results 
demonstrated  that  it  did  not  enhance  the  accuracy  of  the  baseline 
YOLOv3 model in complex environments. This can be attributed to the 
fact  that  unsupervised  image  quality  improvement,  such  as  ZeroDCE 
(Guo et al., 2020), may not provide an absolute advantage in terms of 
detection performance. In contrast, our proposed method, along with IA-

In  the  image  signal  processing  pipeline,  image  enhancement  typi-
cally involves the utilization of several fine-tunable mappings, with their 
hyperparameters  adjusted  by  engineers  based  on  their  experience 
(Mosleh  et  al.,  2020).  However,  this  process  of  parameter  tuning  for 
different  scenarios  is  time-consuming.  To  overcome  this  limitation,  a 
recommendation  is  made  to  employ  a  compact  non-local  network 
instead  of  relying  solely  on  experienced  engineers  to  estimate  hyper-
parameters. This approach offers a faster and more effective solution. 
When  predicting  parameters  for  DIP,  the  NLPP  primarily  focuses  on 
capturing  the  large-scale  environmental  conditions  depicted  in  the 
image  rather  than  emphasizing  high-definition  details.  Therefore, 
downsampling the input images into the size of 256 × 256 using bilinear 
interpolation  is  sufficient  for  completing  the  parameter  estimation

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does discuss optimization algorithms like Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), and Adam. These optimization algorithms often involve hyperparameters such as learning rates or momentum coefficients. For instance, SGD might use a learning rate, while AdaGrad could have its own unique set of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, without further information, it isn't possible to specify exactly what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model described in the given context.
