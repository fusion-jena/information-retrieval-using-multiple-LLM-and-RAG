Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the two-step process that we demonstrated in the case study. Further-
more,  during  this  multi-step  process,  the  initially  inferred  sounds 
reviewed by experts can be fed back into the training data, which helps 
collect training data for rare species.

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2. 

3.4.2. Model inference and test datasets

2.4.1. Data transformation 

The labeled sounds in a recording are clipped and transformed into 
fixed-sized input images for model training. There are four data trans-
including  audio  standardization,  segmentation, 
formation  steps, 
augmentation, and spectrogram conversion. 

The  recordings  are  first  standardized  because  they  are  from  the 
community-contributed  collections  and  thus  may  be  recorded  with 
various recording equipment, settings and weather conditions. Because 
the frequency range of the labeled sounds in our database is between 
100 Hz and 16 kHz, we use a sampling rate of 32 kHz with a 100 Hz high- 
pass filter as the parameters for audio standardization.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. However, based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Nevertheless, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on common practices in machine learning projects.

One possible postprocessing step could involve evaluating the performance of the sound identification model using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, etc. These metrics help quantify how well the model performs in identifying different bird species accurately. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix would also provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, i.e., misclassifying one bird species as another.

Furthermore, generating saliency maps could be another potential postprocessing step. Saliency maps highlight the regions in the input spectrograms that contribute most significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. This information can aid in understanding why certain predictions were made and improve the overall interpretability of the model.

Lastly, feeding back the initially inferred sounds reviewed by experts into the training data, as mentioned in the context, can be considered a form of postprocessing. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement of the model by incorporating new training examples, especially for rare bird species.
