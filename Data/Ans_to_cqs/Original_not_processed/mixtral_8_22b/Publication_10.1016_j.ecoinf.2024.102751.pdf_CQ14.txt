method was used to estimate the model parameters, recommended by
the authors of the mgcv library (Ingrosso et al., 2023). Automatic
elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory
variable was chosen. The parameter ‘select = T’ indicated that the
smoothing parameter estimation, part of model fitting, could completely
remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. Due to the
skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC a gamma distribution
with natural logarithm as the linking function was used for modeling.
The accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed
using the ‘yardstick’ package for R, specifically the ‘metrics’ function.
Three selected model parameters were calculated: RMSE (eq. 1), MAE
(eq. 2), and R2. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in pre-
dictions without considering their direction. RMSE is more sensitive to
outliers as it squares residuals. R2 represents the proportion of vari-

2.3. ALS data

ALS point clouds were downloaded through the official website of
the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK), the Geoportal
for Spatial Information Infrastructure (https://www.geoportal.gov.pl;
Table 1). The portal provides free spatial data. Geoportal complies with
the INSPIRE Directive, an initiative to make spatial data available in
Europe, which aims to create a harmonized spatial information system
in the European Union (Directive 2007/2/EC 2007). The parameters of
ALS data are shown in Table 1.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that automatic elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory variable was chosen, indicating some form of feature selection process. Additionally, the'select = T' parameter suggests that smoothing parameter estimation during model fitting can completely remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. This implies that some sort of optimization technique might have been employed, but the exact method remains unclear from the provided text.
