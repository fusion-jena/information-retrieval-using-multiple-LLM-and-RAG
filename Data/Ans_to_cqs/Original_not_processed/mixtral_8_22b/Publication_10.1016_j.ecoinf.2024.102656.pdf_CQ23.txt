such  as  land  use  change  for  agriculture  and  afforestation,  road  con-
struction,  and  mining,  could  further  restrict  the  suitable  habitats  of 
ungulates (Ali et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2024).

The ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging 
approach,  assigning  weights  to  individual  models  based  on  their  pre-
dictive  accuracy  on  the  test  data  (Thuiller,  2014).  Evaluation  and 
comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and 
the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 
0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, 
and < 0.7 as poor (Eskildsen et al., 2013). Similarly, TSS values were 
categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4) 
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust 
understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of 

species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included various types of ungulate species such as wild goat, Urial, and Jebeer Gazelle. The dataset consisted of different features like Area of Core Habitats (km^2), Length of Roads Intersecting Core Habitats (km), and Percentage of Protected Core Habitats (%). Secondly, the ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging approach, where individual models were assigned weights based on their predictive accuracy on the test data. Lastly, evaluation and comparative analyses were performed for both individual models and the ensemble model through two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). These measures helped assess the model's performance comprehensively and ensured reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
