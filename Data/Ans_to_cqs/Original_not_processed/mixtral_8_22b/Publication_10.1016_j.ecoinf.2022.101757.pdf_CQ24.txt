To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the precision of object delineation in semantic segmentation. This technique helps compensate for the limited performance of neural networks in generating precisely delineated objects due to the loss of effective spatial resolution during the learning process. To evaluate the improvement gained from using CRF, the authors calculated the length of signals extracted with and without CRF and evaluated the gain length. While this approach doesn't directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it demonstrates a strategy for improving the accuracy of object delineation in semantic segmentation tasks.
