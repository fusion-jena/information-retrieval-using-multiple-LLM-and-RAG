The validated data is then loaded to the Access tier through an in-
cremental  ETL (extract, transform, and load) procedure acquiring the 
validated data from the Harbor tier. 

3.2.4. Analytical fruition

The results of these integration and enrichment activities are mate-
rialized in the Harbor tier of the data platform, which provides an in-
tegrated and comprehensive view of the available data at the finest level 
of detail. The relational schema of the integrated data is discussed in 
Appendix A.2. 

3.2.3. Validation and loading of enriched H. halys captures

In the following, we disclose all the details of the main data platform 
components, starting with the presentation of all data sources (Section 
3.2.1)  and  continuing  with  the  integration  and  enrichment  processes 
(Section 3.2.2), the validation and loading processes (Section 3.2.3), and 
concluding with the analytical fruition (Section 3.2.4). 

3.2.1. Data sources

The  paper  outline  is  as  follows.  Section  2  summarizes  the  related 
literature, Section 3 describes our approach in full details, and Section 4 
presents  the  obtained  results;  conclusions  are  drawn  in  Section  5. 
Finally, Appendix A digs deeper into the data and storage organization 
of the data platform.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the types of data being handled by the system.

From Table 1, we can see that the data sources include Monitoring Network, Satellite Images, Weather, and Environment. This suggests that the data could be in various formats such as text, numerical data, or images. Specifically, satellite images would likely be in a format suitable for storing visual data like JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.

Additionally, the mention of an incremental ETL process indicates that the data might need to be transformed before being loaded into the system. This could involve converting between different file formats depending on the requirements of each stage in the pipeline.

However, without more detailed information about the specific components and stages of the deep learning pipeline, I cannot definitively determine the exact data formats used.
