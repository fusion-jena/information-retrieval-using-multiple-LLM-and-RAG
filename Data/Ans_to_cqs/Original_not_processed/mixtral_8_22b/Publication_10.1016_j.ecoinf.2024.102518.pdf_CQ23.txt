feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

cross-validation. The threshold was derived from the average output of 
the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness 
(Fig. A.1).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the optimal model was determined based on the minimum delta.AICc value, which suggests that some form of model selection or evaluation process was used. Additionally, the use of cross-validation is mentioned when deriving the threshold from the average output of five models. This indicates that the model was tested on different subsets of data to assess its performance and avoid overfitting. While these are common practices to enhance the generalizability of a model, the text does not explicitly state whether diverse datasets or stratified splitting techniques were utilized.
