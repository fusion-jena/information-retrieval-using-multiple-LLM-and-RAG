shift and help to regularize our model as well. It consists of a parameterized
centering and reduction of pre-activations. This facilitates optimization and enables
to raise the learning rate leading to a quicker convergence. At the same time, it has
a regularization effect because the centering and reduction of a neuron activation
is linked to the mini-batch statistics. The mini-batch selection being stochastic at
every iteration, a neuron activation is stochastic itself, and the model will not rely
on it when it has no good effect on prediction.

10.3.5 Evaluation Metrics

• CNN is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one last layer fully
connected with 200 neurons, exactly similar to previous ones. The ﬁrst layer is
composed of 64 convolution ﬁlters of kernel size (3, 3) and 1 line of 0 padding.
The resulting feature maps are batch-normalized (same normalization for every
pixels of a feature map) and transformed with a Relu. Then, an average pooling
with a (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride is applied. The second layer is composed of
128 convolution ﬁlters of kernel size (5, 5) and 2 lines of padding, plus Batch-
Normalization and ReLU. After, that a second average pooling with a (8, 8)
kernel and (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride reduces size of the 128 feature maps
to one pixel. Those are collected in a vector by a ﬂattening operation preceding
the fully connected layer. This architecture is not very deep. However, considered
the restricted number of samples, a deep CNN would be very prone to over ﬁtting.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there are several regularization techniques mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. One such technique is Batch Normalization, which accelerates deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift. Batch Normalization consists of a parameterized centering and reduction of pre-activations, which facilitates optimization and enables raising the learning rate, leading to quicker convergence. Additionally, it has a regularization effect because the centering and reduction of a neuron activation are linked to the mini-batch statistics. Since the mini-batch selection is stochastic at every iteration, a neuron activation becomes stochastic itself, and the model will not rely on it when it has no good effect on prediction. Another regularization method mentioned indirectly is the use of a shallow neural network architecture instead of a deeper one. In this case, considering the restricted number of samples, a deep CNN would be very prone to overfitting. Therefore, using a simpler architecture with fewer parameters helps reduce the risk of overfitting. Other common regularization techniques like Dropout or L2 Regularization are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but could also be employed to further mitigate overfitting risks.
