2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

The linearity describes how elongated the adjacency is,
the planarity assesses how plane the adjacency is, the high-
scattering values are used to represent an isotropic and
spherical adjacency. We describe these three point features
as geometric features.

According to the pipeline of our framework, ﬁrst, we
compute the geometric partition. Then, each geometric
partition is converted into a superpoint. Next, we input the
superpoints in the SPG to a PointNet network for super-
point embedding. The ﬁnal operation is to segment the
point clouds based on context with a graph convolution
network. Therefore, the results of geometric partition have
a great impact on the semantic segmentation due to dif-
ferent superpoint caused by varying partition result.

We will discuss the regularization parameter l which
inﬂuences the coarseness of the partition. In formula (3),
the former term describes the ﬁdelity, and the latter is the
smoothness. The varying regularization parameter l causes
different partition results. Then, when we convert
the
partition to a superpoint, it will construct varied superpoint
graph, which is actually the neural network input.

The Structure of the SPG

Point Cloud Segmentation

First, we compute the geometric partition. Then, each
geometric partition is converted into a superpoint. Next, we
input the superpoints in the SPG to a PointNet network for
superpoint embedding. The ﬁnal operation is to segment
the point clouds based on context with a graph convolution
network.

We use PyTorch as the deep learning framework and
Ubuntu 16.0 as the experimental platform, and we ﬁnished
the experiments with 32 GB of memory and an NVIDIA
RTX 2070 GPU.

The main experimental pipeline of the experiments is as

follows:

1. Data pre-processing: We only use point coordinate
information in this algorithm, which corresponds to the
label of each point. We pre-process input data with
voxelization subsampling by computing per-voxel

mean positions and observations over a regular 3D
grid, which can help increase the computational
efﬁciency. After that, we convert the information and
labels into the hdf5 format.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, there are some clues that suggest the usage of specific models.

Firstly, the text mentions using a deep neural network for processing data. This could refer to any type of deep learning model, including CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Secondly, the mention of PointNet suggests that the model might be related to processing point cloud data, which is often associated with tasks like object detection, classification, and segmentation.

Furthermore, the context also refers to using Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for segmenting point clouds based on context. GCNs are typically used for processing graph-structured data, such as social networks or molecular structures. They can also be applied to point cloud data, where points are treated as nodes in a graph, and their relationships are represented by edges.

Lastly, the context mentions using PyTorch as the deep learning framework. PyTorch supports various types of deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. However, without more explicit information about the architecture of the deep learning model used in the pipeline, it is difficult to definitively determine whether it is a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
