Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to tree species classification, wetland extent trends, and other topics such as East African wetlands and ecosystem health using Earth observation and Sentinel-2 data. To find out about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, additional sources or context would need to be consulted.
