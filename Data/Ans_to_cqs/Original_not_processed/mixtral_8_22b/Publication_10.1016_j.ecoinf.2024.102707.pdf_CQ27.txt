%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors have made available the trained machine learning model along with the data and code used in their study. This suggests that they may have serialized the model into a format suitable for sharing or deployment. Common practices include saving models as binary files, pickle objects, or ONNX formats. As for platform selection, there is no mention of which platforms were considered or chosen for deployment. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide further details about the exact process followed for deploying the trained deep learning model.
