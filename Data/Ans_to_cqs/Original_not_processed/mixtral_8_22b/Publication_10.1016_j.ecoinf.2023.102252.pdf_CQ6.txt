Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the quality and usability of the input data. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It could also involve handling outliers or anomalous data points.

2. Normalization or Standardization: This is done to bring all features into the same range or scale. Normalization usually scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial because it helps prevent attributes with higher magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones during the learning process.

3. Feature Selection or Extraction: This step involves selecting relevant features or creating new features from existing ones to improve the performance of the model. Irrelevant features can negatively impact the model's accuracy and efficiency.

4. Data Augmentation: This technique is often used when dealing with image datasets. It involves creating new samples by applying random (but realistic) transformations such as rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. This can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. Therefore, these variables need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
