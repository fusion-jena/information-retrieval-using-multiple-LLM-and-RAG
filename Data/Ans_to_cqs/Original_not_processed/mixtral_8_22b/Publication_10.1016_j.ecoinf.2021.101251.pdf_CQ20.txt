Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

project. The resulting citation for the data collection can then be used to 
cite all of the resources in the collection.

Data  consumers,  particularly  modelers  and  machine  learning  de-
velopers, are utilizing data from many data packages and sources at a 
greater  pace  than  ever  before.  Citation  of  large  collections  of  data 
packages or specific integrated data within and across data packages is 
an  under-appreciated  challenge.  We  described  some  of  the  options 
currently available to repositories for providing integrated citations as 
well  as  their  pros  and  cons.  Which  option  is  best  depends  on  the 
particular  use  case.  In  all  cases,  these  options  have  the  potential  to 
enable a compact citation for a paper. However, both data collections 
and  especially  dynamic  data  citations  require  significant  specialized 
infrastructure and interfaces to be built at the repository to create them 
and  to  ensure  appropriate  credit  to  data  producers,  and  none  of  the 
options have seen broad universal adoption. Data papers are currently

A key element of data integration is enabling the use and citation of 
that  integrated  data.  In  this  paper,  we  have  considered  several  ap-
proaches (Scalable Dynamic Data Citation, data collections, data papers) 
that attempt to address some of the challenges. However, there is still a 
need  to  systematically  evaluate  the  complex  socio-technical  issues 
around data producers and data consumers. Data producers are quickly 
becoming  an  important  fabric  of  the  complex  scientific  ecosystem 
enabling  new  modeling  and  machine  learning/artificial  intelligence

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
