sample  the  feature  maps  to  reduce  dimensionality.  By  leveraging  the 
hierarchical  representations  learned  through  these  layers,  CNNs  can 
automatically  detect  and  recognize  complex  patterns  and  objects  in 
images. The training process of a CNN involves optimizing the network 
parameters using large-scale labeled training data through techniques 
such as backpropagation and gradient descent (Chouhan et al., 2020). 
Understanding the significant parameters related to CNNs is essential 
because they can drastically affect model performance. The convolution 
operation is meant to apply filters to the input image. It allows CNNs to 
extract local features and capture spatial relationships between pixels. 
The convolution operation is calculated with the help of eq. (3):

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the research primarily focuses on image data for deep learning tasks such as plant leaf classification, pine tree classification, and plant leaf disease classification. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video. Therefore, we can infer that the primary data format used in this study is images.

To provide more information about data formats used in deep learning pipelines, here are some common examples:

1. Images: Deep learning models often use images for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Common image file formats include JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP.

2. Audio: For speech recognition, music generation, and sound event detection, deep learning models may utilize audio files. Popular audio file formats include WAV, MP3, FLAC, and OGG.

3. Video: In video analysis tasks such as action recognition, motion tracking, and anomaly detection, deep learning models might employ video files. Some commonly used video file formats are AVI, MOV, MP4, and MKV.

4. Text: Natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization typically involve textual data. Plaintext files (TXT), PDF documents, and HTML web pages are frequently utilized in these cases.

5. Time series: Forecasting and anomaly detection tasks often require time series data. This type of data can come from sources like CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or databases containing historical records.

6. Structured data: Datasets with structured data, such as those found in relational databases or CSV files, can be used for tasks like fraud detection, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems.
