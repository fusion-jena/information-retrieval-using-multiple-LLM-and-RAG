learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

2)  Three  scenarios  were  established  based  on  identifying  service 
bundles: product supply, water conservation, and habitat maintenance. 
The  number  of  sources  was  11,  4,  and  4  for  each  type,  respectively, 
accounting for 37.6% of the total area of the region. Under these three 
scenarios, 30, 36, and 36 ecological corridors were identified and clas-
sified into five categories. 

3) In Guangzhou, the minimum area threshold for ecological sources 
is 10 km2. The CWD values for identifying ecological pinch points were 
20,000,  62,000,  and  93,000  for  the  three  scenarios,  while  the  search 
radii for ecological barriers were 320, 200, and 500 m.

and supported habitats, and are mainly composed of rivers, reservoirs, 
and ponds. Species migration corridors provide vital habitat support for 
animal migration.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, which is a type of unsupervised learning neural network, is being used for the identification of ecological sources.

In this case, the SOFM algorithm is applied to cluster research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles based on their spatial similarities. These ES bundles are then used to identify ecological sources and set scenarios. Additionally, hotspot analysis is employed to further analyze the spatial clustering of ecosystem service value (ESV) and determine optional ecological sources.

Therefore, although not directly mentioned, the primary function of the deep learning model in this context appears to be related to clustering and classification tasks, specifically for identifying and categorizing ecological sources based on their ecosystem services and spatial characteristics.
