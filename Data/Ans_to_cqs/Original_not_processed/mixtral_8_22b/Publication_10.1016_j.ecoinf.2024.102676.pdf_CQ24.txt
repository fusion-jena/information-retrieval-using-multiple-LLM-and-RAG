Regarding  the  usage  of  appropriate  imputation  methods  before 
applying the FIT algorithm, we recommend tree-based nonparametric 
imputation methods like missForest, missRanger or MICE RF. This is in 
line with recent findings on imputing before applying classification al-
gorithms  from  machine  learning  Buczak  et  al.  (2023).  According  to 
Breiman  (2001),  the  advantages  of  Random  Forests  are,  besides  the 
handling of mixed-type data, an accurate prediction performance under 
high dimensions and non-linear data structures. These are often found in 
real datasets and should be considered when imputing missing values. 
In  conclusion,  FIT  is  a  valuable,  non-invasive,  cost-effective  and 
highly applicable tool for wildlife conservation, which provides reliable 
data to inform wildlife management actions as required in Targets 4 and 
21 of the UN's Kunming-Montreal GBF 2022 Convention on Biological

missForest  is  a  Random  Forest-based  algorithm  developed  by 
(Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012), which imputes missing values itera-
tively using Random Forests trained on subsets of the dataset. In contrast 
to  the  standard  Random  Forest  methodology,  as  introduced  by  (Brei-
man,  2001),  where  the  focus  is  primarily  on  predictive  modeling  or 
classification tasks, missForest uses the Random Forest algorithm for the 
specific  task  of  imputation.  In  missForest,  each  variable  containing 
missing values is treated as a target variable. For every target variable, a 
dedicated  Random  Forest  model  is  trained,  utilizing  the  remaining 
variables as predictors. This targeted model is then employed to predict 
missing values within subsets of the dataset. This procedure is repeated 
with  the  updated  imputed  missing values  until a  predefined  stopping 
criterion  is  reached  Stekhoven  and  Bühlmann  (2012).  The  iterative

Missing values are then imputed by extracting random draws from 
the  model. The final  imputation is based  on observed values that are 
closest to the extracted random draws. Setting the number of potential 
candidates to k corresponds to the number of closest observed values, 
from  which  one  is  randomly  drawn  and  is  defined  as  the  imputation 
value. A completely different option is the usage of Random Forests (RF) 
for  imputation  in  MICE  Doove  et  al.  (2014).  The  latter  is  similar  to 
missForest but allows for additional variations by initially filling missing 
instances in the dataset with random draws, and then fitting Random 
Forest models iteratively throughout the different variables. Imputation 
is  then  conducted  by  randomly  drawing  observations  among  the  leaf 
nodes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and using deterministic algorithms whenever possible. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can help find optimal configurations that minimize the impact of randomness on model performance.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors recommend using tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF before applying the FIT algorithm. These methods use Random Forests, which have been shown to perform well in high-dimensional and non-linear data structures commonly found in real datasets. MissForest, specifically, is a Random Forest-based algorithm that imputes missing values iteratively using Random Forests trained on subsets of the dataset. Each variable containing missing values is treated as a target variable, and a dedicated Random Forest model is trained for each target variable using the remaining variables as predictors. This process is repeated until a predefined stopping criterion is met.

However, this information does not directly address the query regarding strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
