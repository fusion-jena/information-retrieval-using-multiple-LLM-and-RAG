Our  findings  also  revealed  a  significant  reduction  in  computation 
time when ML models, along with preselection, were used. Unlike ex-
pected, pre-selection lowered the accuracy of the results, which likely 
indicates  a  loss  of  information  in  the  database  transformed  using  the 
signature method. As we expected that the Lasso model, in the absence 
of the signature method, would not provide convincing results; there-
fore, we only retained this analysis to maintain consistency in compar-
ison with the ML models. Though it is possible to extract PDPs from RF 
runs  coupled  with  the  signature  method,  their  interpretation  is  not 
possible because of this transformation. The amount of input data, or in 
our case, the size of the time series used during the learning phase of an 
ML  model,  can  have  a  non-negligible  influence  on  predictive  perfor-
mance (Bustillo et al., 2022; Derot et al., 2020b). In other words, a long

the idea to implement a pre-selection method in our comparative anal-
ysis. For this purpose, we have used the Python function “SelectKBest” 
from the toolbox “Scikitlearn”. This analysis allowed us to see that, un-
like the LSTM and Lasso models, the predictive results of the RF model 
were not necessarily impacted by the signature. However, R2 was >0.5 
for all three models, with LSTM and Lasso models exhibiting the highest 
correlation coefficients.

Our comparative analysis enabled us to show that the best predictive 
performances  were  obtained  when  we  used  the  signature  method 
without pre-selection; with R2 equal to 0.79 and 0.74 respectively for the 
Lasso and LSTM models. Regardless of the forecast strategy used, the RF 
model had a fairly constant predictive performance, close to R2 = 0.6. In 
this  study  we  also  evidenced  the  following  threshold  values:

Helpful Answer:
The paper titled "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" discusses various methods for optimizing hyperparameters of machine learning models. However, the specific details about how the hyperparameters were optimized in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method were employed for hyperparameter optimization. It is recommended to refer to the original research article for more detailed information regarding the hyperparameter optimization process.
