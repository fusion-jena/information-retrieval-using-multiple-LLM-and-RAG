2.2. Field sampling and sample collection 

Four  field  campaigns  were  conducted  in  November  2018,  and 
January, April, and July 2019, under clear weather conditions except in 
July. A total of 119 water samples were collected (Fig. 1). Surface water 
(0.5 m depth) was gathered using clean polyethylene bags and promptly 
transported to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were categorized 
into two groups: one portion was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter 
for water quality parameter analysis, while the other was prepared for 
CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. This involved filtering through a 
◦
C, 3 h) Whatman GF/F filter and a 0.2 μm Millipore 
precombusted (450 
filter, followed by storage in 150 mL acid-washed amber glass bottles.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss the use of specific methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some aspects related to data collection in the context of environmental studies. In this case, the researchers conducted four field campaigns to collect water samples from different locations. They used clean polyethylene bags to gather surface water samples and transport them to the lab for further analysis. Additionally, they employed optical measurements and analysis techniques to retrieve information about total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration, and other parameters. While these methods may not be directly applicable to a deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate how researchers can collect and process real-world data for analysis.

In general, when working with deep learning pipelines, common methods for collecting raw data include:

1. Sensors and IoT devices: These tools can capture real-time data from various sources such as cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, or GPS devices. For example, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on sensor data to navigate and make decisions.
2. Public datasets: Many organizations and institutions provide open access to pre-existing datasets that can be used for training and testing machine learning models. Examples include ImageNet for image classification tasks, UCI Machine Learning Repository for various types of datasets, and Google's Dataset Search tool for discovering relevant datasets.
3. Surveys and questionnaires: Collecting human input through surveys or questionnaires is another way to generate labeled data for supervised learning tasks. Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk allow researchers to crowdsource labeling tasks to a large pool of workers.
4. Web scraping: Extracting structured data from websites can also serve as a valuable source of information for certain applications. Tools like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy help automate the web scraping process.
