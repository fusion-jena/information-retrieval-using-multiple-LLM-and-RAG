%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state which specific cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that there are reproducible scripts for training new models locally and on Google Cloud environments. This suggests that Google Cloud Platform might have been used for deployment or at least considered during development.
