On the same dataset, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020a) developed an 
encoder–decoder  based  deep-learning  model  to  estimate  seagrass 
coverage and achieved an mIoU of 90.66%. Perez et al. (Perez et al., 
2020) mapped seagrass distribution by applying a deep capsule network 
(DCN) and a deep CNN from the ‘WorldView-2’ satellite images at three 
different coastal locations in Florida. They showed that DCN and CNN 
models  performed  similarly.  They  also  demonstrated  that  these  two 
models performed significantly better than linear regression and support 
vector  machine-based  models.  Also,  in  2020,  Antoni  Burguera  (Bur-
guera,  2020)  mapped  Posidonia  oceanica  seagrass  by  developing  two 
neural networks (NNs); a convolutional layer based NN model achieved 
a precision of 97%, a recall of 95.4% and an accuracy of 95.5% on their 
dataset.  Burguera  (Long  et  al.,  2015)  visualised  the  patches  of

EffcientDet (Tan et al., 2020) was proposed by the Google Brain team 
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark Microsoft 
Common  Objects  in  Context  (MS  COCO)  dataset.  It  employs  the  Effi-
cientNet as its backbone which is a widely used feature extractor that 
integrates a compound scaling technique that uniformly scales the res-
olution,  depth  and  width  of  the  network.  Thus,  it  ensures  maximum 
accuracy and efficiency under limited computing resources (Kim et al., 
2021).  Based  on  the  model-scaling  technique,  different  models  of 
various dimensions are proposed with different accuracy and efficiency. 
The  EfficientDet  family  consists  of  a  series  of  networks  from 
EfficientDet-D0  to  EfficientDet-D7.  The  network  architecture  of  Effi-
cientDet is shown in Fig. 3. To allow easy and fast multi-scale feature 
fusion,  an  improved  PANet  named  bidirectional  feature  pyramid

H. ovalis) with a max stride of 32. It is worth noting that data augmen-
tation is a well-proven and common technique to avoid overfitting and 
to render a model generalised. We applied random cropping, horizontal/ 
vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness 
adjustment,  contrast  adjustment,  hue  and  saturation  adjustment, 
gaussian  noise,  random  erasing  both  of  our  models  training,  which 
helped increase the size and variability of our dataset.

Recently,  attention  has  focused  on  machine  learning  and  deep- 
learning algorithms to achieve these goals. Deep learning is a branch 
of machine learning and uses algorithms inspired by the function and 
structure of neural networks in the human brain (LeCun et al., 2015). An 
important  part  of  machine  learning  is  feature  engineering,  which  in-
creases  accuracy  and  requires  expertise  in  the  specific  domain  of  the 
problem. The deep learning approaches can perform feature engineering 
independently  by  itself  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Jalali  et  al.,  2022). 
Deep-learning are providing state-of-the-art performances of computer 
vision tasks such as classification, detection or segmentation (Kamilaris 
and Prenafeta-Boldu, 2018; Pouyanfar et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can share some general steps typically involved in deploying a deep learning model:

1. Model Serialization: After training the deep learning model, it needs to be saved for later use. This involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Common formats include pickle files (for Python),.h5 files (for Keras), or ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format.

2. Platform Selection: Once the model is serialized, it must be deployed onto a platform where it can receive input data and generate predictions. Depending on the application requirements, this could range from edge devices like mobile phones or IoT devices, to cloud servers, or even specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.

3. Inference Engine: A software component called an 'inference engine' is required to load the serialized model and execute it on new input data. Examples of popular inference engines include TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and OpenVINO.

4. API Development: For applications to interact with the deployed model, APIs need to be created. These APIs enable users or other systems to send requests containing input data to the model and receive the corresponding output predictions.

5. Monitoring & Maintenance: Post-deployment, it's essential to monitor the model's performance continuously and maintain it regularly. This includes tracking metrics like latency, throughput, and accuracy, as well as updating the model periodically with fresh training data.
