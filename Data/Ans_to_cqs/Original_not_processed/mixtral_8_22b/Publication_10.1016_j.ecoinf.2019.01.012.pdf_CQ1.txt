layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers (Voulodimos et al.,
2018). The ﬁrst two components are responsible for automatic feature
extraction by applying a large number of diﬀerent ﬁlters on the input
data. This process of feature extraction is performed on multiple levels,
whereby the output of each level is the input to the following. From
level to level, the extracted features increase in complexity - from rather
simple features (e.g. edges) on the lowest level to more complex fea-
tures on the highest level (Gu et al., 2018). By passing large quantities
of labeled training data through the network, the model successively
learns to recognize the relevant features, which are necessary to dis-
tinguish between classes.

Machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has evolved into
the most commonly used approaches for the automatic classiﬁcation of
digital images (LeCun et al., 2015). The major advantage of deep
learning is that the time-consuming and complex step of previous fea-
ture extraction becomes unnecessary. Instead, the model learns and
extracts the relevant features itself during the training process. The
major drawback of deep learning is that large amounts of labeled
training data are required (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to
extract spatial features. CNNs have proven to be quite powerful in
performing diﬀerent tasks such as object detection (Everingham et al.,
2010; Tompson et al., 2014), classiﬁcation (Traore et al., 2018, Xu

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that labeled training data is required for deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for image analysis. Labeled training data typically consists of input data along with its corresponding correct output or label. For example, in image classification tasks, this could involve providing images along with their respective labels indicating the objects present within them.

While the sources of these labeled training datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, common methods for obtaining such data include manual annotation, crowdsourcing, and utilizing existing public datasets. Manual annotation involves human experts manually assigning labels to the dataset, while crowdsourcing leverages contributions from a large group of individuals to generate labels. Public datasets refer to collections of pre-labeled data made available for research purposes, often compiled by organizations or institutions.

In summary, although the exact methods for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it can be assumed that labeled training data is essential for developing deep learning models like CNNs. Common ways to obtain this data include manual annotation, crowdsourcing, and employing publicly accessible datasets.
