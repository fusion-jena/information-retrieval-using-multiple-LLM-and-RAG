The selection of appropriate parameters for model tuning is crucial 
when constructing predictive models. While it is widely acknowledged 
that  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  the  random  forest,  excel  at 
handling multicollinear data, the inclusion of irrelevant variables can 
significantly diminish model performance. Furthermore, the choice of a 
variable elimination method should be made with careful consideration, 
considering the representativeness of the training data in relation to the 
broader environmental conditions to which the model will be extrapo-
lated. Our study demonstrates that a variable elimination method that 
emphasizes retaining variables on how well they reduce the prediction 
error yields more reliable (based on known tsetse belts; McCord et al., 
2012) results compared to methods that retain variables solely based on 
their  importance  in  explaining  the  training  data.  Furthermore,  future

prevent  potential  performance  degradation  of  the  model  and  avoids 
overfitting, which can limit the ability to make good extrapolations to 
unseen regions (Duque-Lazo et al., 2016). In this study, we employed 
two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: 1) RFE 
(Recursive  Feature  Elimination,  Khun,  2022)  and  2)VSURF  (Variable 
Selection Using Random Forests; Genuer et al., 2022). In RFE, the user 
defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algo-
rithm  iteratively  removes  one  variable  at  a  time  while  evaluating  its 
impact  on  the  model’s  performance.  This  process  continues  until  the 
algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In 
this study, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination 
condition. As a result, RFE retained all variables whose removal led to a 
deterioration in the best RMSE value. VSURF follows a three-step pro-

Forests (VSURF; Genuer et al., 2022; Speiser, 2021; Speiser et al., 2019). 
RFE  retains  variables  based  on  their  importance  in  explaining  the 
response variable (Khun, 2022), while the VSURF method goes a step 
further  by  assessing  how  these  important  variables  contribute to  pre-
dicting  the  response  variable  and  retains  only  those  that  lead  to  a 
reduction in prediction error (Genuer et al., 2022). To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to develop random 
forest models for predicting relative tsetse fly numbers by integrating in- 
situ  tsetse  catches  with  satellite-based  variables.  Furthermore,  the 
impact of different feature elimination techniques on tsetse predictions 
has not been assessed previously.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques help in reducing the number of input features or variables, but do not directly address the optimization of hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization strength, etc. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or another optimization technique was used for hyperparameter tuning.
