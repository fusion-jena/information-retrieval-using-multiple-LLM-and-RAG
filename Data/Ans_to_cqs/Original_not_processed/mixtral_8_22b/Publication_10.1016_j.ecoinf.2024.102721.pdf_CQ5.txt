Where Φi is the SHAP value of feature i. The larger the SHAP value,
the greater contribution of the feature to the prediction; S is the set of
features; (S ⊆ N\i)denotes the subset that excludes feature i; N is the set
of all features; f is the prediction function of the model; f(S) is the pre-
diction result of the model on the set of features S; |S| denotes the
number of elements in set S.

2.3.3. LSTM model

The LSTM model is a type of machine learning model that is derived
from recurrent neural networks (RNN). Its special memory unit effec-
tively addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for
long-term sequences. The structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The LSTM memory unit comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate,
and hidden layer. Signals are transmitted between different units
through three control gates in the hidden layer, determining which in-
formation should be stored, read, and written. Because of the precise
control of information by gate structures, LSTM can effectively learn in
long time sequences and is well-suited for time series prediction.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain images and their corresponding labels, which are often used for training and testing various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Without further context or information, it cannot be determined which dataset was used in this particular study.
