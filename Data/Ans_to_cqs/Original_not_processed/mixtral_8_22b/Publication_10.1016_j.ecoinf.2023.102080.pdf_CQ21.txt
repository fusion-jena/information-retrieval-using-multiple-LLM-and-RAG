Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3.4.3. Computation time 

The overall average computation time for running both the covariate 
selection procedure and model fitting steps was ~1.5 time higher with 
the embedded procedure compared to the two alternatives (Fig. 4.A), 
which is the same order of magnitude as the gain in model accuracy. 
However, models from the embedded procedure were faster to fit (Fig. 4. 
B), presumably because the more relevant the covariate set, the faster 
the algorithms converged.

Fig. 4. Average computation time (seconds) for the 50 species needed for (A) running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under each of 
the three main covariate selection procedures (“embedded”, “filter”, and “random”), and (B) model fitting only under each of the three main covariate selection 
procedures and by modelling algorithm (GLM: Generalized Linear Model, GAM: Generalized Additive Model, and RF: Random Forest). Wilcoxon tests were used to 
assess statistical significance in differences between methods with ****: p < .0001; ***: p < .001; **: p < .01; *: p < .05; ns: non-significant.

windows of 100-m, 500-m, or 1-km radii), (ii) the category level (e.g.: 
within thematic covariate categories), and (iii) using all remainders.

We compared the average computation time needed for (i) running 
the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under 
each of the three main procedures, and (ii) model fitting only. Analyses 
were run using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD® 
EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there isn't enough information to provide a detailed response regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, I can share some general insights about common postprocessing steps often employed in machine learning projects. These may include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

2. Confusion matrices: Constructing confusion matrices to visualize the performance of classification models, which helps identify false positives, true negatives, false negatives, and true positives.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to understand feature importance and how different features contribute to the final prediction. This technique is particularly useful when working with image data.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning hyperparameters based on cross-validation results to improve model performance further.

5. Model interpretation: Explaining predictions made by complex models like random forests, gradient boosted trees, or neural networks using techniques such as SHAP values, LIME, or partial dependence plots.

6. Ensemble modeling: Combining multiple models to create a single ensemble model that leverages the strengths of individual models.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps, and their applicability depends on the specific use case and requirements.
