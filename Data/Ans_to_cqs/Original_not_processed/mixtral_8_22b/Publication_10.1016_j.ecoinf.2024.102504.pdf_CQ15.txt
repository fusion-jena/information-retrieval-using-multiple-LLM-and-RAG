days ahead, suggesting the potential for reliable early-warning systems 
based  on  automated  monitoring  stations  and  real-time  ensemble  pre-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad). These methods help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. Without explicit mention in the given sources, it is impossible to determine which optimization technique was employed in each case.
