unbiased model and the corrected one arise more likely from the cor-
rection methods than from the random selection of the sites. Thus, the
chosen parameterization appeared the most appropriate by achieving a
good compromise.

equally biased (Phillips et al., 2009). This is achieved by transforming
the model input data using four approaches which can be categorized
according to two criteria: i) the dataset concerned with the transfor-
mation (presence sites or background sites); and ii) the implementation
spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).
When the presence dataset is considered, the authors aim at modifying
its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the back-
ground set is obtained via a uniform random selection. The im-
plementation space of such an approach is either the geographical space
(see for example Boria et al., 2014; Kramer-Schadt et al., 2013) or en-
vironmental feature space (see Fourcade et al., 2014; Varela et al.,
2014). This approach seems to be eﬀective, but requires many presence
sites (Fourcade et al., 2014). When the background set is considered, it
is built according to a selection bias that reﬂects the same sampling bias

Moreover, the number of presence sites used to build the SDM is
often limited because of the scarcity of the species or the inadequate
number of species records. Thus, many datasets suﬀer not only from
sampling bias, but also from a low number of presence sites.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its development process. However, it discusses the issue of sampling bias in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and how this affects their performance. To address this problem, several correction methods are mentioned. These include transforming the model input data using four different approaches based on whether they modify the presence dataset or the background dataset, and if they operate in geographical or environmental spaces. One method involves modifying the distribution of the presence dataset towards a uniform distribution, while another builds the background set according to a selection bias reflecting the same sampling bias. While these techniques help improve the performance of SDMs, they require a large number of presence sites, which may not always be available due to factors like species rarity or insufficient species records. Therefore, despite efforts to enhance the robustness and applicability of SDMs, limitations persist due to inherent challenges in obtaining diverse and representative datasets.
