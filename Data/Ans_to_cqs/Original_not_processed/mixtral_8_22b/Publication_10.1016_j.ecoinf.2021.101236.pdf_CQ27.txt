overall process mostly followed current best practices in deep learning 
which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017).

Here  we  present  a  new  algorithm,  called  BirdNET,  that  builds  on 
these previous successes using CNNs and spectrogram data to classify 
984  bird  species.  We  discuss  the  necessary  steps  required  to  develop 
such a system and provide insights into our training and testing work-
flow of a deep artificial neural network. Finally, we give an outlook on 
how  this  technology  can  support  ornithologists  and  conservation  bi-
ologists in their work to identify and address the environmental chal-
lenges of our time. 

2. Methods

followed  the  original  Wide  ResNet  design.  Our  downsampling  blocks 
employed the changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). The third and final 
component, the classification block, was derived from (Schlüter, 2018) 
and resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second (i. 
e., three predictions per 3-s input spectrogram) followed by global log- 
mean-exponential  pooling  and  sigmoid  activation.  Most  convolutions 
use 3 × 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normali-
zation  (Ioffe  and  Szegedy,  2015)  and  ReLU  activation  (if  not  noted 
differently).  Because  we  treated  spectrograms  as  monochrome  input 
images, the input was a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, 
visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. 

2.5. Training

2. Methods 

Our overall workflow for training a deep neural network consisted of 
the acquisition of large amounts of audio data, the pre-processing of this 
data to generate visual representations of sound, the augmentation of 
these visualizations, and, finally, the training of a complex model ar-
chitecture with ~27 million trainable parameters. We ran inference on 
independent validation and test splits of the acquired data and applied 
our model to continuous soundscape recordings, which are part of an 
ongoing monitoring project in Ithaca, NY, USA.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it is mentioned that the model was run on independent validation and test splits of the acquired data and applied to continuous soundscape recordings. This suggests that some form of deployment was carried out to use the trained model for these tasks. Without further information, it cannot be determined exactly what process was followed for deployment.
