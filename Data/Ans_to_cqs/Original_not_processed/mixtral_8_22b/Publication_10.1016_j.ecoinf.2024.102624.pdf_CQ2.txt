Altogether, we had 17 variables (spectral bands: green, red, red edge, 
NIR; spectral indices – NDVI, vNDVI, NDRE, DSM, and nine variations of 
the  texture  index, Run  Percentage, with three  kernel  and three  offset 
options in all combinations). We applied different input datasets using 
combinations of possible variables (Fig. 2 and Table 2). We also deter-
mined the most important variables based on the largest OA with the 
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method. RFE is a variable selection 
method that can be combined with machine learning algorithms and we 
used the RF. RFE removes the variable with the lowest contribution from 
the input set to achieve the highest overall accuracy stepwise: first, the 
weakest variable is removed and continues until only one variable (with 
the  highest  contribution)  remains.  We  applied  the  RFE  in  two  steps 
(Chen et al., 2018; Rasel et al., 2021): (i) first we determined the best-

Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

Helpful Answer: The article does not explicitly state the specific file format used for the input data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of data used, including Near Infrared (NIR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference RedEdge Index (NDRE), visible NDVI (vNDVI), and Digital Surface Model (DSM). These are typically represented as numerical arrays or matrices, often stored in formats like.csv,.txt, or.npy for Python NumPy arrays. Additionally, the use of UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) suggests that images might have been used as well, likely in common image formats such as.jpg,.png, or.tiff.
