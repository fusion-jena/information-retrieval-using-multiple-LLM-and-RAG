Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution as it had the best values for IoU and accuracy
while training on fewer epochs. The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 4 and described in
the following.

2.5.1. Encoding Path

encoding and decoding blocks and are summarized in Table 1. These experiments were monitored
using TensorBoard and validated on the validation portion of the dataset.

During our study, we tested different hyperparameters to ﬁnd an optimal setting for our problem.
The different parts of our ﬁnal architecture, as well as the tested hyperparameter settings are described
in the following.

2.4. Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the neural network, several evaluation metrics were used. Evaluation
metrics were computed during the forward pass, and were not subject to maximization, but were
rather used as a performance indicator. This helped to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
In this study, we used a custom implementation of the intersection over union metric. It computes the
intersection of the reference dataset and the predicted classiﬁcation and divides it by the union of the
two (Equation (1)). In addition, we calculated the overall accuracy of the model (Equation (2)).

IoU =

TP
TP + FP + FN

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + FN + FP + TN

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred from the statement "These experiments were monitored using TensorBoard and validated on the validation portion of the dataset" that the dataset was indeed divided into at least two portions - one for training and another for validation. Typically, datasets are also further divided into a testing set to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling or stratified sampling based on the distribution of classes in the dataset. Without additional context, it cannot be determined which method was used in this case.
