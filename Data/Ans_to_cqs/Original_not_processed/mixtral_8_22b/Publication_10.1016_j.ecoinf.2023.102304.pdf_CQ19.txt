higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

MS defines the maximum number of segments used for fitting. RT 
(cid:0) 1 in this study) defines the threshold of the fast recovery event. 
(unit: yr
A  simple  disturbance-recovery  pattern  usually  consists  of  four  phases 
(stable-decrease-recovery-stable).  In  that  case,  an  MS  value  of  4  is 
appropriate to describe the temporal pattern and reduce the impact of 
noise in the time series. In a complex recovery situation, more segments 
may be required. RT has a value between 0 and 1. A higher value makes 
the model less likely to miss a fast recovery while more likely to cause a 
false positive error.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model based on the given context.
