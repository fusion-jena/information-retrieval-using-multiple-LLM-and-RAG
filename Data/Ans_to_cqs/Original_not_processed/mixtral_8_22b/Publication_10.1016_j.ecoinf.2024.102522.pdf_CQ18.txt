From Table 11, the correct prediction rate for “present” was 76.84%, 
the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 77.55%, and the 
overall  validation  accuracy  was  76.17%.  The  results  showed  that  the 
accuracy  of  the  model  in  predicting  the  “present”  sample  points  was 
>70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%. The 
model  was  effective,  and  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  model  was 
slightly  greater  than  that  of  the  model  based  on  remote  sensing  data 
without the introduction of nighttime light information. 

3.3.3. Pattern of Hyphantria cunea spreading

As shown in Table 6, the correct prediction rate for “present”  was 
74.81%, the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 76.55%, 
and the overall validation accuracy was 75.68%. These results showed 
that the accuracy of the model in predicting the “present” sample points 
was >70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%, 
indicating that the model is effective (Carranza and Hale, 2000).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from Tables 3, 4, 8, and 9 that the authors might have been using log-likelihood values, Cox & Snell R^2, Nagelkerke R^2, and classification tables to evaluate their models. Additionally, they could also use cross-validation techniques or holdout methods to assess the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the original source, this remains speculative.
