There were two main data sources assembled within a database and
used for the fieldwork/analysis: (1) archaeological survey data from the
Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) (Dagan, 2006) for LTA-LU; and (2)
remotely sensed data (spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-
toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENμS), airborne Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for LC. Addi-
tional ancillary data was required for establishing research control,
georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas, including (1) digital maps
from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC (M.O.
A., 2023); (2) georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of
Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area (S.O.I.,
2018); (3) substrate data for geology, from the Israel geological survey
(I.G.S., 2010, 2016), and soil (Ravikovitch, 1969); (4) climate-related
data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S., 2023) and the US

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this case. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the available information. It would be best to refer to the original source or contact the authors directly for more details regarding the data repository link.
