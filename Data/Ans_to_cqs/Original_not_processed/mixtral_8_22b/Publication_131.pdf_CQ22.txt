Fourth, at the level of resources, the application that runs the CNN takes 16.4% of the
CPU capacity and 8.7% of RAM. These results let us conclude that the available computing
resources are adequate for running this sort of application.

The overall accuracy results obtained for the ﬁrst network, which classiﬁed the sounds
in four classes, were 96.34% for training and 97.53% for the test data. The confusion matrix
for the test data in this network is detailed in Table 2.

The dispersion of the error between the four classes is low, standing between 1.21% for
the Alytes obstetricans class (11 errors versus 913 audios) and 4.9% for the Epidalea calamita
class with amplexus vocalization (7 errors versus 143 audios).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To evaluate the performance of the first deep learning model, the authors use the metric of overall accuracy. They report a score of 96.34% for training and 97.53% for testing data. Additionally, they provide a confusion matrix for the test data, which shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. This allows them to see how well the model performs on individual classes and identify any potential biases or weaknesses in its classification abilities. However, it should be noted that other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are not mentioned in the given context.
