In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

attention  mechanism  is  embedded  in  the  backbone  of  the  YOLOv5 
model because it is more convenient and drives the overall performance 
of  the  system.  Moreover,  the  main  feature  extraction  is  done  in  the 
backbone.  Therefore,  if  SENet  is  embedded  in  the  backbone,  it  can 
extract more features and enhance the performance of the model. This is 
the key aspect of the present work. 

The  SENet  attention  mechanism  comprises  squeeze  and  excitation 
operations.  The  architecture  of  the  SENet  attention  mechanism  (Hu 
et al., 2019) is shown in Fig. 4. In the mechanism, the residual block is a 
stack of layers that takes a convolutional block as input and adds the 
output of the convolutional block to a deeper layer (He et al., 2016). The 
global pooling block squeezes each channel into a single numeric value

The  global  average  pooling  is  used  in  the  squeeze  step  to  lower  the 
spatial  dimension  of  the  input  feature  maps,  which  results  in  a  com-
pressed  representation of those maps. Once again, during the  time of 
excitation, channel-wise dependencies are represented by modelling the 
interdependencies  among the  compressed feature maps  that were ob-
tained from the squeezing step. The term “excitation layer” refers to the 
two layers that are completely coupled to one another. The channel-wise 
attention  weights  are  produced  once  the  excitation  block  has  been 
processed. When everything is done, scaling and rescaling are accom-
plished by multiplying the attention weight by the initial feature maps. 
This reduces the weight of the channels that are not important while 
increasing the weight of the channels that are significant. As a result of 
this,  the  model’s  performance  can  be  improved  by  increasing  the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or task of the deep learning model, such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. However, we can infer that the model is likely designed for object detection due to its use of the YOLOv5 architecture, which is primarily known for real-time object detection tasks. Additionally, the mention of anchor boxes and Intersection Over Union (IoU) thresholds further supports this assumption since they are commonly associated with object detection models.

Therefore, we can conclude that the primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is most likely object detection.
