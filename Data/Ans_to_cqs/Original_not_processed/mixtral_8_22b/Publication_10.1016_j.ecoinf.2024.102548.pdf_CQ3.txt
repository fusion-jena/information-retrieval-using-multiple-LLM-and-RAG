3. Deep learning techniques 

In the Deep Learning section, we delve into the technical aspects of 
our  model.  We  utilize  RNNs  to  effectively  capture  sequential  de-
pendencies in the data. RNNs, such as LSTM and GRUs, allow our model 
to retain and propagate information from previous steps, enhancing its 
understanding of sequential patterns. Additionally, we employ transfer 
learning  techniques,  initializing  our  model  with  pre-trained  weights 
from  large-scale  datasets  like  ImageNet.  This  transfer  of  knowledge 
enhances  the  modelâ€™s  performance  by  leveraging  learned  representa-
tions  from  related  tasks.  Detailed  explanations  and  implementation 
specifics of RNNs and transfer learning are provided in the subsequent 
subsections.

3.2.4. ResNet-50 

ResNet-50 is a widely used deep residual neural network architecture 
that addresses the challenges of training very deep networks. It employs 
residual blocks with skip connections to enable the flow of gradients and 
facilitate the training of deeper models. ResNet-50 has been pre-trained 
on  large-scale  datasets,  allowing  it  to  capture  complex  patterns  and 
achieve strong performance.

InceptionV3 

InceptionV3 is an advanced CNN architecture that incorporates the 
concept of inception modules. These modules utilize parallel convolu-
tions  of  different  kernel  sizes  to  capture  multi-scale  features.  Incep-
tionV3  has  been  pre-trained  on 
large-scale  datasets  and  has 
demonstrated  excellent  performance  in  various  image  classification 
tasks.

4.2. Data augmentation 

Data augmentation is a pivotal technique used to enhance the per-
formance  and  generalization  capability  of  deep  learning  models  by 
augmenting  the  training  dataset  with  artificially  generated  variations 
(Wu et al., 2017). Therefore, there are many augmentation techniques in 
the  literature  applied  especially  for  the  diagnosis  of  several  diseases

InceptionResNetV2 

InceptionResNetV2  is  a  fusion  of  the  Inception  and  ResNet  archi-
tectures,  combining  the  benefits  of  both  networks.  It  incorporates  re-
sidual  connections  and  parallel  convolutions  to  capture  fine-grained 
details and high-level features simultaneously. InceptionResNetV2 has 
been  pre-trained  on  extensive  datasets,  enabling  it  to  learn  compre-
hensive feature representations and achieve high performance.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotations, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images, which can be useful for object detection tasks. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class label, providing more detailed information about the spatial layout of objects within the scene. Instance segmentation combines elements of both object detection and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and labeled separately. Without further context, it cannot be determined which specific data annotation techniques were used in this particular study.
