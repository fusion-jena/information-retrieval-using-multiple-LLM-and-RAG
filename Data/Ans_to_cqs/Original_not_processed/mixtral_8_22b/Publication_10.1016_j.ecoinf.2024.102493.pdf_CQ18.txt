The Q value, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver in 
the OPGD, is also influenced by the size of the OPGD data sampling grid. 
It is common to compare the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers 
at different spatial scales and select the optimal sampling grid based on 
the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest(Song et al., 2020; Yu 
et al., 2023). In this paper, Q values for each driver were compared at 
grid scales of 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km, 3 km*3 km, 4 km*4 km, 5 km*5 
km and 6 km*6 km.

time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

2.3.3. Optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD)  

(i)  Optimal scale and discretization parameters 

As OPGD requires continuous data to be discretized before further 
analysis,  choosing  appropriate  discretization  parameters  (i.e.,  the 
number and method of discretization breakpoints) is crucial for accurate 
identification  of  driver  explanatory  power.  The  discretization  process 
involved  five  methods:  standard  deviation  (SD),  natural  breaks  (NB), 
equal  interval  (EI),  quantile  (QU),  and  geometric  interval  (GI)(Song 
et al., 2020). Following previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 
2023), we considered that too many or too few breakpoints would result 
in  information  redundancy  (insufficiency).  Therefore,  the  number  of 
breakpoints was configured to range from 4 to 13 in this study.

where Q represents the explanatory power of each driver factor on the 
spatial variability of the kNDVI, with values ranging between [0,1]. A 
higher Q value indicates a stronger ability of the influencing factor to 
explain the kNDVI, and vice versa(Wang and Xu, 2017). L denotes the 
number  of  strata  for  each  driver  factor,  and  Nh  and  N  represent  the 
sample size of each driver factor within stratum h and the entire region, 
respectively. σ2and σ2
h  represent the total variance in the whole region 
and the variance in the kNDVI in the h-th stratum, respectively. SSW and 
SST represent the square sum of the kNDVI within stratum h and the 
square sum across the entire region, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the Q value, which measures the explanatory power of each driver in the OPGD, could potentially serve as an indicator of model performance. By comparing the Q values for each driver at various grid scales, the optimal sampling grid can be selected based on the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest. This approach might indirectly help monitor the model performance during training. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the monitoring strategy, it cannot be definitively stated what exact method is employed to track the model performance during training.
