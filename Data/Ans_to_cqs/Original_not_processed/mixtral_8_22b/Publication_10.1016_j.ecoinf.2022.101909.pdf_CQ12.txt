2.7. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning-based 
model 

We implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) (LeCun and 
Bengio, 1995) to perform the automatic task of detection and identifi-
cation of 18 classes. A CNN is a type of network inspired by the visual 
cortex that shows good performance in recognizing objects in images, 
and  its  use  has  been  extended  to  the  acoustic  domain  (Aloysius  and 
Geetha, 2017; Stowell, 2022). The architecture is organized according to 
a hierarchy of layers designed for feature extraction based on a digital 
image. The first layers can detect edges, then simple shapes, and deeper 
layers can learn more complex shapes with a high level of abstraction 
(Albawi et al., 2017; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015).

The  implemented  CNN  corresponded  to  a  modified  version  of 
ResNet50, one of the dominant architectures in bioacoustic tasks, and, 
although other authors have applied previous ImageNet training to the 
bioacoustic  domain  (LeBien  et  al.,  2020;  Zhong  et  al.,  2021),  other 
datasets such as Audio Set (Gemmeke et al., 2017) or VGG-Sound (Chen 
et al., 2020) can be just as good as ImageNet for pre-training, either on 
ResNet or on other architectures, such as VGGish, Inception or Mobile-
Net. Another viable option is to pretrain with synthetic clicks or chirps 
(Glotin  et  al.,  2017;  Yang  et  al.,  2021).  Models  already  available  in 
mobile  apps  that  perform  this  same  spectrogram-based  identification 
task are advancing rapidly. To date (October 2022), the BirdNet appli-
cation (Kahl et al., 2021) allows for the identification of more than 3000 
bird species (Wood et al., 2022). In the short term, this particular model

We applied the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the 
deep learning model ResNet50 (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018), which 
was already pre-trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Transfer 
learning is a technique that enabled us to overcome the issue of shortage 
of  training  data  and  construct  a  model  efficiently  by  transferring 
knowledge  from  a  similar  task  to,  in  this  case,  our  target  task.  The 
implemented  architecture  received  RGB  images  of  224×224×3  as 
inputs—in this case, color spectrograms of two-second durations—and 
included  only  the  feature  extraction  layers  from  the  ResNet50,  dis-
carding the superior classification layers (known as the top network). 
The newly created model reconfigured the top network with two fully 
connected  layers  (FC)  that  could  learn  new  features.  To  reduce  over-
fitting and imitate the training of a set of different models, a dropout

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The pipeline uses a type of deep learning model called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it employs a modified version of the ResNet50 architecture, which is known for its strong performance in various tasks, including those within the bioacoustic domain. This model was chosen due to its ability to effectively extract features from input data, making it well-suited for tasks like object recognition in images and, in this case, identifying specific sounds in audio recordings.
