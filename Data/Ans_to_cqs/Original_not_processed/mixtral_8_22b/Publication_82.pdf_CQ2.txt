Approach
We evaluate the applicability of deep convolutional neural
networks for the classiﬁcation problem described above. We
focus on two popular architectures, namely AlexNet (Krizhevsky
et al., 2012), and GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), which were
designed in the context of the “Large Scale Visual Recognition
Challenge” (ILSVRC) (Russakovsky et al., 2015) for the ImageNet
dataset (Deng et al., 2009).

30/3 epochs),
• Momentum: 0.9,
• Weight decay: 0.0005,
• Gamma: 0.1,
• Batch size: 24 (in case of GoogLeNet), 100 (in case of AlexNet).

All the above experiments were conducted using our own fork of
Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for
deep learning. The basic results, such as the overall accuracy can
also be replicated using a standard instance of caﬀe.

of classes in our dataset), which feeds the softMax layer. The
softMax layer ﬁnally exponentially normalizes the input that it
gets from (fc8), thereby producing a distribution of values across
the 38 classes that add up to 1. These values can be interpreted
as the conﬁdences of the network that a given input image is
represented by the corresponding classes. All of the ﬁrst 7 layers
of AlexNet have a ReLu non-linearity activation unit associated
with them, and the ﬁrst two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7})
have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout
ratio of 0.5.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific file format used for storing or processing the datasets. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the datasets used in this study are images. This is evident from the mention of color and grayscale datasets, as well as references to deep convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline would likely include common image file formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.
