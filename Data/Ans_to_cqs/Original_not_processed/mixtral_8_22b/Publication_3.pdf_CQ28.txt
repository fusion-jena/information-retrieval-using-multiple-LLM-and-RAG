Model architecture

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of DNNs that are specialized for image 
classification  tasks  and  pattern  recognition.  One  of  the  main  advantages  of  CNNs  is  the 
ability to perform automated feature extraction, eliminating the need for hand-crafted fea-
ture  extraction.  CNN  architecture  is  built  on  three  types  of  layers:  (1)  convolutional  lay-
ers,  which  are  the  most  important  because  they  apply  hierarchical  feature  extraction  and 
decomposition  of  input  images;  (2)  pooling  layers,  which  carry  out  operations  to  reduce 
numbers of parameters and necessary computation; and (3) fully connected layers, which 
perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline.

(2) how does TensorFlow perform when it encounters species that do not exist in its 
reference library? To answer these questions, we generated 20 spectrograms per spe-
cies for this new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to 
identification using the CNN developed in Challenge 1.

3.  Challenging TensorFlow to identify all 41 species for which recordings are available 
We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by add-
ing 21 new, undescribed species (one species in the new dataset was already present 
in reference library, owing to a recent taxonomic change; Brown et al. 2015b). Then, 
we followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference 
library that is twice as large as the original (i.e., 41 classes).

Deep neural networks

TensorFlow’s flexible architecture allows easy adaptation and deployment on different plat-
forms  including  desktops,  clusters  of  servers,  edge  devices,  and  mobile  phones  (https ://

(48), and is already trained on more than a million images.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow has a flexible architecture that allows easy adaptation and deployment on various platforms, including desktops, clusters of servers, edge devices, and mobile phones. Therefore, without additional context or information, it cannot be determined which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
