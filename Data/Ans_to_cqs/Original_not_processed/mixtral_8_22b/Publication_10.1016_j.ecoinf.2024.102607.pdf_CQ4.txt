that larger sample sizes improved the classification accuracy, but with 
larger improvements when the initial sample size was small.

To address the problem of unbalanced training data, scholars have 
explored  various  sampling  techniques,  including  major  category

undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

image presegmentation. This retains the benefits of object-based clas-
sification  while  eliminating  time-consuming  parameter  adjustments 
required by traditional segmentation methods. Furthermore, it is worth 
highlighting that the proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform. 
This indicates that it can be easily applied to other regions or different 
study years, making it a versatile and accessible tool for RS and LULC 
classification tasks. In future studies, the sample and vegetation index 
feature datasets should be continuously optimised. Furthermore, we will 
incorporate CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into the study of 
LULC mapping in arid zones.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based on the available context. However, the context discusses several approaches to improving the accuracy of land use/land cover (LULC) mapping using remote sensing (RS) data. It mentions the use of larger sample sizes, undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both to address the issue of imbalanced training data. Additionally, it highlights the introduction of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to enhance the accuracy of LULC mapping. Image presegmentation is also mentioned as a technique to retain the advantages of object-based classification without requiring time-consuming parameter adjustments. Lastly, the text suggests incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) deep-learning algorithms into future studies for LULC mapping in arid zones.
