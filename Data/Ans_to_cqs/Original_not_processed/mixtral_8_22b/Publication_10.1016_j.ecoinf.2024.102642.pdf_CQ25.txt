During  the  campaign,  methods  are  proposed  to  assess  inter- 
annotator  variability  and  aggregate  annotation  sets.  Those  methods 
will help to define the minimal number of annotators needed [Dubus 
et al., 2023; Walter et al., 2022]. Increasing the number of annotators 
per sample could be helpful if the variability is too high. Finally, the two 
grouping  methods:  majority  voting  (Section  2.2.3)  and  soft  labeling 
(Section 2.3.2) can also be used to produce relevant annotation sets for 
deep learning. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study, new approaches were explored to improve the accuracy 
and  efficiency  of  cetacean  vocalization  detection  using  deep  learning 
models. Leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert 
and novice annotators aimed to address the challenges associated with 
the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater PAM studies.

distinctive  annotation  profiles  influenced  by  the  complexity  of  vocalizations  and  the  annotators’  strategies, 
ranging from conservative to permissive. To address the challenges of annotation discrepancies, Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and the expert. The results show varia-
tions in model performance. Our work highlights the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more 
conservative  approach  to  improve  overall  annotation  quality.  In  an  effort  to  optimize  the  potential  of  multi- 
annotation  and  mitigate  the  presence  of  noisy  labels,  two  annotation  aggregation  methods  (majority  voting 
and  soft  labeling)  are  proposed  and  tested.  The  results  demonstrate  that  both  methods,  particularly  when  a 
sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability:

However,  it  has  been  observed  that  annotation  sets  used  to  train 
models qualified as “permissive annotators” get lower performance than 
the ones qualified as “conservative annotators”  even with comparable 
F1 score with the annotations from the experts. Gu et al. (2023) also 
proposed that at the same ratio of noise on the training set, the model’s 
performance can decrease differently regarding the type of noise. In this 
study,  it  seems  that  simple  convolutional  neural  network  models 
generalize better from the most obvious examples and the introduction 
of false positives deteriorates the performance more than the omission of 
a vocalization in the annotation set. For future annotation campaigns, 
this  result  might  suggest  that  instructing  annotators  to  adopt  a  more 
conservative approach could be beneficial.

In a second part, CNNs were trained based on the annotation from 
each annotator to assess the impact of the inter-annotator variability (i. 
e., the uncertainty regarding the noise on a labeled dataset) on models 
for automatic detection. All models are evaluated on datasets different 
from  the  one  used  for  training,  in  terms  of  recording  devices, 
geographical  areas  and  annotator  that  produced  the  annotation  for 
pseudo-ground  truth.  The  performances  of  those  models  are  then 
assessed by taking into account the agreement between the annotations 
of novices and those of the expert.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. This suggests that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to detect or identify cetacean vocalizations within audio recordings. Additionally, the study mentions leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. This implies that the deep learning model may also classify or categorize these detected vocalizations based on their characteristics or features. However, without explicit confirmation, it should be noted that the main objective of the deep learning model appears to be focused on improving cetacean vocalization detection rather than other tasks such as segmentation or generation.
