2.2.1. RS data 

The primary data used in this study consists of monthly averages of 
five  Copernicus  Sentinel-5  Precursor  vertical  column  density  (VCD) 
products, which include measurements of SO2, NO2, O3, HCHO, and CO.

factories 

Power plants can emit significant amounts of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere ( 
Pandey, 2020). Furthermore, the 
combustion of furnace oil or diesel in power 
plants produces substantial amounts of 
sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) (Kouravand and Kermani, 2018). 
Landfills can contribute to air pollution by 
releasing dust and gases such as methane 
(CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and etc. ( 
Iravanian and Ravari, 2020).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context only provides details about various studies related to air quality prediction using different methods like deep learning LSTM, self-made passive samplers, and satellite images. It also mentions some pollutants emitted from sources like power plants, landfills, petroleum refineries, steel factories, lime/plaster factories, concrete/cement plants, and asphalt/sand factories. However, it does not provide any specific information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
