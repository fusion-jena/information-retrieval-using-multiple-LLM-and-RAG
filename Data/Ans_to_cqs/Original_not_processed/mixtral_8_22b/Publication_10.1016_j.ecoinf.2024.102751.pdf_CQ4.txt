Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.

Where yi is actual value, yp is predicted value and ‘n’ is number of

observations.

The values of predictors were finally extracted for the whole study
area in a regular 10 × 10 m square grid and used for wall-to-wall pre-
diction of VWC using the developed GAM model. Figures showing the
spatial distribution of predicted VWC, and its standard error were
created.

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model by creating variations of existing samples. For instance, image flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing the pixels of an image; rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree; scaling changes the size of the image; cropping cuts out parts of the image; zooming magnifies the image; shearing distorts the image along one axis; and translation shifts the position of the image within the frame. Each technique can be applied individually or combined with others to generate diverse variations of the original sample.

Note: The helpful answer does not provide information directly from the given context but instead provides a general explanation of data augmentation techniques commonly applied in deep learning pipelines.
