5.3.3. Results analysis and comparison 

The integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classification  algorithms  (see  (Bansal  et  al.,  2022; 
Boateng  et  al.,  2020)),  along  with  a  Principal  Component  Analysis- 
Support  Vector  Machine  (PCA-SVM)  hybrid  approach  (Hai  and  An, 
2016), has significantly enhanced our understanding of zebrafish and rat 
movements within T-maze environments. This comprehensive analysis, 
as  detailed  in  Tables  3  and  4,  showcases  the  detailed  insights  gained 
from these methodologies. For zebrafish, the KNN model demonstrated 
high precision and recall in identifying left movements, with impressive

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. These metrics provide different perspectives on how well the model performs.

Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions made by the model out of all the positive predictions it makes. It can be calculated as True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives). High precision indicates low false positive rate.

Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model. It can be calculated as True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives). High recall indicates fewer missed detections.

F-Measure combines both precision and recall into one single measure. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. A higher value of F-Measure indicates better performance.

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model. It is calculated as (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions. However, accuracy alone may not give a complete picture when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In such cases, other metrics like precision, recall, or F-Measure should also be considered.

For instance, in the given context, the performance of KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM models in classifying the left-right movements of zebrafish and rats is compared using Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. The results indicate that each model excels in certain aspects. For example, KNN shows high precision and recall in identifying left movements of zebrafish, while SVM outperforms in precision and recall for left movements. On the other hand, PCA-SVM achieves remarkable accuracy rates after reducing dimensionality before classification.
