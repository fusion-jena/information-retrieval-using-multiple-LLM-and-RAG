Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

24.  Which features will you need for data preprocessing?  

• Data deduplication (Eliminating excessive copies of data)  
• Data  cleansing  (Removing  incorrect,  corrupted,  incomplete 

data)  

• Data transformation (Changing the structure or format of data)  
• Data compression (Modifying or converting the bits structure 

of data)  

• I do not know  
• Not applicable  
• Other  

25.  In data processing, which one do you choose?  

• Using well-labeled training data (Supervised)  
• Combining  labeled  with  unlabeled  training  data  (Semi- 

supervised)  

• Using unlabeled training data (Unsupervised)  
• I do not know  
• Not applicable  

26.  What kind of data analytics do you need?  

• To know what happen (Descriptive analytics)  
• To know how something happen (Diagnostic analytics)  
• To know what will happen (Predictive analytics) 
• To  know  what  should  be  done  if  something  happens  (Pre-

scriptive analytics)

there are two types of data processing: batch and stream processing. 

3.2.2.6. Data  visualization. This feature provides the way how the in-
formation is presented to the end-users. There are two common purposes 
of developing  visualization systems  in the  smart system  to help users 
identify the trend of data or the pattern of data. The data visualization 
types  were  also  considered  to  deliver  insightful  information  to  users 
(Krisnawijaya et al., 2022). There are three types of visualization based 
on the generated information from the system, such as temporal infor-
mation  (represented  by  using  a  line  graph  or  scatter  plot),  multi- 
dimensional information (using a pie chart, Venn diagram, bar graph, 
or  histogram),  and  geospatial  information  (using  heat  or  flow  map).

2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various data formats could be utilized depending on the application domain and requirements. Commonly used data formats include images, audio files, videos, and structured data like CSV files. Images are often used in computer vision applications, while audio files may be employed for speech recognition or music analysis tasks. Video data might be relevant for object tracking or action recognition projects. Structured data like CSV files can contain numerical or categorical values suitable for tabular datasets. Ultimately, the choice of data format depends on the problem being addressed and the available resources.
