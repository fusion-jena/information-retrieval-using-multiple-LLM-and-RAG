Fig. 8. Estimation of the energy consumption related to the training of the models. This corresponds to the sum of CPU energy, GPU energy and RAMenergy in 
kilowatt-hour (kWh). Fine-tuning of four CNN backbones (i.e. ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121 and AlexNet) were accomplished on 5 way-1 shot (Left) and 5 way-5 
shot (Right) tasks using Matching Networks (MN), Prototypical Networks (PN) and Relation Networks (RN).

pretrained DenseNet might fit the Darksound dataset well, but there are 
no  guarantees  that it  will  work  on  another  dataset in  the  exact  same 
manner. All the CNN backbones used in this experiment were previously 
trained on the ImageNet database, a large but very general dataset. It has 
been recently shown that using features extracted from models trained 
on smaller but more specific datasets, that bird sound datasets, leads to 
higher quality classification (Ghani et al., 2023; McGinn et al., 2023). 
Consequently, using features extracted from a model trained on spec-
trograms of bird sounds (e.g.  BirdNET algorithm (Kahl et  al., 2021)), 
could  improve  the  parameter  initialization  of  UML  algorithms  of  the 
MEC method.

3.3. Comparative analysis of CNN backbones 

Comparative  analysis  of  CNN  backbones  was  accomplished  to 
determine  the  optimal  CNN  architecture  to  use.  Original  feature 
extraction part of the meta-learning algorithms was replaced with four 
CNN  pretrained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset,  that  is  ResNet18,  VGG16, 
DenseNet121 and AlexNet. Recent work has shown that the addition of 
pretrained networks can improve the classification (Yang et al., 2020). 
The selection of pretrained CNNs was based on the ranking of standard 
off-the-shelf CNN architectures used in the context of eco-acoustics with 
DL  (Stowell,  2022)  to  highlight  their  energy  consumption.  Other  ar-
chitectures  such  as  DNN  models  optimized  for  embedding  systems 
requiring  low  power  consumption  (Velasco-Montero  et  al.,  2018)  or 
traditional  audio  feature  extraction  (Lakdari  et  al.,  2024)  could  be 
investigated further in the future.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether the code repository is available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
