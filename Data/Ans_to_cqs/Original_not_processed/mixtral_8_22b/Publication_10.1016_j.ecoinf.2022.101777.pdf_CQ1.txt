Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about data collection methods for machine learning and deep learning applications, some common methods include:

1. Surveys or Questionnaires: These can be used to collect labeled data from human participants, which can then be used to train supervised models. For example, in natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, survey responses can serve as training examples with positive or negative labels.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can be employed to gather real-world data for different applications. In computer vision tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation, cameras can capture images or videos containing objects of interest. Other sensor types may include accelerometers, gyroscopes, temperature sensors, etc., depending on the application domain.

3. Public Datasets: Existing datasets available online can also be leveraged for training deep learning models. Some popular sources include UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle competitions, ImageNet, COCO dataset, etc. Using pre-existing datasets can save time and resources compared to gathering new data through other means.

Without more specific details regarding the context, it is difficult to determine exactly which method(s) were used for collecting raw data in this case.
