lies  in  exploring the  potential of  deep  learning and  machine  learning 
algorithms  for  enhancing  groundwater-climate  interactions  under-
standing and investigating the climatic hotspots implications within the 
sub-basins of the GAB region.

up to two metres categorised into layers of 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 40 cm, 40 to 
100  cm, and 100  to 200 cm. In other words, rivers, lakes,  and water 
trapped below 2 m from the land are not covered by GLDAS-Noah (Bi 
et al., 2016). However, rivers and lakes were also not considered in our 
technique for estimating GWS due to the lack of notable surface water 
storage (<3%) change throughout the study region (Yan et al., 2017). In 
this study, SMS data was obtained using GLDAS observations from 2002 
to  2017.  GLDAS-derived  SMS  was  used  with  GRACE-derived  TWS  to 
quantify GWS variations across the region.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that SMS data was obtained using GLDAS observations from 2002 to 2017. GLDAS stands for Global Land Data Assimilation System, which integrates satellite and ground-based observational data. This suggests that remote sensing data might be one of the sources for collecting raw data. Additionally, the table summarizes various datasets with their spatial and temporal resolutions and sources, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI-3, 6 and 12, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, Niño 1+2, Niño 3.0, Niño 3.4, Niño 4, NTA, STA, and ETA. These datasets could potentially serve as inputs for the deep learning pipeline.
