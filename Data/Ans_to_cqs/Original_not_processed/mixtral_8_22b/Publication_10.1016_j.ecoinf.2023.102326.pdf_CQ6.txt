two examples for the LUTs “Main Street” and “Urban Forest”, depicting 
every step from the FCM, to thresholding, to the adjacency matrix and its 
respective network representation.

However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

In this work, we (i) describe all necessary steps of how CNs can be 
constructed from large-scale acoustic data and (ii) evaluate this process 
on approx. one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different 
sites  in  Bochum,  Germany.  Here,  the  foundation  for  constructing

All analyses were performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding 
packages.  A  list  of  packages  and  their  versions,  python  code  for  our 
analyses as well as a demo dataset with functions and documentation to 
apply FCM-based complex networks for any kind of power spectra from 
the urban AE is provided on GitHub (https://github.com/THaselhoff/Co

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning, common preprocessing steps may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data into a standard format or range, such as between 0 and 1, to ensure consistent input scales. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to a similar scale, preventing features with higher magnitudes from dominating the analysis. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, or errors within the dataset. These preprocessing techniques help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models by preparing the data for optimal use during training.
