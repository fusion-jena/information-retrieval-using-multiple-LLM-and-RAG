4.2. Lazy predict algorithm 

This  study  evaluated  input  data  using  the  automated  machine 
learning Lazy Predict algorithm in the Python library. The training and 
testing datasets are split into 70% training and 30% testing, respectively. 
In addition to the model execution times, important statistical indicators 
like  R2  and  RMSE  were  considered.  Moreover,  the  best  models  were 
selected using R2. For conductivity parameter, R2 values higher than 0.6 
were chosen among the first nine models. For BOD parameter models, R2 
values higher than 0.3 were chosen. Similarly, models with R2  values 
higher than 0.4 were chosen for DO and nitrate. Fig. 4‘s radar diagram 
shows each parameter’s chosen models.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

3.2.1. Lazy predict algorithm 

Lazy Predict, a popular Python library, automates machine learning 
and offers 40 ML models. This large collection allows rigorous testing to 
find  the  best  forecasting  models  for  our  dataset.  Since  data  diversity

3.2.2.8. LGBM  hyperparameter  tweaking. Table  2  shows  the  LGBM 
model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what specific steps were taken to deploy the model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
