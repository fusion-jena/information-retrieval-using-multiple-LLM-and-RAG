This whole procedure was solved using two R packages: topsis
(Yazdi, 2013) and stats (R Core Team, 2022). The optimization was
performed using the L-BFGS-B method (Byrd et al., 1995), a quasi-
Newton approach that can resolve functions with simple constraints.
In this case, there were only two constraints to ensure that the weights
were positive and not >1 (0 ≤ wj ≤ 1).

3.1. Dynamics of landscape fragmentation

The overall analysis of the landscape in the Valencian Community
revealed that the number of patches increased in the four groups into
which the land covers in the region were classified based on their
naturalness (Fig. 3a). This increase was statistically significant for the
first two groups and was particularly pronounced for the Completely
artificial, as shown in Table 4, which shows the results of the modified

discovery rate.

against

several

conflicting criteria.

These alternatives were evaluated using the Technique for Order of
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (Hwang and Yoon,
1981), which is a distance-based method that scores said alternatives not
only by their closeness to a positive ideal solution in the terms to be
evaluated (in this case habitat suitability) but also by their farness from a
negative ideal solution. For this purpose, the values xij of the i alterna-
tives (pixels of the study area) across the j indicators or criteria (vari-
ables in Table 2) must first be normalized. This was done using vector
ʹ
normalization, which yielded the normalized values x
ij. These values
were then multiplied by the weights wj of the indicators, representing
their relative importance in determining habitat suitability for Orycto-
lagus cuniculus.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the L-BFGS-B method, which is a quasi-Newton approach used for resolving functions with simple constraints. In this particular case, the constraints ensured that the weights were both positive and not greater than one (0 <= wj <= 1). The L-BFGS-B method was implemented through the use of two R packages: 'topois' and'stats'. However, it should be noted that the specifics regarding how the hyperparameters were selected for optimization, such as whether they were chosen via grid search or random search, are not explicitly mentioned within the given context.
