Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model such as GPUs or TPUs. The context primarily focuses on metadata fields relevant to ecological imaging projects, including various aspects of image acquisition, processing, and documentation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
