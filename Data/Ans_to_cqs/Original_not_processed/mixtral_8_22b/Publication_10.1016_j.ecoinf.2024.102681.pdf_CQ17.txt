to  the  size  and  number  of  convolution  kernels  and  hyperparameters, 
such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

improves  upon  the  limitations  of  traditional  methods  in  representing 
non-linear processes and also incorporates thresholds in drought indices 
to differentiate the levels of drought severity. A hybrid model is con-
structed  by  integrating  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  with 
Long Short-Term  Memory networks (LSTM) to effectively capture the 
intricate process of drought propagation (Ghimire et al., 2021; Khorram 
and Jehbez, 2023). CNNs are effective at modeling the linear and non- 
linear relationships between influencing factors and drought propaga-
tion time and the interactions among influencing factors. Meanwhile, 
LSTMs  are  used  to  learn  the  time  lags  in  the  responses  of  drought 
propagation time to various influencing factors.(Ghimire et al., 2021; 
Qu  et  al.,  2021).  The  hybrid  model,  constructed  by  integrating  both 
elements, can handle the complex process of drought propagation. This

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps prevent overfitting. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. These penalties discourage large weights and help reduce overfitting. Other techniques such as early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization can also be employed to mitigate overfitting.
