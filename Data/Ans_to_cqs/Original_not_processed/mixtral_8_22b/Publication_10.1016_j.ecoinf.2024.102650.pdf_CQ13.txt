Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

LDA—  proposed  by  Blei  et  al.  (2003)—is  a  topic  model  for  text 
generation based on natural language processing. The basic idea is that 
any text (in this study, microblog tweets) is composed of multiple topics 
with a polynomial distribution and each topic is composed of multiple 
words  with  a  polynomial  distribution.  By  analyzing  the  polynomial 
distribution of words for each topic, similar topics are aggregated into a 
topic category, and topic classification of the text is achieved (Tautorat 
et al., 2023). The advantage of LDA is its unsupervised nature, which 
means that the input corpus does not require labeled data, making it an 
ideal technique for topic modeling when labeled topics are not available 
and the quantity of input texts is large (Palanichamy et al., 2021; Sun 
and Yin, 2017).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model was used, which is known to learn prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data. This suggests that the model may have been trained using techniques like transfer learning or fine-tuning, but without further details, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used.
