In  the  subsequent  sections,  we  assess  model  performance  in  the 
context of model complexity and explainability, crop specific training 
against  generalized  training,  and  contrast  remote  sensing  and  meteo-
rological measurements to provide predictive performance for several 
potential use cases. 

3.1. Model complexity 

The management of model complexity is an important consideration 
in  data-driven  model  development (Jolliffe,  1986; Wang  et  al.,  2017; 
Yates  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  study  we  define  model  complexity  as  the 
number of variables included in the predictor set. Proper selection of 
variables, i.e. feature selection, can minimize training costs, measure-
ment  requirements,  and  decrease  the  likelihood  of  overfitting  (Banks 
and Fienberg, 2003; Cawley and Talbot, 2010).

2.5. Machine learning methods

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. The given context mentions the use of random forest models, which belong to the category of machine learning algorithms rather than deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, it cannot be determined if a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer was employed in the pipeline.
