For model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, with 
the  remaining  20%  (the  evaluation  set)  used  to  assess  model  perfor-
mance. This procedure was necessary for thoroughly assessing the pre-
cision of our models. To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we used 
two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS) (Allouche et al., 
2006; Wani et al., 2022). To  ensure the robustness of our results, we 
applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create 
separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. When 
selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those 
with a TSS score of ≥0.7.

Jim´enez et al., 2022). To further refine our projections, we tested two 
types of cutouts; one is called the general extent (GE), encompassing the 
total sum of the natural distribution areas of the four species, and the 
other is referred to as the specific extent (SE), restricted to the individual 
distribution  of  each  species.  To  crop  the  bioclimatic  layers,  we  used

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for binary classification based on the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) as a metric for evaluating its performance. ROC curves are typically used to visualize the performance of binary classifiers. Additionally, the True Skill Statistics (TSS) metric is also mentioned, which is another common measure used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model is being used for binary classification purposes.
