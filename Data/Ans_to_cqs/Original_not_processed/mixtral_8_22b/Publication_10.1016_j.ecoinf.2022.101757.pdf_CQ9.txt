ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

tion deep learning-based methods (Ulku and Akagündüz, 2022). Such 
semantic  segmentation  or  pixel-wise  classification  was  used  to  locate 
and  delineate  artificial  and  natural  objects  in  photos  it  a  study  by 
Aghanaki, T. (Taghanaki et al., 2021). This operation was enabled by the 
availability of open image datasets which have pushed the evolution of

the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the weights for DeeplabV3+ were obtained from an already trained implementation using the COCO dataset, but there is no mention of where this dataset can be accessed. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
