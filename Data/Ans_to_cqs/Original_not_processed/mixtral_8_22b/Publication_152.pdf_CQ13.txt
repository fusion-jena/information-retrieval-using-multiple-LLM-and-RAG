%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was tested with multiple configurations and proved efficient for improving results quickly. Additionally, Adam optimization method is referenced in one of the cited papers [27], but there is no direct confirmation if this method was utilized in the current work. Therefore, without further details from the original source, we cannot definitively determine which hyperparameters were used in their deep learning model.
