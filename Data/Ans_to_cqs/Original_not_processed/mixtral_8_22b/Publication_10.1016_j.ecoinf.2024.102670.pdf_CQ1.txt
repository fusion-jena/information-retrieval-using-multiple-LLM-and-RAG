An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, one example mentioned is utilizing crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotations, which was demonstrated by Sharma et al. (2017). This approach involves non-expert users for gathering ground truth data, specifically for karyotyping images of chromosomes. Additionally, the use of public datasets like those referenced in Table 7 could also serve as sources of raw data for deep learning models. These datasets may have been collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or other forms of data collection.
