The MLP is configured with a filter size of 2 and is used 
with Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as 
the optimiser. A dropout value of 50% has been used in the 
first  three  layers  to  improve  generalisation  and  reduce 
overfitting. The first three layers are composed of 256 nodes 
while the final layer is equal to the number of classes in our 
dataset. The model summary is shown in figure 5.

paper to train the model. 

The  performance  of  the  trained  model  is  measured  using 
Sensitivity,  Specificity,  Precision  and  Accuracy.  The 
Sensitivity  describes 
the 
Specificity describes the true negative rate. Precision is used 
to show the number of correctly classified species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies.

The  trained  model  is  hosted  using  TensorFlow  2.2  and 
served  through  a  public  facing  website  developed  by  the 
authors 2 .  CUDA  11  and  cuDNN  7.6.5  enables  the  GPU 
accelerated learning aspect of the pipeline. A Samsung S10 is 
used  to  record  garden  birds  and  automatically  upload  the 
acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP) for classification. Figure 6 shows the end-
to-end inferencing pipeline starting with the sensor and ending 
with the public facing conservationAI site as shown in Figure 
7.  Due  to  the  use  of  standard  protocols,  the  system  can 
interface  with  a  variety  of  sensors  for  real-time  inference. 
Where in field communication is unavailable, audio files can 
be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing.

The  acquired  audio  files  are  transmitted  over  4G  using 
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. 
Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature extractor 
function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features 
for the classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged 
to the site for review.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this section the classification results are presented using 
the  evaluation  metrics  outlined  previously.  The  deployment 
and inferencing of the trained model in test environment are 
also presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the end-to-end 
pipeline.

Helpful Answer:

The deep learning pipeline uses Adam as the optimizer. Additionally, a dropout value of 50% has been employed in the first three layers to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. These techniques contribute to improving the overall performance and accuracy of the model.
