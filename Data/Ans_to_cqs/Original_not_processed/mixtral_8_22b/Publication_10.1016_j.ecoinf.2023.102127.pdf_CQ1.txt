Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss Species Distribution Models (SDMs) which are mentioned as being data-driven methods. This implies that SDMs rely on large amounts of data for their functioning.

Typically, in ecology and environmental studies, raw data can be collected through various means including field surveys, remote sensing technologies like satellite imagery or drones, sensor networks, and publicly available datasets. Field surveys involve direct observation and recording of species occurrences, abundance, and other relevant variables. Remote sensing technologies provide spatial data over large areas, often useful for understanding habitat characteristics. Sensor networks can continuously monitor environmental conditions. Publicly available datasets from repositories or open databases can also contribute significantly to the pool of raw data.

However, the context emphasizes the importance of good availability and quality of data at adequate scales for SDMs. This suggests that regardless of the method used for data collection, ensuring high data quality and relevance is crucial for accurate modeling.
