To address the problem of unbalanced training data, scholars have 
explored  various  sampling  techniques,  including  major  category

undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping,

Helpful Answer:

The text discusses several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. One common issue is dealing with unbalanced training data, which can increase training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena. To address this, scholars have explored various sampling techniques such as major category undersampling (Freeman et al., 2012), minor category oversampling (Rayhan et al., 2017), and combinations of oversampling and undersampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). Additionally, Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of land use/land cover (LULC) mapping in Madagascar, a region characterized by highly heterogeneous landscapes.

Image presegmentation is another technique mentioned in the text, which retains the benefits of object-based classification while eliminating time-consuming parameter adjustments required by traditional segmentation methods. The proposed method is deployed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, indicating its potential application to other regions or different study years.

Moreover, the text suggests that larger sample sizes can improve classification accuracy, especially when the initial sample size is small. Continuous optimization of sample and vegetation index feature datasets is recommended for future studies. Lastly, incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) deep-learning algorithms into the study of LULC mapping in arid zones is suggested for future research.

In summary, some techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, image presegmentation, and using larger sample sizes. Additionally, deploying models on platforms like GEE allows for easy application to other regions or different study years. Future research could focus on continuous optimization of sample and vegetation index feature datasets and incorporating CNN and DNN deep-learning algorithms into LULC mapping studies.
