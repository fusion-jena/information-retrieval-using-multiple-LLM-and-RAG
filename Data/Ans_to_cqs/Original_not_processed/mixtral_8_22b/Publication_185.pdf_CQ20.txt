units in the third fully connected layer (fc3) was changed according to the number of classes of 
training data. We set the batch size to 69 and momentum to 0.9 and applied L2 weight decay with 
penalty multiplier set to 5 × 10-4, dropout ratio set to 0.5, CPU mode

Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a
