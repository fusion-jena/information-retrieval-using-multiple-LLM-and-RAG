3. Methodology 

3.1. Image processing 

GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform. Considerable quanti-
ties of geospatial data are publicly available on GEE, including a mul-
tipetabyte  catalog  of  satellite  imagery,  such  as  Landsat  imagery. 
Consequently, GEE facilitates rapid data access and parallel processing 
for analysis (Gorelick et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2018). The present 
study  utilized  the  GEE  platform  to  retrieve  atmospherically  corrected 
United  States  Geological  Survey  Landsat  Surface  reflectance  products

5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of existing images, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
