Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their respective deep learning models. However, some common practices used in machine learning to improve model generalization include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques such as regularization and dropout.

In the paper by Navares and Aznarte (2020), they use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting air quality. While they mention using a large dataset from multiple sources, there is no explicit information regarding the specific steps taken to ensure the generalizability of their model.

Similarly, Neckel et al. (2023) discuss air pollution in Budapest but do not explicitly state any methods employed to enhance the generalizability of their approach. Ogen (2020) investigates the relationship between nitrogen dioxide levels and COVID-19 fatalities without providing insights into improving the model's applicability across different regions or scenarios.

While Pandey (2020) focuses on fly ash deposits as a potential sink for carbon sequestration, this study does not involve developing a deep learning model. Lastly, Pope et al.'s work examines the impact of fine particles on mortality rates, but it also lacks information on ensuring the generalizability of their methodology.

Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively determine which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models discussed in these studies.
