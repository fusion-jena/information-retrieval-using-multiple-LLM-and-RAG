1.  INTRODUCTION

5.  SUMMARY

The  automated  classification  of  migrating  birds'  ftight  calls  has 
the  potential  to  yield  new  biologieal  insights  and  conservation  ap 
plications  for  birds  that  vocalize  during  migration.  In  this  paper 
we  explored  two  state-of-the-art classification  techniques  for large 
vocabulary  bird  species  classification  from  flight  calls:  a  "shallow 
learning" unsupervised dietionary learning  method and  a deep con 
volutional  neural  network  combined  with  data  augmentation.  The 
models  were evaluated on a dataset of 5428  ftight  calls from 43  dif 
ferent  species, and  were  compared  against  a  baseline  model  based 
on  MFCCs.  We  showed  that  the  two  models  perform  comparably, 
yielding  a  mean  classification  accuracy  of 0.94  and  significantly 
outperforming  the  MFCC  baseline  (0.85).  We  also  compared  the 
performance of the CNN model  with  and  without augmentation and

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training. However, common practices in machine learning include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, and generating saliency maps to understand which parts of the input data contribute most to the predictions made by the model. These steps can help evaluate the performance of the trained models and provide insights into their decision-making process. It should be noted that these postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific application and requirements of the project.
