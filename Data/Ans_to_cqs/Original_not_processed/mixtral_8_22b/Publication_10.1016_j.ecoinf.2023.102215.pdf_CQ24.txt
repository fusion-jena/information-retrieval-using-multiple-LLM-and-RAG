networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

2.3. Model training 

Our study can be categorized as a binary classification. We supervise 
TrunkNet’s training with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, 
which  is  a  commonly  employed  loss  function  in  supervised  deep 
learning (Zhao et al., 2019b). The BCE loss function measures the dif-
ference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Mini-
mizing this difference indicates a better training effect. Specifically, the 
BCE loss function in use is expressed with 

L BCE = (cid:0)

where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of 
the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre  is the final pre-
dicted saliency map.

of dilated convolution with various dilated rates to enlarge the receptive 
field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

After  annotating  and  examining  the  images,  we  divided  them 
randomly into a training set, and a testing set using a ratio of 65% to 
35%  respectively.  Consequently,  our  dataset  was  divided  into  1691 
images for training and 878 images for testing. 

2.1.3. Dataset properties 

Not  only  is  the  proposed  ST-D  large  in  scale  and  high-quality  in 

annotation, but also it features good diversity which is listed below. 

Tree trunk size. To study the size of all salient tree trunks per pic-
ture,  we  calculated  the  percentage  of  pixels  in  each  picture  that  are 
occupied by salient tree trunks. In our dataset, the sizes of salient objects 
range from 0.39% to 97.8%, with an average of 34.53%. As shown in 
Fig. 3(a), our ST-D has more diverse tree trunk sizes in its images and 
balances the large and small objects, which is beneficial to train the SOD 
models and evaluate their generalization performance.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on how the authors handled randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on common practices in machine learning research, there are several ways to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. One approach is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes like data shuffling or weight initialization. This ensures consistency across experiments and allows for reproducibility. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different random seeds and averaging results to reduce variance caused by randomness. Lastly, some researchers may choose to report results over multiple runs instead of a single run to account for variability due to randomness.
