Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some of the research papers cited do mention specific datasets or sources used in their studies. For instance, You et al. (2021) discuss the creation of 10-meter crop type maps in Northeast China between 2017-2019, but they do not explicitly state where this dataset can be accessed. Similarly, other authors such as Yin et al. (2020) and Yue et al. (2019) describe using various types of satellite imagery and vegetation indices for their respective analyses without providing links to these datasets. Therefore, it would be best to refer directly to each individual study for more detailed information regarding the data repositories used in their research.
