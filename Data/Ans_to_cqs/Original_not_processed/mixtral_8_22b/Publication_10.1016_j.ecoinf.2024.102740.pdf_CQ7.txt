System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad,

1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not provide explicit details regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that common practices have been followed. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. In the given context, the paper by Probst et al. discusses hyperparameters and tuning strategies for Random Forest models but does not explicitly mention how they split their data. Similarly, other papers use various machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) without specifying the exact splitting methodology. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training in these studies.
