Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository or platform where the deep learning pipeline data is available in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
