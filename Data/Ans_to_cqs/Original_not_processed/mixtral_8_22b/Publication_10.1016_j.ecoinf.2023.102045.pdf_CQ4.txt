different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

the workflow include a separate import of the image and the application of a set of colour ramp palettes and (ii) 
albeit being well  documented, there  are many steps to be done  before plotting an image with  a colour blind 
friendly ramp palette. The function described in this paper, on the contrary, allows to (i) automatically call the 
image inside the function without any initial import step and (ii) explicitly refer to the colour blind deficiency 
type being experienced, to further automatically apply the proper colour ramp palette.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding the data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have developed a method for creating colorblind-friendly images using the programming language R. While this approach could potentially be integrated into a larger machine learning pipeline, the text does not discuss its use within a deep learning framework or mention any specific data augmentation techniques employed. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what data augmentation techniques were used in this case, we can describe some commonly used methods in similar applications.
