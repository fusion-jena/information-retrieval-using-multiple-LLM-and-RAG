2.3. Evaluation Method

To test the performance of proposed model, the sample is divided into four situations
based on the actual classiﬁcation and the ESK predicted classiﬁcation. In Table 2, four
situations are illustrated with a confusion matrix. True positive (TP) is the number of
ingroups that are correctly classiﬁed as ingroups. True negative (TN) is the number of
outgroups that are correctly classiﬁed as outgroups. False positive (FP) is the number of
outgroups that are wrongly classiﬁed as ingroups. False negative (FN) is the number of
ingroups that are wrongly classiﬁed as outgroups.

With confusion matrix, the classiﬁcation performance of all experiments is measured
by three criterions: accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Those evaluation equations are formu-
lated as follows:

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

Recall =

Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

In addition, Table 4 illustrates the detailed data corresponding to Figure 5. The
accuracy, recall, and F1-Score on Mugilidae increased by approximately 4.98%, 5.24%, and
2.78%, respectively. Similarly, under the same conditions, the performance measures also
increased in other two datasets. Those results indicate that add Elastic Net can improve
the classiﬁcation performance of the ESK.

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the sample into four situations based on the actual classification and the ESK predicted classification. These situations are represented in a confusion matrix, which includes true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). Using this matrix, the classification performance of all experiments is measured by three criteria: accuracy, recall, and F1-score. These evaluation equations are formulated as follows:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and compare it with other methods. Additionally, Elastic Net was employed to address the issue of overfitting in small datasets and enhance the generalization capability of the ESK model. This approach improved the performance of the proposed model, as demonstrated by the increase in accuracy, recall, and F1-score on various datasets.
