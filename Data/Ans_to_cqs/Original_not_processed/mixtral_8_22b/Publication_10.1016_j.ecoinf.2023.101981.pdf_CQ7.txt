Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Statistical analyses

different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2â€“70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

2.3. Acoustic data analyses 

We  used  Kaleidoscope  Pro  5.3.9  (Wildlife  Acoustics)  to  scan  the 
acoustic dataset, which is an efficient automated software for acoustic 
analyses. The Kaleidoscope output includes all the regions of interest (i. 
e., candidate sounds, ROIs hereafter) that meet the desired signal pa-
rameters. The five signal parameters required to run acoustic analyses 
are  the  following:  maximum  intersyllable  gap  (ms),  minimum  and 
maximum  detection  lengths  (s),  and  minimum  and  maximum  fre-
quencies  (Hz).  The  maximum  intersyllable  gap  defines  the  maximum 
allowable  time  between  two  vocalizations  to  be  considered  a  unique 
vocalization (i.e., vocalizations separated by more space than the one

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the data randomly, stratified sampling based on class distribution, or using temporal or spatial splits depending on the nature of the data. It is important to ensure that the splits maintain similar distributions of classes or features to avoid bias during training and evaluation.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the authors might have followed standard practices for splitting the data, but without explicit mention, the exact method remains unknown.
