of a plethora of runs with different number of trees (Probst et al., 2019). 
For  the  best  split  selection  measurement,  the  Gini  Index  was  used 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  number  of  variables  used  for  each  node  (mtry) 
were  automatically  selected  by  using  repeated  cross  validations  per-
formed  with  10  folds  and  10  repetitions  for  the  seagrass  meadow 
models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow 
models. The available validation dataset was used to create a confusion 
matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, metrics 
as  overall  (O.A.),  producer  (P.A.)  and  user  (U.A.)  accuracy  for  each 
classified class were calculated (Congalton, 1991). O.A. represents the 
proportion  of  correctly  classified  validation  samples  (found along  the 
diagonal in the error matrix) to the total number of validation samples, 
irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately clas-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various types of seagrass meadows and species. This helped in capturing the variability present in real-world scenarios and improved the robustness of the model. Secondly, cross-validation was employed to evaluate the performance of the model. Specifically, repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions were performed for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. Cross-validation is a powerful technique that helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned; however, it can be assumed that the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets in such a way that each set contained a representative sample of all classes. This ensures that the model learns from a balanced distribution of classes and improves its ability to generalize to new data. Overall, these measures contribute to enhancing the reliability and applicability of the deep learning model in practical settings.
