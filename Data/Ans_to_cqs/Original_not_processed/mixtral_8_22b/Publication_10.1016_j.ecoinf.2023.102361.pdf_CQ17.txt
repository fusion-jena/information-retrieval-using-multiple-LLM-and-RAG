Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

VGG16 and VGG19 are classical architectures that are well known 
for  simplicity  and  uniformity.  These  models  are  suitable  for  smaller 
datasets and can provide better accuracy by fine-tuning the pre-trained 
network (Sukegawa et al., 2020). The models have several drawbacks, 
such  as  vanishing  gradient  problems  and  loss  of  fine-grained  spatial 
information (Pan et al., 2020). On the other hand, ResNet-50 contains 
residual  connections,  which  can  overcome  the  vanishing  gradient 
problem and enable training very deep networks. The model performs 
well on both large and small datasets (Al-Masni et al., 2020).

2.6.4. Model training with selected patches 

We trained the same deep learning models as mentioned in Section 
2.5. For training, we resized all the patches of images to a resolution of 
256 × 256 pixels. Although after dividing the image into patches, there 
were images with lower resolution, i.e., 64 × 64 and 128 × 128 pixels, 
they were converted into a uniform size. 

2.6.5. Evaluation of the models 

An image was divided into patches first to predict its class label. Then 
the important patches were selected using the approach mentioned in 
Section 2.6.3. After that, the model predicted the class label for each 
patch. The weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the 
class label of the image from the predicted labels. 

2.7. Experimental setup

diction  of  the  deep  learning  model.  This  dataset  was  taken  to  verify 
whether our proposed approach can handle that issue. The dataset was 
shared  by  Jiang  et  al.  (2020)  through  the  Github  repository:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use these techniques to improve generalization and avoid overfitting. In the absence of explicit information about regularization methods used in this study, one could assume that standard practices like dropout or L2 regularization might have been employed but cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided context.
