We simplified the network architecture and hierarchical dependency 
loss  proposed  by  Gao  (2020)  and  rewrote  the  code  from  Ugenteraan 
(2020), which will be explained in the following sections. 

3.1. A multitask CNN for hierarchical classification 

Our proposed network architecture is shown in Fig. 2. The first part 
of the architecture is a CNN such, as ResNet (He et al., 2016) or Effi-
cientNet (Tan and Le, 2019). It is given an input image X transformed by 
the network NCNN(θCNN), where θCNN  means the trainable parameters of 
the CNN network. The network output is viewed as a root representation 
R0, 

R0 = NCNN (X, θCNN )

(1) 

For each level l we add two FC layers and an activation function to 
perform a non-linear transformation of the input R0  to the level output 
Rl. 

Rl = (Wl2*σrelu(Wl1*R0 + bl1)) + bl2)

(2)

Eq. (4) denotes the predicted class in level l as the maximum output 
value from the network at the level. An input image is also classified as 
‘unsure’ when the predicted class is not correct according to the higher 
rank in the taxonomic hierarchy as defined in Eq. (7).

3.3. Training, augmentation and optimizers 

The training on the datasets was  performed using data augmenta-
tion, including image scaling, horizontal and vertical flip, perspective 
distortion and adding color jitter for brightness, contrast and saturation. 
Data augmentation mitigates overfitting by increasing the diversity of 
the training data. We selected a batch size of 20 for training our models 
since it is faster to update, and results in less noise, than smaller batch 
sizes. The accuracy of the models on the training and validation datasets 
was computed after each epoch.

monitoring  globally  and  for  efficient  pest  management  (Preti  et  al., 
2021). Deep-learning methods are increasingly used for classification in 
many fields and are emerging in entomology (Høye et al., 2021). Such 
methods require large training datasets to provide robust predictions, 
which has so far been a limiting factor in entomological applications. 
Specifically,  insects  are  very  diverse  and  their  abundance  is  highly 
variable,  which  often  results  in  unbalanced  datasets  with  numerous 
classes  nested  inside  each  other  in  a  taxonomic  hierarchy.  As  these 
methods mature and are implemented in monitoring programs, the de-
mand for greater taxonomic resolution of classifications will increase. So 
far, the level of fine-grained classification is still rather limited, not least 
because classification models rely on training data where images have 
species labels assigned to them.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model described in this study is for hierarchical classification of insect species based on images. This involves identifying the order, family, and species of insects within a taxonomic hierarchy. The authors propose a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses ResNet or EfficientNet as its base model. The network takes an input image and transforms it through the CNN, producing a root representation. For each level in the taxonomy, two fully connected (FC) layers and an activation function are added to perform a non-linear transformation of the input to the level output. The goal is to accurately predict the classes at each level of the taxonomy while minimizing uncertainty. Data augmentation techniques were employed during training to improve the model's ability to generalize and avoid overfitting.
