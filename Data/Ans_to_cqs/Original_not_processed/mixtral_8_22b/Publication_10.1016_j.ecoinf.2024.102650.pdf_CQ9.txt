Previous studies mainly focused on the spatial location of the sites, 
while neglecting the probability of site pollution (Wang et al., 2022; Wei 
et al., 2022). For example, Jia et al. (2019) used machine learning to 
identify  potentially  contaminated  sites  based  on  unstructured text  in-
formation  such  as  company  names  and  latitude  and  longitude  infor-
mation from Google’s interest points in the Yangtze River Delta region. 
Tang et al. (2020) obtained 5189 tailings ponds and their spatial dis-
tribution  characteristics  in  China  based  on  multiple  sources  of  infor-
mation  such  as  government  publications,  scientific  literature,  online 
news, and field investigations. However, few studies have analyzed the 
probability of site pollution. In this study, we obtained the emotions and 
spatial locations of public opinions on contaminated sites. Our results 
indicated that all municipal administrative regions in the study area had

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could possibly be found within one of the cited papers or resources, but without further investigation, I am unable to provide a definitive answer.
