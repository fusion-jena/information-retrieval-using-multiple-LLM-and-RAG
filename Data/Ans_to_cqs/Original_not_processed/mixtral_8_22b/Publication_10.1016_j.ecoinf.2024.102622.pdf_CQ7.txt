The extraction of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for estimating 
the  crop  chlorophyll  content  in  the  field  scale.  Zhang  et  al.  (2020) 
pointed out that the end of July in Northeast China is the peak growth 
period of different crops, during which the physiological parameters of 
crops are at their peak (e.g., greenness and water content), which is the 
best  time  window  for  crop  classification.  In  addition,  classification 
methods, this study verifies the optimality of random forest classifica-
tion  by  comparing  multiple  mainstream  machine  learning  methods 
(including random forest classification, support vector machine classi-
fication, decision tree classification) (You et al., 2021). Therefore, for 
the Sentinel-2 images from 21 July 2022, we selected the random forest 
classification  method  to  extract  the  rice-growing  area  of  Qian  Gorlos 
County with a classification accuracy of over 90% (Fig. 1). Because rice

rice canopy coverage with the largest error in C3 and the smallest error 
in C2 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that RF is a machine learning model 
that is suitable for LCC estimation, but the estimation accuracy of the C1 
and  C3  regions  still  require  to  be  improved.  The  study  area  can  be 
divided according to crop coverage, and the overall estimation accuracy 
of the study area can be improved by searching for suitable VIs that are 
sensitive to LCC under different coverage conditions.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the dataset was divided into two parts: a training set and a validation set. However, there is no explicit mention of how the data was split or what specific criteria were used to divide the data. Typically, when using supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, the dataset is often randomly shuffled and then split into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance after each epoch. Finally, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It seems that in this case, only a training set and a validation set were mentioned, without any reference to a testing set. Nonetheless, the division of datasets into these subsets is crucial for evaluating the generalization ability of the model and preventing overfitting.
