The number of images you send to the model in each iteration. 
Model parameters are updated after each batch during training. 
How many times you pass the full image dataset through the model. 
The error metric that you wish to minimize. 
e.g. Cross entropy loss for multi-class classification. 
A small number (0, 1] that determines the amount to alter parameters 
during training with respect to the loss. 
Also known as the step size.

e.g. the Adam optimizer sets the learning rate adaptively for faster and 
more efficient training.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what the postprocessing steps are after the model training. However, we can infer from the table of required steps in the machine learning workflows (Table 3), which includes preprocessing, training, validation, testing, and evaluation, that there might be some form of postprocessing involved.

Preprocessing involves preparing the data before feeding it into the model, such as normalization, augmentation, and splitting the data into training and test sets. Training involves fitting the model to the training data using various algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Validation involves evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to prevent overfitting. Testing involves assessing the model's ability to generalize to new data. Evaluation involves measuring the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc.

From this information, we can deduce that postprocessing could involve generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, visualizing results, interpreting outputs, fine-tuning models, deploying models, monitoring performance, updating models, etc. However, without explicit mention of these steps in the given context, we cannot confirm their involvement in the postprocessing stage.
