Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

The observed increasing trend in both accuracy and F1-score for the 
WT-HMM across different dataset sizes aligns with findings in similar 
studies.  Previous  research  in  bioacoustics  has  highlighted  the  impor-
tance of dataset size in training robust models for cetacean vocalization 
classification  (Lu  et  al.,  2021;  Ogundile  et  al.,  2020;  Ogundile  et  al., 
2021; Usman et al., 2020). Larger datasets provide models with more 
diverse examples, aiding in the generalization of learned features and 
patterns. The consistent improvement in accuracy and F1-score for both 
recording periods indicates that the WT-HMM is not only effective for 
smaller datasets but also scales well as the dataset size increases. This 
scalability  is  a  crucial  characteristic,  especially  in  bioacoustic  moni-
toring where datasets can vary significantly in size (Xie et al., 2020).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of varying dataset sizes in the context of WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform - Hidden Markov Model) for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls. It mentions that larger datasets provide models with more diverse examples, which aid in the generalization of learned features and patterns. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training. Additionally, it highlights the scalability of the WT-HMM, indicating its effectiveness for smaller datasets and its ability to scale well as the dataset size increases. Therefore, while the exact datasets used are not specified, the context implies the use of varying dataset sizes related to bioacoustic monitoring, specifically for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls.
