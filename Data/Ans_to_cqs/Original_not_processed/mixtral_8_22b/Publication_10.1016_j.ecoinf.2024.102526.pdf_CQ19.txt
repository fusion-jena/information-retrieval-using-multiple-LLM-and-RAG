Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context focuses on various aspects related to capturing images, metadata associated with those images, and documentation references. It includes details like image orientation, illumination, scale reference, practical constraints, acquisition settings, pixel per millimeter, area square meter, curation protocol, QAQC, ancillary data captured, use of bait, mapping techniques, sampling protocol, sunlight or artificial lighting, UTC time format, decimal degree coordinates, camera EXIF data, image pixel resolution, field of view, taxonomic coverage, organism quantity types, geographical descriptions, temporal coverage, planned quantifications, derived metrics, spatial extents, temporal extents, image intervals, location of specimens, number of cameras, and light spectra. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks used for building models.
