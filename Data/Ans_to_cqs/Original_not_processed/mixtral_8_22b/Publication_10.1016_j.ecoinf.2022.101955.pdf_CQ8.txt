2.3.2.3. ANN: artificial neural networks classification. In classifying with 
the MLP ANN model, we used the package “nnet”, which provides pos-
sibilities for adjusting weighted decay and size, thereby countering the 
effects of model overfitting. We used an MLP ANN architecture with 1 
hidden layer established as a default setting within the “nnet” package, 
and with 6 neurons defined for our model inputs. The number of neurons 
in the input layer was equal to the number of used bands (6), and the 
output  layer  had  8  neurons  (representing  8  LULC  classes).  A  back 
propagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of 
the model. Size and decay were used to define the primary model tuning 
parameters, and the control () function was used to control for model 
runs. As with the kNN approach, we defined the LULC classes of the test 
datasets  as  target  variables  and  the  band  reflectance  values  as  pre-

solving  (Kubat,  1999;  Yang,  2009).  In  LULC  classification,  the  Multi- 
Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN has been used most often (Silva 
et al., 2020). MLP carries out backpropagation of training samples to 
accurately classify LULC. The RF was developed as an ensemble of ML 
models that use bootstrap techniques to build many single decision tree 
models (Breiman, 2001; Mellor et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 
2012). The RF model uses subsets of predictor variables (e.g. Landsat 
bands) to split observation datasets into subsets of homogenous samples 
to build each decision tree (Mellor et al., 2013).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various research papers related to remote sensing, geographical mapping, and machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and random forests. However, it does not mention anything about the availability or location of the code repository for these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on this context alone.
