This study aims to develop an affordable and continuous method for monitoring water quality in arid, remote 
areas with high erosion rates. It presents a hypothesis that establishes a link between the concentration of Total 
Suspended Matter (TSM) and wind speed, emphasizing its ecological importance in lakes with dry conditions and 
high  erosion  rates.  Building  upon  this  hypothesis,  the  study  introduces  Wind2TSM-Net,  a  machine  learning 
model that effectively bridges between different regression and neural network algorithms. This model connects 
on-site  wind  speed  measurements  with  TSM  data  obtained  through  a  physically  remote  sensing  approach.  It 
accurately predicts TSM concentration values, overcoming challenges such as cloud interference and reducing 
reliance on satellite imagery. The model was applied to Iran’s Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs) as a case study in
