Accuracy metrics for models with average and entropy features across window sizes  

Table A.6 
Accuracies and classification results into iceplant (positive class P) and other vegetation (negative class N) from models using spectral, NDVI, and date features together 
with average and entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window, calculated across multiple window sizes. Accuracies are given in percentages.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation dataset during training. When the validation loss or error rate stops improving significantly over several epochs, it can be considered a sign that the model has converged and further training may lead to overfitting. This phenomenon is often referred to as a 'validation loss plateau.' Other possible criteria could involve setting a predefined number of epochs or iterations, or stopping when the maximum allowed time for training has been reached.
