2.2. Data sources and pre-processing 

We acquired GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources 
Satellite Data and Application (http://www.cresda.com/CN/) (Table 1). 
The  GF-6  remote  sensing  data  were  preprocessed,  mainly  including 
radiometric  calibration,  atmospheric  correction,  geometric  correction 
and image cropping.

by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. While the exact steps may vary depending on the dataset and problem at hand, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This is often done to prevent any one feature from dominating the others during training.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the scale of the input features. However, instead of rescaling them to a fixed range, scaling aims to bring all features to a similar magnitude. This can help improve convergence speed during training.
3. Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or redundant information from the dataset. This could include removing missing values, outliers, or duplicates. It can also involve encoding categorical variables into numerical form if necessary.
4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. This could include taking ratios, differences, or other mathematical operations on the original features.
5. Augmentation: This involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to the existing samples. This can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.
