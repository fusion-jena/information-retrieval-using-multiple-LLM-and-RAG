The input layer receives two-dimensional data of size [observation 
time (s) × 4, 1]. As mentioned (section 2.4.3), the output vector sizes of 
the three LSTM layers were set to 32, 32, and 16, respectively, and a 
dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. The number of stacked 
LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model 
hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve 
optimal performance. 

We have summarized the components of the proposed system into an 
overall  learning  and  testing  procedure  of  the  monitoring  system  in 
Fig. 6. During the learning stage, features are extracted from the training 
data set using the previously introduced feature extraction algorithm, 
and the  model is  trained. After the training is  completed, the trained 
model  is  used  to  predict  water  conditions  and  analyze  performance 
using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage.

2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

curacy  below  70%  in  all  experiments,  and  it  does  not  significantly 
benefit from increasing observation time in terms of classification per-
formance. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7(a, b), the SD values of the 
accuracy of our LSTM model are much smaller than those of the HMM.

2.4.5. Performance metrics 

To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we used four 
performance metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. The

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves extracting features from the training dataset using a feature extraction algorithm. Once the features are extracted, they are used to train the model. After the training phase, the trained model is then utilized to predict water conditions and assess its performance using a separate test dataset that wasn't involved in the training stage. This approach allows for evaluating the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying different water conditions. Additionally, the authors mention employing several performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score to further gauge the model's efficiency.
