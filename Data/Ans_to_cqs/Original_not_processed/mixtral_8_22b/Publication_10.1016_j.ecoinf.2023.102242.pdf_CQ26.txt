refine  the  subsequent  classification  process.  Future  research  should 
focus on this issue to yield more reliable results.

4.4. Classification method

The  processing  of  high-resolution  remote  sensing  data,  which  en-
compasses  a  plethora  of  feature  information  (Girshick  et  al.,  2014), 
demands  significant  time  and  costs.  This  presents  considerable  chal-
lenges for many researchers (Modzelewska et al., 2020). Prior to clas-
sification, samples require training. The representativeness and quantity 
of  these  training  samples  significantly  influence  the  accuracy  of  the 
classification  models.  Platinum  (Ting,  2016)  demonstrated  that  when 
the training samples are not sufficiently typical, other categories can be 
easily misclassified into the sampleâ€™s category. If the number of training 
samples is insufficient, network training may not meet the requirements. 
Conversely, an excessive number of training samples can lead to data 
redundancy, reducing the efficiency of model training (Shi, 2018). To 
address  this  issue,  this  study  employed  feature  optimization  tools  to

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on addressing challenges related to the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, including issues with data redundancy and the impact of training sample size on classification accuracy. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this particular study.
