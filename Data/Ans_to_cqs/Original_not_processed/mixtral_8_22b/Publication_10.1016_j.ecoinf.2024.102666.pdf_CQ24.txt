options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient. 

5.2. The impact of time and spatial factors on atmospheric correction

artificial neural networks (ANN) (Men et al., 2022). The efficacy of these 
algorithms exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic envi-
ronments. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of 
Spectral  Hypercubes  (FLAASH)  model,  originally  developed  for  land 
pixels,  has  proven  effective  in  AC  for  aquatic  environments  utilizing 
Sentinel-2  and  SPOT-6  imagery  (Rotta  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2023a, 
2023b, 2023c, 2023d). Additionally, the FLAASH algorithm mitigates 
the  spatial  proximity  effect  by  employing  an  internal  pixel  averaging 
technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC (Wang et al., 
2021).  In  investigations  of  lacustrine  environments  using  Advanced 
Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC al-
gorithms  predicated  on  the  single  scattering  approximation  has  been 
significantly enhanced (Matsui and Kageyama, 2022). The Atmospheric

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is fixing the random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of experiments. By setting a fixed seed, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated will always be the same, allowing for consistent results across different runs of the same experiment. Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms or operations where possible, reducing the reliance on random processes. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods can help improve robustness and reduce variability due to randomness. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and training/testing models on each subset, while ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce more stable predictions. These strategies together can help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline and improve overall performance.

Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, from general knowledge, we can provide some strategies used to address this issue.
