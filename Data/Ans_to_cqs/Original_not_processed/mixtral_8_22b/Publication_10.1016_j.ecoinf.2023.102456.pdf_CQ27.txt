Despite the positive outcomes yielded by our model, we contend that 
substantial improvements could be achieved by implementing a more 
flexible and complete neighbourhood relation Rk  in terms of variables. 
For  this  reason,  in  Section  5,  we  explore  an  architecture  capable  of 
learning  such  neighbourhood  relationships  through  experience  and 
accumulated data. 

5. Intelligent cellular scheme 

In this section, we aim to present an innovative architecture that uses 
existing  data  and  historical  databases  to  generalize  the  concept  of 
neighbourhood relations. To achieve it, machine learning is a powerful 
tool, with a backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) at the 
heart of it.

However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to 

̃
Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training a deep learning model, one would typically follow these steps:

1. Model Serialization: Save the trained model parameters into a file or database so they can be loaded later without retraining the model. This is often done using libraries specific to the programming language used, such as pickle in Python or joblib.

2. Platform Selection: Choose where to host the deployed model. This decision depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, computational resources required, latency requirements, and budget constraints. Some popular platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or local servers.

3. Deployment: Once the platform is selected, the serialized model needs to be uploaded onto the chosen platform. Depending on the platform, this step may involve setting up virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

4. API Creation: Create an application programming interface (API) to allow users or applications to access the predictions made by the deployed model. APIs are usually created using web frameworks like Flask or FastAPI in Python.

5. Testing: After deployment, thoroughly test the entire pipeline to ensure everything works correctly and efficiently. This includes testing the accuracy of the model's predictions, checking the performance under load, and verifying security measures.
