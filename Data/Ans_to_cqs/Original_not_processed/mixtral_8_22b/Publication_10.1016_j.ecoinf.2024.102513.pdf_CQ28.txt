approach provided a comprehensive understanding of LULC dynamics 
and enhanced the validation process for satellite imagery data.

While this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of land 
cover change in the Kerch Peninsula, several avenues for future research 
offer opportunities to enhance the technical aspects of historical land use 
and  land  cover  mapping.  Particularly,  addressing  the  challenge  of 
limited data availability for training deep neural networks in cases of 
sparse historical information warrants further investigation.

Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

of deep learning, a neural network was meticulously trained using these 
datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures.
