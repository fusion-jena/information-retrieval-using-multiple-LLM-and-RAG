Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by R. Gulzar et al. in their studies published in Ecological Informatics volume 81 (2024), with DOI numbers 1025862 and 1025866, is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to where the code repository is located (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket). To find out more about the availability of the code repository, it would be necessary to refer to the original research papers or contact the authors directly.
