2.  A CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance should be created on Google Cloud. Various choices are available by searching for ‘CUDA’ in the 
Google Cloud ‘Marketplace’. We recommend a VM named “Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97”, as it comes with the necessary drivers 
and compilers pre-installed. At the time of writing, this instance uses CUDA 11.6. Documentation is available if additional information about 
similar Google Cloud VMs is required.  

3.  The VM can be launched using the ‘Launch’ button on the aforementioned page, after which the required hardware specification of the VM must be 
selected. For most small projects, 16GB of memory and an SSD boot drive of 30GB should suffice. The number and type of GPUs can be selected at 
this stage.

other programming languages are also used, such as the Deep Learning 
Toolbox  by  MathWorks  (Beale  et  al.,  2018),  cuDNN  (Chetlur  et  al., 
2014), and Darknet (Redmon, 2013–2016).

Introduction and specifications 

This  appendix is  designed to provide practical advice on setting up  a CUDA-capable Google cloud instance, as well as installing drivers and 
software required to use Nvidia GPUs for scientific computing. This file will cover both the execution of GPU-accelerated code using cloud computing, 
via the Google Cloud service, and the installation of Nvidia GPU drivers and compilers onto this server, if required. There are many other providers of 
similar services. However, they vary in their setup procedures and requirements, and so we provide only a detailed example for the above mentioned 
provider.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that a CUDA-capable Virtual Machine (VM) instance was created on Google Cloud. It specifically recommends a VM named "Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97" for its pre-installed drivers and compilers. Furthermore, it describes launching the VM using the 'Launch' button on the Google Cloud Marketplace page and selecting the required hardware specifications. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.
