Although the origins of these data ranged from regional to global
sources, they were all consistent in their reproducibility on a global
scale. Climate data for historical and climate change projections is
provided by e.g. WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans, 2017), while a Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 30 m can be acquired from
the Copernicus program (ESA, 2023). The soil type can be found on the
hydrogeological map of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Nat-
ural Resources (Duscher et al., 2015). Vector data on roads and hunting
are available from the OpenStreetMap initiative, whereas landscape
metrics can be determined from ESA CCI land cover maps, as previously
mentioned.

Climate data were used without further processing as representative
of the effects of extreme temperatures and precipitation on rabbit

%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, but the given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or the datasets used within them. Instead, it discusses various types of geographical data such as climate data, digital elevation models, road networks, lithostratigraphic maps, hunting areas, and landscape metrics. These datasets have been used to analyze landscape dynamics and derive a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI). Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query based on the provided context. However, some examples of commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
