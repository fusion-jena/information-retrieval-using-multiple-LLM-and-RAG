region. The insets zoom in on important wetland landscapes in the Boreal region. Top-left: Zama Lake wetland area; bottom-right: Utikuma Lake; top-right: The Peace Athabasca Delta; and bottom-right: the McClelland Lake fen/wetland complex. 4. Discussion 381 This study produced two large-scale wetland inventory products using a fusion of open-access 382 satellite data, and machine learning methods. The two machine learning approaches that were 383 compared—convolutional neural networks and XGBoost—demonstrate a decent ability to predict 384 wetland classes and upland habitat across a large region. Some wetland classes, such as bog and 385 swamp, proved to be much harder to map. This is made clear in the relative F1-scores of the wetland 386 classes (Figure 3). In the comparisons to the photo-interpretation validation data sets (Table 3), it is 387 clear that the CNN model outperforms the XGB model in terms of overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, 388 and per-class F1-score. As expected,

Remote Sens. 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 22  These results will guide future large-scale spatial wetland inventory efforts in Canada. If deep 154 learning techniques are found to generate better products, new wetland inventories projects should 155 adopt deep learning workflows. If shallow learning methods still produce comparable results, they 156 should continue to be used in wetland inventory workflow; however, deep learning architectures 157 should still remain an active area of research with regard to methods for wetland mapping. 158 2. Methods  159 2.1. Study Area 160 Our study area includes the Boreal Natural Region (BNR) of Alberta, Canada, along with parts 161 of the Canadian Shield, Parkland, and Foothills Natural Regions (Figure 2). The study area comprises 162 60% (397,958 km2) of the total area of Alberta. Elevations range from 150 m above sea level in the 163 northeast to 1100 m near the Alberta–British Columbia border [53]. 164  Figure 2. Location of the study area

data sets: Two generated from photo interpretation and one ﬁeld validation data set. These results
will guide future large-scale spatial wetland inventory eﬀorts in Canada. If deep learning techniques
are found to generate better products, new wetland inventories projects should adopt deep learning
workﬂows. If shallow learning methods still produce comparable results, they should continue to
be used in wetland inventory workﬂow; however, deep learning architectures should still remain an
active area of research with regard to methods for wetland mapping.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors used convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost models for their analysis but does not specify any details regarding the availability or location of the code repositories. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
