factor  of  10  every  69  iterations  and  training  was  stopped  after  6900  iterations.  The  number  of 
units in the third fully connected layer (fc3) was changed according to the number of classes of 
training data. We set the batch size to 69 and momentum to 0.9 and applied L2 weight decay with 
penalty multiplier set to 5 Ã— 10-4, dropout ratio set to 0.5, CPU mode

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the training process was stopped after 6900 iterations. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on a fixed number of iterations rather than other common criteria such as validation loss plateau or early stopping. However, without additional context, we cannot definitively confirm this interpretation.
