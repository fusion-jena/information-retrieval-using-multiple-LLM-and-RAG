This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the available information. Further details would be required to accurately identify the relevant data repository link.

Based on the provided context, we can only infer that the system was implemented using TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4 alongside Python 3.6. It utilized ResNet 50 and ResNet 101 as backbone structures and employed anchor boxes of ratios 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. However, there is no mention of any links to data repositories containing the deep learning pipeline or related datasets.
