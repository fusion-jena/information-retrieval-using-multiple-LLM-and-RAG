curate,  less  biased  representations  of  a  species  niche  while  also 
accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets.

are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will 
raise warnings and highlighted messages in case the provided informa-
tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

Extending Fletcher et al., there are also options to use dataset specific 
weights  or  factor  interactions  to  account  for  differences  in  included 
datasets  (Leung  et  al.,  2019).  All  these  types  of  integration  are  also 
supported for inference on single datasets or can be used in sequential 
estimation. For example a potential use case easily enabled by ibis.iSDM 
could be to first fit a model using one biodiversity data source and a 
specific set of covariates such as broad climatic data, and then use the 
output of the resulting prediction as an offset to estimate the distribution 
with a different biodiversity or covariate data. Lastly, integration is also 
possibly through a dedicated model that combines multiple presence- 
only and presence-absence datasets together through a joint likelihood 
in a Bayesian setting (Fithian et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2019; Koshkina

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of biodiversity datasets and covariate data, which could suggest the use of structured data like CSV files. It also discusses the integration of multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets, but without specifying their format. Therefore, based on this context alone, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
