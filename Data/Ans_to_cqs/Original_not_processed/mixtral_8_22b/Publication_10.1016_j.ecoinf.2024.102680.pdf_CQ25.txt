Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Underwater  optical  images  often  have  limited  visibility  due  to 
complex  imaging  environments.  The  SPPF  module  in  the  original 
YOLOv8  network  has  an  insufficient  receptive  field,  resulting  in  low 
recognition accuracy for underwater objects of multiple sizes. To this 
end, we propose a new LKSP module to replace the SPPF module. In the 
LKSP module, we designed three large kernel convolution branches to 
increase  the  receptive  field  of  the  network.  This  module  allows  the 
network to perceive a wider range within the image, making it possible 
to determine the category of an object from the overall perspective of the 
object  and  its  surroundings.  The  large  kernel  convolution  can  learn 
complex  underwater  object  features  in  deep  feature  maps.  These  fea-
tures  can be reused in  subsequent layers  to  improve the  efficiency of 
parameter utilization and enhance the expression ability of the model.

The backbone is the core part of the object detection network. Its 
main function is to extract the feature information of objects from im-
ages. The backbone used in UODN is CSMBDarknet, which is composed 
of  the  Conv,  CSMB,  and  LKSP  modules.  CSMBDarknet  is  designed  to 
effectively  extract  and  analyze  the  features  of  objects  in  underwater 
environments.  Compared  with  the  backbone  of  YOLOv8,  cross  stage 
partial  darknet  (CSPDarknet),  which  comprises  the  Conv,  cross  stage 
partial  bottleneck  with  2  convolutions  (C2f),  and  spatial  pyramid 
pooling fast (SPPF) modules, we used the CSMB module to replace the 
C2f module for more effective feature extraction from underwater op-
tical images, obtaining both shallow and deep feature maps. The shallow 
feature maps have high-resolution feature projections, but the extracted 
feature information is relatively basic and limited. In contrast, the deep

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. More specifically, the model aims to accurately detect objects in underwater optical images, which are typically characterized by poor visibility due to complex imaging environments. The model, called Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN), is based on the YOLOv8 architecture but introduces several modifications to better handle the unique challenges posed by underwater images. One such modification is the replacement of the SPPF module in YOLOv8 with a newly proposed LKSP module, which increases the receptive field of the network and enables it to recognize objects of various sizes more effectively. Another key change is the use of the CSMB module instead of the C2f module for feature extraction, which helps capture more comprehensive and rich feature information from underwater images. Overall, the goal of this deep learning model is to improve the accuracy and robustness of underwater object detection, which has important applications in fields such as marine biology, oceanography, and underwater robotics.
