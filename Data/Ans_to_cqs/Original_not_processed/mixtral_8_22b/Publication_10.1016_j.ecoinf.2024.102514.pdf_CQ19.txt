formulate a framework for managing their water resources (Cosgrove 
and  Loucks,  2015).  In  short,  a  robust  comprehensive  approach  is 
necessary for the management and monitoring of water resources.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow and PyTorch. These frameworks offer tools and libraries that can be used to develop and train deep learning models. Without further information from the authors or the source code, it cannot be determined which framework was used in this study.
