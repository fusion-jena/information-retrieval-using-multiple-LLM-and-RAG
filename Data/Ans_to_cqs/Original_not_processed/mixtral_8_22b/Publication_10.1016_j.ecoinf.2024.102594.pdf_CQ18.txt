Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

ReduceLROnPlateau was as follows: If the validation loss value did not 
decrease  after  5  consecutive  epochs,  the  learning  rate  was  halved.  If 
there was no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive 
epochs, the training process was terminated. Both model training and 
inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.

During the DeepLabV3+ model training process, feeding large-size 
images directly to the network may lead to memory overflow. There-
fore, it is necessary to cut all remote sensing images and semantic labels 
of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks for input. To 
maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping 
approach in the model prediction stage, we set the cropping size to 32 ×
32  pixels  with  a  redundancy  rate  of  0.5.  In  continuing,  70%  of  the 
dataset  was  used  for  training  and  the  remaining  for  validation.  The 
training set was enhanced by: (i) Flipping the images and labels along 
the X or Y axis; (ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while 
the  labels remain unchanged; (iii)  Randomly rotating  the images and 
◦
labels by 90
; and (iv) randomly adding noise to the 
images  while  maintaining  the  labels  unchanged  (Ye  et  al.,  2022).

8.55% compared to the UAV_2.5 m model, and the OA of the UAV_16m 
model has reduced by 7.78% compared to the UAV_10m model. Mean-
while,  the  discrepancies  in  the  classification  results  were  mainly 
distributed in the karst landscape area in the southern part of the study 
area and marked in  red in  Fig. 6, and  most of the PlatSpe and  water 
surrounded by mixed forests could not be accurately identified.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is ReduceLROnPlateau. This means that if the validation loss value does not decrease after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate will be halved. Additionally, if there is no decrease in the validation loss value after ten consecutive epochs, the training process will be terminated. All model training and inference are executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.
