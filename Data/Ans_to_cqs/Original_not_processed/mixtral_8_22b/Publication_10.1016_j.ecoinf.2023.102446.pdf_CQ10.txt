Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Fig. 5. The first column implies the number of links generated by the source variables, and the second column denotes the number of links received by target 
variables from all the sources. The X-axis shows 104 weeks, and the Y-axis refers to the number of connections. The pink and green colour denotes the time series of a 
number of links generated for mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE), whereas the maroon and purple colors indicate the number of links received by 
target variables in the form of MI and TE. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Fig. 6. (a) – (c) shows the average transfer entropy (TE) bits information of 104 weeks of two years at different lags for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem 
respiration (RE), and latent heat (LH), respectively (d) – (e) implies the average number of TE links of 104 weeks for NEE, RE, and LH at different lags.
