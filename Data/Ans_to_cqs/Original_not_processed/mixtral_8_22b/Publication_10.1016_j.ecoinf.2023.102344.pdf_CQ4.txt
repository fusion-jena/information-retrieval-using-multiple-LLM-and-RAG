Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

means the images where the extracted numerical features were used in 
Approach 1 during training were the exact images used in training in

Approach  2  utilized  the  raw  bivalve  images  as  inputs  to  the  opti-
mized pre-trained networks of EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, 
and InceptionV3. Unlike Approaches 1 and 3, Approach 2 has no PCA- 
NCA  integration  as  the  extraction  of  features  was  not  manually  per-
formed, rather the built-in architecture of these four pre-trained deep 
networks  (Fig.  3)  extracted  millions  of  possible  features  that  are  not 
visible to human eyes for visual discrimination. Despite this supposedly 
advantageous  aspect  of  the  image-based  pre-trained  network,  only 
EfficientNet-B0 and InceptionV3 resulted in a 1.135 and 1.009 increase 
factor in accuracy as compared to its equivalent model to Approach 1 
(Table  1).  This  resulted  in  InceptionV3  being  the  most  accurate  and 
sensitive  model  in  Approach  2  with  scores  of  90.13%  and  87.45% 
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 9). The 9.87% Hamming loss of InceptionV3 is

output that is suitable for the target output. It teaches the network to 
learn to map its high-dimensional input data to usually low-dimensional

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), including architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, along with their components like shortcut connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling, and skip connections. Additionally, it mentions two approaches for training models, one involving Principal Component Analysis - Neighborhood Component Analysis (PCA-NCA) integration and another utilizing raw bivalve images as inputs to optimized pre-trained networks. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of data augmentation techniques in the provided context, I cannot accurately determine what methods were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
