Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The study does not use any standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses various environmental, climatic, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic data sources for its analysis. These include maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, soil water content, soil organic carbon content, soil pH, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to city, and human population density. The specific sources for these datasets are India Meteorological Department (IMD), OpenLandMap, Lembrechts et al., 2020, GTOPO30, Weiss et al., 2018, and Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4).
