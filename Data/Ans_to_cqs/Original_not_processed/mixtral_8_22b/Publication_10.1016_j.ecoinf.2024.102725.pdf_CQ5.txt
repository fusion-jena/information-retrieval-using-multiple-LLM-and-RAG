This article presents a new high-quality NDVI image product and a
technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high
spatial resolution. This framework offers a feasible method for recon-
structing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM
technology framework, we successfully produce a Sentinel-2 normalized
NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth
physiological cycles. The key concept of the algorithm is the introduc-
tion of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates
optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial
and temporal dimensions. By minimizing the sum of squares of the
combined prediction errors within a specific time period, the algorithm
achieves an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel
scale. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial feature
information of two prediction models, providing a robust approach for

Helpful Answer:

The study primarily uses MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06, spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. These data were obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and underwent pre-processing steps such as mosaicking and clipping. The data access link is <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4>.

While this information does not explicitly mention any commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it provides details about the specific dataset used in the study. The MCD43A4 V6.1 data is part of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, which provide various land surface reflectance data.

Therefore, the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be the MCD43A4 V6.1 data, specifically for satellite path h27v06 during the mentioned time frame.
