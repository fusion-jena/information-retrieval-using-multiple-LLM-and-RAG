over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

average  temperatures.  Then,  we  averaged  a  subset  of  the  monthly 
average  temperatures  (1970–2000)  to  obtain  12  datasets  valid  for 
1970–2000, one for each month.

Fig. A.10. Seasonal patterns in KGE scores (first column), pbias (second column), MAE (third column), and RMSE (fourth column) that we obtained in the cross- 
validations  when  employing  each  algorithm  to  interpolate  weather  station  data  (top  row)  and  downscale  WorldClim  (middle  row)  and  CHELSA  (bottom  row). 
Model performance improves as KGE values approach 1; KGE values between 0 and 0.5 indicate poor model performance. Low pbias values reflect accurate model 
prediction; the optimal pbias value is 0. Model performance increases as MAE and RMSE values decrease.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention how they split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, they discuss fitting Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) using specific packages and parameters. They also mention evaluating variable importance in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using the Olden method. The study focuses on interpolating weather station data and downscaling WorldClim and CHELSA datasets. To evaluate model performance, they use metrics such as KGE scores, pbias, MAE, and RMSE. Based on this information, it can be assumed that the authors followed standard practices for splitting the data into training and testing sets, but the exact details are not mentioned in the given context.
