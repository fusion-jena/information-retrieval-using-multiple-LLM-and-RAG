Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The objective function and expected function are denoted by U(D, G) 
and E. D and G presents the discriminator and generator networks. D(x) 
calculates the likelihood that x is the true data (i.e., real data) that is 
based  on  training  reference  samples.  In  the  3D  GAN  network,  we 
employed a conditional map unit to produce synthetic samples from a 
random  noise  vector,  like  the  Generative  Adversarial  Minority  Over-
sampling (GAMO) (Subhra Mullick et al., 2019) and 3D-HyperGAMO (S. 
K.  Roy  et  al.,  2021),  only  for  classes  with  a  low  number  of  training 
samples.  The  benefit  of  such  a  methodology  is  that  it  eliminates  the 
problem of imbalanced data, which is typical in wetland mapping. In 
particular, in the 3D GAN model, the 3D patch generator uses seven (c (cid:0)
1, c presents the number of classes) units, one unit for each of the classes 
g samples (see 
with minor ground-truth data. Thus, the unit Ui generates γi
Eq. 2).

Many  ecosystems,  particularly  wetlands,  are  significantly  degraded  or  lost  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and 
anthropogenic  activities.  Simultaneously,  developments  in  machine  learning,  particularly  deep  learning 
methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present 
deep  and  very deep  models necessitate  a greater  number  of  training data, which  are costly,  logistically  chal-
lenging,  and  time-consuming  to  acquire.  Thus,  we  explore  and  address  the  potential  and  possible  limitations 
caused  by  the  availability  of  limited  ground-truth  data  for  large-scale  wetland  mapping.  To  overcome  this 
persistent  problem  for  remote  sensing  data  classification  using  deep  learning  models,  we  propose  3D  UNet 
Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training

Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies used in deep learning pipelines to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like ensemble methods or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by randomness. It should be noted that these strategies may not directly apply to the specific 3DUNetGSFormer architecture mentioned in the context without further details.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
The context does not provide any direct information about managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, so I cannot give a helpful answer based solely on the given text.
