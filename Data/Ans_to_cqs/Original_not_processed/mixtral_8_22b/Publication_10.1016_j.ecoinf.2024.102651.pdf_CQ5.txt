tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

The experimental results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate 
the enhancement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating 
CAM into the residual network. Regardless of “medium”  or “small”  or 
the entire dataset, the best classification results are achieved using the 
CA-Hybrid  network.  Notably,  the  experimental  results  demonstrate  a 
positive correlation between image size and classification performance. 
Specifically, larger image tend to yield better classification outcomes. 

4. Discussion

CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is 
constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervi-
dae  localized  by  YOLOv7.  Within  the  CA-Hybrid  network,  by  intro-
ducing the CAM (Woo et al., 2018) in the CNN, the network was able to 
focus more on critical features, which boosted the generalization ability 
of the model. Finally, when utilizing the same classification network for 
both small  objects(pixels less than 32*32) and  medium objects(pixels 
between 32*32 and 96*96) to evaluate the influence of image size on 
classification performance, the medium objects achieved higher classi-
fication  accuracy  compared  to  small  objects  under  identical  network. 
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of our monitoring pipeline 
with  object  detection  networks,  the  effectiveness  of  the  pipeline  was 
demonstrated. The pipeline effectively resolves the issue of background

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the experiments were conducted using different sizes of images, including "medium" and "small," and the entire dataset. It also notes that larger images tended to yield better classification outcomes. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used, we can infer that they likely included various sizes of images.
