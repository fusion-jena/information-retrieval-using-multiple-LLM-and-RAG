2.3.3. Optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD)  

(i)  Optimal scale and discretization parameters 

As OPGD requires continuous data to be discretized before further 
analysis,  choosing  appropriate  discretization  parameters  (i.e.,  the 
number and method of discretization breakpoints) is crucial for accurate 
identification  of  driver  explanatory  power.  The  discretization  process 
involved  five  methods:  standard  deviation  (SD),  natural  breaks  (NB), 
equal  interval  (EI),  quantile  (QU),  and  geometric  interval  (GI)(Song 
et al., 2020). Following previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 
2023), we considered that too many or too few breakpoints would result 
in  information  redundancy  (insufficiency).  Therefore,  the  number  of 
breakpoints was configured to range from 4 to 13 in this study.

time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

2021b; Yang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023). However, certain VIs, such as 
the NDVI, can become saturated, reducing sensitivity in areas with dense 
vegetation, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions (Qiu et al., 
2018;  Yan  et  al.,  2022). Fortunately, Camps-Valls  et  al.  (2021)  intro-
duced the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) using 
machine learning and kernel function theory. In all application evalu-
ations of different biomes and climate zones,this novel nonlinear vege-
tation index is more robust to saturation and mixed pixel problems than 
NDVI  (Camps-Valls  et  al.,  2021),  making  it  a  promising  proxy  for 
studying the spatial patterns of vegetation growth in dense forest areas.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques to avoid overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from dominating the output. These methods help generalize the model better by avoiding overreliance on any particular feature or pattern in the training dataset.
