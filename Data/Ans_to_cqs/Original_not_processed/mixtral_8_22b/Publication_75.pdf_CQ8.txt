Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

dataset.  A  detailed  description  of  the  CNN  network  is  provided  in 
Table 1. The network has proven to have the same accuracy performance 
as more complex and deeper networks but with a shallow training time, 
as shown in the next section.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further details, it cannot be determined exactly where the code repository is located.
