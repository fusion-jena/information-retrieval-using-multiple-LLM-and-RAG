FIGURE 4 | Test set precision-recall curves. Top: the model’s success in identifying “Glycaspis” vs. “non-Glycaspis” (left), “Psyllaephagus” vs. “non-Psyllaephagus”
(middle), and “Thaumastocoris” vs. “non-Thaumastocoris” (right). The plots indicate the recall and precision of the model’s predictions as a function of its conﬁdence
threshold (Tcs). The black dotted line depicts 0.7 conﬁdence. Bottom: Recall vs. Precision curves of the three focal species. Asterisks depict a conﬁdence threshold
of 0.7. Note that the recall plots of “Glycaspis” and “Psyllaephagus” do not reach 1, as a few insects were not identiﬁed even with Tcs = 0.1.

INTRODUCTION

State of the Art: Machine Learning for
Insect Ecoinformatics
Ecologists strive to document and interpret the abundance
and distribution of organisms. Field observations are a major
means to this end, and the observational data that have
accumulated over the decades form a solid basis for our
view of ecosystems. In recent years, technological advances
enabled the solidiﬁcation of observational ecology into a
new scientiﬁc branch, ecoinformatics, which applies big-data
methods to ecological questions (Rosenheim and Gratton, 2017).
Ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases,
collected over long time periods across multiple locations (see
the GBIF Home Page1). The available data vary in format and
reliability (Gueta and Carmel, 2016) as they originate from
multiple sources, such as long-term ecological monitoring (Lister
and Garcia, 2018), citizen science projects (Hallmann et al., 2017),
or museum catalogs (Short et al., 2018).

Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics

data points describe the performance attained by a model that
accepts all identiﬁcations, as its Tcs is minimal (0). Such a plot
can guide users in adjusting model parameters to their needs. If
fewer detections are accepted (low recall), precision increases.

Tables 3, 4 illustrate the types of recall (Table 3) and precision
(Table 4) errors made by the model when the conﬁdence
threshold was set to 0.7. The model rarely confused between our
three focal species (gray areas in Tables 3, 4). It made some false
positive predictions, particularly for the class “Psyllaephagus”
(bold text in Table 4, not tagged by the expert but predicted
by the model). Most of the missed predictions, however, were
false negatives (bold text in Table 3, tagged by the expert but not
identiﬁed by the model).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the provided information. However, it is worth noting that the paper mentions the use of datasets from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) homepage. Unfortunately, without additional details or access to the full research article, I am unable to determine if the authors shared their specific dataset or deep learning pipeline on any public repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad.
