stations in Poyang Lake, and the only one in the southern lake and NWNNR area. It is located at 

the  front  edge  of  the  Ganjiang  River  Delta,  formed  by  the  alluvium  of  the  middle  and  south 

branches of Ganjiang River, merging into the open water of Poyang Lake (Fig. 1). Daily average 

values of real-time data from this station are used to record nine water quality variables, including 

phytoplankton biomass (as Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), water temperature 

(WT),  electrical  conductivity  (EC),  dissolved  oxygen  (DO),  turbidity  (NTU),  chemical  oxygen 

demand  of  Mn  (COD),  and  ammonia  nitrogen  (NH3-N)  (Table  1).  They  are  monitored  by  a 

real-time  water  quality  information  system  operated  by  the  China  National  Environmental 

Monitoring  Centre  (CNEMC,  https://szzdjc.cnemc.cn/).  Daily  water  levels  at  Waizhou  station
