classification is described as:

= [l1 ∈ l2] for all U⋀LTA (cid:0) LU

(10)

l=1

Where U is the union of l1 and l2 classification, such that the higher-
level classification (l1) with more classes (n = 32) is represented as el-
ements (∈) of the lower-level classification (l2) with fewer classes (n =
6), the nested classification between l1 & l2 is the reclassification of the
thematic spectral classes of l1 into the information classes of l2. Based on

a simple linear regression, the l1 / l2 crosstabulation results proved
insufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community
configurations.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model mentioned in Mohedano et al.'s paper from 2017. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether they utilized GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources during their research process.
