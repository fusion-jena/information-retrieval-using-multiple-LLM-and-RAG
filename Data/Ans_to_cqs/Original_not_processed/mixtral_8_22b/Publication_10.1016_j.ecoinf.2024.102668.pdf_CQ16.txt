Appendix C. Site: S2 

C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.

Appendix F. Controlled test 

The Fig. F.19 highlights intra- and inter-recorder variability, demonstrating how frequency responses can be affected by manufacturing conditions 
and wear. Through power spectral density and coherence data, it underscores the variations between and within recorders, indicating that even 
devices of the same model can exhibit differing responses. This variability, attributed to differences in manufacturing and the potential wear over time, 
emphasizes the need for coherence metrics. Such metrics are essential for identifying frequency bands where recorders show comparable performance, 
offering a strategy to adjust for these variances in ecoacoustic data analysis, and ensuring more reliable acoustic index evaluations.

The coherence measure results coincide with what is visually evident 
in the frequency responses of the recorders. After 12 kHz, the two de-
vices  show  different  trends,  with  the  SM4  attenuating  in  high  fre-
quencies, consistent with its datasheet, and the AudioMoth maintaining 
a quasi-linear gain. The bottom panel of Fig. 4 illustrates this behavior. 
In our controlled test, illustrated in Fig. 5, we compared 15 Audio-
Moth recorders—5 of each version (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2)—against 2 SM4s, 
with  each  recording  a  white  noise  signal  at  a  sampling  frequency  of 
48,000  Hz simultaneously. A total  of 119 recordings,  each  15 s long, 
were obtained from each recorder. For this analysis, one of the SM4s 
served  as  the  reference,  and  the  PSDs  from  the  other  recorders  were 
averaged to establish a common frequency range for comparison. The 
application  of  our  methodology  within  this  range  showed  reduced

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a direct answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, some commonly used criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, achieving a desired level of accuracy or precision, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs during the training process. It should be noted that the specific criteria may vary depending on the nature of the task, the type of machine learning algorithm being used, and the goals of the project.
