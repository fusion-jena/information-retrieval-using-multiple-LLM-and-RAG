and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

the short time series of an EF calculation is considered a small sample
test object, we will choose the fast learning and weak generalization
Gaussian kernel function to address the nonlinear relationships among
the variables and to simplify the diﬃculty of modeling using relatively
few parameters. All the advantages previously mentioned enable the
SVM method to eﬀectively overcome the high-dimensional problem
(Chapelle et al., 2002; Chapelle and Vapnik, 2000; Dong et al., 2003).
Given a training dataset of EF, D = {(x1, y1)…(xi, yi), xϵRn, yϵR}, where i
is the number of samples, the EF is a function of the impact indexes as

and f() is the neuronal activation function.

Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the proportion or ratio of data allocated for training, testing, and validation sets. However, it mentions some relevant aspects related to data handling and processing in the context of deep learning and other machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM).

In general, when working with deep learning models, one common approach is to divide the available data into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. This division helps evaluate the performance of the model during different stages of development and fine-tuning. Although the exact proportions may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset and the complexity of the task, a typical distribution could be around 60-80% for the training set, 10-20% for the validation set, and 10-20% for the test set.

The training set is used to fit the model, allowing it to learn from the input data and adjust its internal parameters accordingly. The validation set serves as a tool for tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting, while the test set remains unseen until the final evaluation stage, providing an independent measure of the model's predictive power.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these criteria, it discusses various aspects of deep learning and machine learning techniques applied to EF calculations. It highlights the importance of addressing nonlinear relationships among variables, dealing with high-dimensional problems, and choosing appropriate activation functions and weights for neuron connections within the network architecture. These considerations contribute to building accurate and efficient deep learning models but do not directly specify how to partition the data for training purposes.
