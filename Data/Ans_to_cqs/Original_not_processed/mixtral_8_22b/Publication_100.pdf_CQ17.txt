4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained 𝑀 = 5 models with batch size 𝐵 = 64 and a base learning
rate 𝛼 = 10−4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10−3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Eq. (1). We
chose 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999 and 𝜖 = 10−8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ∼14 days.

4.3. Loss function

The loss function, which is optimized during training, measures
the quality of a set of network parameters 𝜽 w.r.t. the training data
 = {(𝒙𝑖, 𝒚𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1, under some regularizing prior assumptions. We use a
standard loss function (; 𝜽) whose minimization corresponds to max-
imizing the posterior probability of the parameters given the training
data. As it is commonly done in machine learning (see e.g. Goodfellow
et al., 2016), we assume a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian prior over
the network parameters (corresponding to 
2 regularization) and a
Gaussian likelihood function with mean ̂𝝁𝑖 ∶= ̂𝝁(𝒙𝑖; 𝜽) ∈ R5 and
diagonal covariance matrix with logarithmic elements ̂𝒔𝑖 ∶= ̂𝒔(𝒙𝑖; 𝜽) ∈
R5:

the Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) variant of stochastic gradient descent

based on the statistics of previous updates to speed up convergence.
During training, we periodically evaluate the prediction error of the
model (i.e., the current set of parameters) on a held-out validation set
and keep the configuration 𝜽∗ with the lowest error as the final model.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, two main regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. Firstly, they utilized dropout as a Bayesian approximation method, which represents model uncertainty in deep learning. This technique involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations between them. Secondly, they applied L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, L2 regularization discourages large weights, thus reducing overfitting. These regularization methods contribute to improving the generalization performance of the models.
