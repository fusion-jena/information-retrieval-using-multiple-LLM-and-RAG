3.2.1.6. Field  data. The  crucial  feature  in  smart  farming  is  field  data 
since smart systems’ decision-making relies on the actual data derived 
from the field (Collado et al., 2019; Krisnawijaya et al., 2022; Saiz-Rubio 
and  Rovira-M´as,  2020).  The  field  data  are  retrieved  from  parameters 
measured  from  the  crop,  animal,  soil,  and  environment.  These  mea-
surements are based on the agricultural domains and the purposes of the 
system. The field data feature is presented in Fig. 10.

more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss the use of deep learning techniques in analyzing generated data within smart farming systems.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or ensemble methods to account for variability due to random initialization or stochastic processes during training. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can help optimize model performance despite inherent randomness.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this context, I cannot provide a detailed strategy tailored to the given scenario.
