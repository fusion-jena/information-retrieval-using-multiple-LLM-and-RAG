the training data only.

To prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles, the
tiles retrieved from all 50 training photographs were collected in one
folder and shuﬄed, before they were split into training, validation and
test set. In this regard, the validation set is used during training for the
ﬁne tuning of hyperparameters and model selection (Hastie et al.,
2009). Only after the best model setup has been found, its prediction
error is assessed once again on the test set. For splitting the whole set of
samples into the three sets, we ﬁrst took a random sample of 10% from
the total number of tiles as validation set and then a further sample of
10% as test set. The remaining 80% of the tiles were used as training
set. To further increase the number of sample tiles, we performed data
augmentation on the training set. Data augmentation is a common
practice in machine learning to artiﬁcially increase the number of
training samples by applying slight transformation on the original data,

All statistics were performed in R (version 3.3.1). The best model
was chosen based on the two parameters accuracy and loss, whereby
loss serves as a measure on how far model predictions diﬀer from the
actual class. Model accuracy and loss were calculated for both training
and validation set. We tested the performance of the ﬁnal model on two
diﬀerent data sets: 1) on individual tiles and 2) on whole repeat pho-
tographs. Prediction accuracy on individual tiles was calculated using
the 5796 tiles from the test set (= 10%), which has been separated from
the total number of samples before training. We evaluated the accuracy
on whole repeat photographs based on the image pairs of the second set
of photographs. The classiﬁcation results for each of these 34 images
were compared to the corresponding manual classiﬁcation (reference
data). A confusion matrix was prepared for each photograph in-
dividually. The confusion matrix consists of pixel numbers for true

Although the use of pre-trained models has proven to be advanta-
geous for many image recognition tasks (Weiss et al., 2016), we decided
to train the model from scratch. We recognized that our speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation problem was too diﬀerent from the pre-trained networks.
Moreover, we considered the number of labeled samples available
(nearly 30,000 per class) as large enough for training our own network.

We trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers
and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected
layer (Clevert et al., 2015). As optimizer we chose the adaptive ADAM
(Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
Training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations
(= 90 epochs).

Helpful Answer:
The authors ensured the generalizability of their deep learning model through several measures. Firstly, they prevented spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles by collecting all tiles from the training photographs in one folder, shuffling them, and then splitting them into training, validation, and test sets. This approach helps to avoid any potential bias or correlation between adjacent tiles. Secondly, they employed a validation set during training for fine-tuning hyperparameters and model selection. After determining the best model setup, they assessed its prediction error on the test set. Thirdly, they increased the number of sample tiles by performing data augmentation on the training set. Data augmentation involves applying slight transformations to the original data to artificially increase the number of training samples. Lastly, they opted not to use pre-trained models due to the specific nature of their classification problem and the availability of nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class. Instead, they trained their own network from scratch. These measures collectively contribute to enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning model.
