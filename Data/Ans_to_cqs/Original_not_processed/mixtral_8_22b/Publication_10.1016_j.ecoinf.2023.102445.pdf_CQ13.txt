input into the model network for training.

In Experiment 9, we achieve a reduction in the number of parame-
ters, GFLOPs, and model size while incurring a marginal loss of 0.8% in 
P and 0.1% in R, and a minor decrease in mAP. In contrast, Experiment 
10 yields a significant reduction in the number of parameters and model 
size, with only 36.32% of the original model parameters and 38.71% of 
its  model  size.  Although  a  reduction  in  the  mAP  is  observed,  the 
improved  model  demonstrates  the  shortest  processing  time.  Further-
more, R reaches its peak, and P remains on par with the original model, 
achieving an optimal balance point. These findings show that the com-
bination  of  the  Multicat  module,  Reduce  detection  head,  and  C2flite 
module has the best overall performance (Fig. 11). The Multicat module 
significantly offsets the large increase in GFLOPs and processing time 
due to reduced detection heads, while the combination with the C2flite

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

experimental  results  prove  that  in  terms  of  considering  the  accuracy, 
speed  and  model  size,  YOLO_MRC  has  the  best  overall  performance 
compared to the other models in the experiment. 

4. Discussion 

Real-time  detection  and  counting  of  pests  in  a  specific  area  are 
important  for  timely  pest  spotting  and  control.  This  work  helps  to 
quickly determine the distribution and quantity of pests in the current 
environment, not only by providing critical data for agricultural man-
agement but also by helping to optimize the use of pesticides, thereby 
preventing  unnecessary  pesticide  waste  and  environmental  pollution 
(Dhankhar and Kumar, 2023; Liu et al., 2021).
