Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in developing a bat call detection and classification method. Regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in CNNs to prevent overfitting. Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps reduce co-dependencies between neurons and improves generalization. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting. Other common regularization techniques include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. Without more information from the given context, it cannot be determined which specific regularization methods were used in the development of the bat call detection and classification method.
