hyperparameter  automatically.  However,  given  their  capability  to 
assemble 40 models in one simulation, we are leveraging this advantage 
to narrow down the selection of machine learning models. Subsequently, 
based on the suggestions of the Lazy Predict algorithm, ML models were 
further fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques. This process 
led to the development of robust ML models for each SWQP one after 
another. These ML models were optimized for each water quality mea-
sure. XGB, RF, and ET were chosen to build a stacking-based ANN meta 
ML  model  based  on  their  best  performance  and  the  entire  autoML 
model’s results.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain any specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models for water quality prediction, including the application of hyperparameter tuning techniques and the selection of optimal models like XGB, RF, and ET. It also mentions the use of statistical and artificial neural network models for water quality prediction in the Godavari River Basin, India. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer regarding data annotation techniques from the given context.
