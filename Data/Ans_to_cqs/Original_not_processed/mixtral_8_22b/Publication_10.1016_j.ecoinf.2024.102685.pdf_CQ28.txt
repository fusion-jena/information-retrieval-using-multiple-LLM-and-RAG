et al., 2022; Veettil et al., 2020). New insights are needed to overcome 
the spatial and spectral limitations offered by historical platforms, such 
as the Landsat missions (Chen et al., 2016). In this study, we focused our 
attention  on  the  importance  to  account  for  phenological  differences 
between  species  in  the  application  of  machine  learning  algorithms 
trained  on  a  large  ground-truth  dataset.  This  would  allow  for  more 
effective extraction of reflectance features, enabling the acquisition of 
temporal information on the distribution of lagoon seagrass species.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform.
