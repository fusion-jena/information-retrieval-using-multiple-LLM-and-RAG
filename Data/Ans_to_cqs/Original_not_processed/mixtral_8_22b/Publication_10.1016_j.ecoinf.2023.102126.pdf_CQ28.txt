Huber, R., D’Onofrio, C., Devaraju, A., Klump, J., Loescher, H.W., Kindermann, S.,

The results obtained in relation to the four FAIR principles agreed 
with the study conducted by Huber et al. (2021), with the goal of ana-
lysing  the  state-of-the-art  integration  and  data  analysis  approaches 
implemented  by  world‑leading  research  infrastructures  in  the  earth 
system and environmental sciences, including some of the repositories 
analysed in our work. They concluded that, although data repositories 
have generally made the deposited data searchable by researchers, it is 
particularly difficult for machines with the current resources offered by 
these platforms. In general, they stated that although the data were often 
persistently  identified,  as  we  also  observed,  the  way  to  proceed  with 
them  was  designed  for  navigation  and  manual  processing,  which  is 
typically challenging or impossible for machines. This fact is particularly 
relevant regarding interoperability and, above all, reusability in areas

2.2. Downloading the records 

The  following  variables  were  imported  for  each  record:1)  type  of 
content (dataset, data study, software, or repository), 2) data source (the 
source  from  which  the  data  were  obtained),  and  3)  Web  of  Science 
category of the data source (i.e. multidisciplinary agriculture, ecology, 
biodiversity conservation, and environmental sciences). 

The bibliographic information collected using the DCI for each re-
cord  includes  authors/creators,  year  of  publication  (the  collected  re-
cords  were  published  from  1900  to  the  present),  title  of  the  dataset, 
publisher (understood as the repository in which the data are deposited 
or the organisation responsible for making the data available), version, 
and permanent identifier (e.g. a unique URL, databank accession num-
ber, or another permanent identifier such as Handle (hdl) (http://www. 
handle.net/)).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given sources do not provide specific information about the deployment platform of any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on these references alone.
