An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The methodologies used for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline vary depending on the specific application and requirements. However, some common sources include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys involve collecting information through questionnaires or interviews, which can provide valuable insights into human behavior, preferences, and opinions. Sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR systems, and other IoT devices, can capture real-time data about physical phenomena like temperature, humidity, light intensity, and object movement. Public datasets, available online or through government agencies, offer large volumes of diverse data that can be leveraged for training machine learning algorithms. For instance, satellite imagery from platforms like Google Earth Engine has been employed for creating land use/cover classification systems. Additionally, random forests have proven useful in processing remote sensing data to categorize different land cover types.
