3.4. Deep learning 

3.4.1. SLSTM method 

An LSTM network is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn 
long-term dependencies in sequential data, and an SLSTM model is an 
extension of an LSTM model that can forecast seasonal time-series data 
(Ma  et  al.,  2015),(Graves  and  Graves,  2012).  Compared  with  LSTM 
models, SLSTM models include an additional input layer for processing 
seasonal time series, which is fed through a seasonal convolutional layer 
to  extract  relevant  seasonal  features.  An  SLSTM  unit  involves  the 
following steps:  

(1)  Seasonal decomposition is performed using Eq. (7), in which sx t 
represents the data after seasonal decomposition, χt  denotes the

Deep learning-based air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan

Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning methods are being widely applied to create models directly from large volumes of complex data. This suggests that various types of data formats could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline, such as images, audio files, videos, or structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format would depend on the specific application and problem domain. For instance, if the goal is to analyze air pollution levels based on satellite imagery, then the data format used might be images. On the other hand, if the objective is to predict agricultural product sales based on historical sales data, then the data format might be a CSV file containing time-series data. Therefore, without further information about the specific use case, it is difficult to determine exactly what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline.
