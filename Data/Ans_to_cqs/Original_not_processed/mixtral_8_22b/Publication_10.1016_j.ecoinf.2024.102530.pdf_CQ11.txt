flight time and performance. Flying time and performance is linked to 
many weather factors like temperature, wind, precipitation, solar radi-
ation, and these factors combined dictate if and when honey bees will 
take flight.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not include any specific links to a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query. However, based on the given sources, it appears that some datasets used in the study are available through the Données Québec platform (<https://www.donneesquebec.ca/>), which could potentially host the deep learning pipeline or related resources. To find out more about the availability of such resources, please visit the website and search for relevant keywords or contact the authors directly.
