1. Introduction 

Variability of animal abundances across space and time is a central 
theme of ecology (Koenig and Liebhold, 2016; Krebs, 2001; Lundberg 
et al., 2000). Spatiotemporal variations among the populations of the 
same  species  may  result  from  the  differential  responses  of  animal

ulations, adding the estimation burdens.

%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on any specific deep learning models or their development process. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model based solely on this context.
