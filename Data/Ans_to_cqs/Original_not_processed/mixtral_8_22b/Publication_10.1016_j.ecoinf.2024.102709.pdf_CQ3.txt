split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

Using this ideal split, a test was conducted using unprocessed data. 
This indicates that the test dataset appeared to be similar to the training 
data  because  it  consisted  of  images  of  the  extracted  clusters  without 
further processing. 

The  dataset  used  in  this  study  included  single-tree  point  clouds, 
images of single-trees, and *. csv containing the attributes used to pro-
duce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers (in two different 
point-thickness settings), labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the 
numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results 
of  our  digit  recognition  are  freely  available  under:  Doi:  https://doi.

3. Results 

3.1. Classification accuracy

Three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using our own data 
(clusters of extracted numbers), as described above, as input for training, 
whereas the other three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained with 
the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) 
dataset of handwritten digits, which can be used to train classification 
models (Deng, 2012).

helps  the  network  learn  the  probabilities  of  the  values  around  the 
continuous locations of the target bounding boxes (X. Li et al., 2020b). 
Thus, it focuses on the values near a label y, by explicitly increasing the 
probabilities of yi and yi + 1. This metric is used for the bounding box 
estimation. 

Classification loss (cls loss) measures the error in the predicted class 
probabilities  for  each  object  in  the  image  compared  with  the  ground 
truth.  When it is lower, the model is more accurate in predicting the 
class of the objects. This value was computed using a cross-entropy loss 
function (Terven and Cordova-Esparza, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the information provided.

Firstly, the term 'bounding box estimation' suggests that one of the techniques used could be bounding box annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles or squares around objects within an image to identify them. In this case, it seems like bounding box annotation might have been used to help the network learn the probabilities of the values around the continuous locations of the target bounding boxes.

Secondly, the use of 'ground truth' implies that they had some form of manually annotated data to compare their predictions against. Ground truth refers to the actual, known labels or categories assigned to data points, often done through manual annotation.

Lastly, while not directly mentioned, the process of extracting clusters of numbers and producing images from these clusters could suggest a form of semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves assigning every pixel in an image to a certain class or category, essentially creating a richer understanding of the image content.

However, without further details about how exactly the data was processed and annotated, these remain speculations. The text does not provide concrete evidence of the use of instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key-point annotation, or any other specific data annotation technique.
