in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

developers could expand on the code in supplement S1 to implement 
more  predictor  variables  and  write  a  custom  algorithm.  Finally,  the 
classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in 
their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing 
data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the 
number  of  correct  classifications  using  real  world  examples.  Current 
software attempting to ID bats are locked in a vacuum. Bats in the real 
world are not!

identification  of  species.  To  try  to  overcome  this  problem,  species 
identification  based  on  machine  learning  was  introduced  (Jennings 
et al., 2008; Parsons and Jones, 2000; Zamora-Gutierrez et al., 2016).

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling method to ensure that each set maintains similar proportions of classes or categories present in the original dataset. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of evaluating classification accuracy using real-world examples, which suggests that the authors may have considered splitting their data based on temporal or spatial factors relevant to bat identification in natural environments.
