hyperparameters for model architectures.  

2.  Partial training: Models are partially trained (on a small fraction of 
the data) to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations.  
3.  Successive Halving: The remaining configurations are grouped into 
sets of different sizes, and the associated models are trained further. 
The best-performing configurations in each set are promoted to the 
next  stage,  while 
the  under-performing  configurations  are 
eliminated. 

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until only one configuration re-
mains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

–  Recurrent Highway Network (RHN) (Zilly et al., 2016): to learn 
the  temporal  relations  between  the  results  of  the  previous  among 
convolved input features. The main idea behind recurrent networks 
is  to  use  an  internal  memory  to  store  information  about  previous 
processing steps. In this way, the network can take into account the 
historical context to better understand the inputs and produce more 
accurate  outputs.  However,  classical  recurrent  networks  can 
encounter  difficulties  when  training  long  sequences  due  to  the 
“vanishing gradient” phenomenon. Indeed, the longer the sequence, 
the more the backpropagation of the error can become diluted and no 
longer effective in adjusting the network parameters. To solve this 
problem, other recurring structures have been proposed like RHN. 
The RHN network is an extension of the LSTM ((Long-Short-Term- 
Memory) networks. Highway connections allow data to “skip” layers

The key idea behind Hyperband is to explore several configurations 
in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising con-
figurations. This enables a more efficient search of the hyperparameter 
space, particularly when computational resources are limited. In sum-
mary, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a ‘successive 
halving’  strategy  to  quickly  identify  promising  configurations  while 
eliminating those that show inferior performance. 

The  detail  of  the  grid  of  possible  combinations  is  presented.  The 
number of convolution layers is lower than that given in the article, the 
network has two convolution layers. Their size and the associated max- 
pooling will be determined in the following interval for each:

For more details on the theory of the elements discussed we refer the 
reader to the reference book (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This architecture 
involves  a  large  number  of  hyperparameters  related  to  the  different 
types of layers (convolutional or recurrent) and therefore a large number 
of  parameters.  As  a  reminder,  a  parameter  is  internal  to  the  neural 
network.  It  will  evolve  during  the  whole  training  process  A  hyper-
parameter is external to the training process, it defines the properties of 
the network. It remains static during the training process. 

The  HyperBand  algorithm  is  proposed  for  optimisation  and  is 

described in the next section.

Helpful Answer:

While the provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods help improve generalization by adding constraints to the learning process, thus preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

Dropout is a popular regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a sparse network. By doing so, dropout helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons and encourages them to learn individually useful features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the squared magnitude of all trainable weights. This discourages large weights and promotes smaller ones, leading to simpler models that generalize well.

Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring validation accuracy during training and halting the process once performance starts degrading. Data augmentation generates new samples from existing data through transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping, increasing dataset diversity and reducing overfitting risk. Batch normalization standardizes layer inputs across mini-batches, improving convergence speed and overall performance.
