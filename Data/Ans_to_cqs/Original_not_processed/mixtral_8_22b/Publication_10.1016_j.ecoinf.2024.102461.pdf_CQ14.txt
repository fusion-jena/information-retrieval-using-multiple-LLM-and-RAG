Kalkan and Maktav, 2018). For this reason, the first action taken was to 
perform atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a grid search or random search method was used for optimization.
