et al., 2018) and Giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca (Li et al., 2018). 
Examples of three different field applications of FIT were reported by for 
a closed population of black rhinoceros, based on the requirement for 
data granularity, frequency of monitoring and availability of local re-
sources using this same technique (Jewell et al., 2020).

Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization. Without more specific details from the context, it is impossible to determine exactly which techniques were employed in this case.
