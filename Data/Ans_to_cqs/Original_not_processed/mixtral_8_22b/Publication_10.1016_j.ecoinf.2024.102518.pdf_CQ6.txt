feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the nature of the data. These steps help ensure that the input data is clean, consistent, and well-structured for efficient processing by the neural network. Here are some common preprocessing techniques used in deep learning:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It ensures that the model learns from accurate and relevant data.

2. Normalization: Deep learning algorithms often perform better when numerical features have similar scales. Normalization rescales the data so that it falls within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling, Z-score Standardization, and Log Transformation.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling adjusts the scale of independent variables or features in the dataset. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling and Standardization help bring all features to a comparable scale, which improves convergence during optimization.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Neural networks cannot process categorical data directly. Therefore, encoding techniques like One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, or Target Encoding convert categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: High dimensional datasets can lead to overfitting, increased computational complexity, and reduced interpretability. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can reduce the number of dimensions without losing significant information.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated through transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, or adding noise. This technique is particularly useful in image classification tasks.
