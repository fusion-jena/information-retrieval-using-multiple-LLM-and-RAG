is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2â€“70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions the use of a larger FFT window size and fitting cow-specific parameters in the model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a helpful answer regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
