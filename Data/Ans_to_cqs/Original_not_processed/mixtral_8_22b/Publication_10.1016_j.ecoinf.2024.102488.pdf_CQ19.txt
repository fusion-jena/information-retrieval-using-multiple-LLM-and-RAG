4.1. Evaluation of fusion quality 

(1)  The  feature  dataset,  training  samples,  and  validation  samples 
were used as input into five base models to generate prediction 
results  (TKNN,  TRF,  TAdaBoost,  TXGBoost,  TLightGBM)  of  the  training 
samples  and  prediction  results  (VKNN,  VRF,  VAdaBoost,  VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM) of the validation samples.  

(2)  TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM  were combined in a 
column manner to obtain T, and VKNN, VRF, VAdaBoost, VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM were combined in a column manner to obtain V.  
(3)  Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the 
RF  algorithm  was  used  to  generate  the  prediction  results 
(α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of  training  data  T  by  5-fold  cross-validation. 
Stack (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) in rows to get A.

classification result B was obtained by voting.

3.3. Feature selection 

This study used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation 
(RFECV) to select the optimal features that could reduce the redundancy 
caused  by  multi-source  feature  datasets  and  improve  model  perfor-
mance. RFECV is a wraparound approach to feature selection based on

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) being employed in the study. These algorithms can be implemented using various programming languages and libraries, including Python with Scikit-learn, but no explicit mention of any deep learning framework is made in the provided context.
