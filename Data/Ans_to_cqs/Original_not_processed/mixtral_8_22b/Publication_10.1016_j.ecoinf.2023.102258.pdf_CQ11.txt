• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

Such fragmentation hinders the practical usability of deep learning 
in bioacoustics, and thus in the life sciences at large. Indeed to date, the 
success of deep neural networks in the supervised regime depends on the 
availability of a massive corpus of audio examples for the sound events 
of interest, paired with human annotations. Yet, temporally-precise and 
fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly 
and time-consuming. In many cases, the obstacle is not only to acquire 
annotations, but also the audio examples themselves: e.g. for rare spe-
cies,  remote  locations,  or  costly  equipment.  Furthermore,  these 
numerous small-data scenarios remain outside the scope of digital bio-
acoustic archives, such as Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library.

Query-time adaptation (transductive inference) was shown in mul-
tiple cases to lead to very strong performance, within both the proto-
typical  and  fine-tuning  paradigms.  This  comes  at  a  cost  of  added 
complexity  and  added  query-time  computation,  since  typically  a  new 
run of statistical optimisation must be performed for a new query task. 
Thus, from the present results we can recommend that a system should 
include query-time adaptation for the best possible detections, but that a 
system without query-time adaptation should be a widespread default. 
Such fixed embeddings can easily be used off-the-shelf, in the same way 
that  other  pretrained  networks  are  now  commonly  downloaded  and 
used.  The  DFSL  method  employed  by  Wu_SHNU  is  an  alternative 
approach  which  combines  an  unchanging  feature  extraction  with  a 
query-time  adaptive  weighting.  This  combines  stability  with  dynamic 
adaptation, and thus is worthy of further investigation.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference to a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two potential sources for audio examples and annotations: Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library. These resources could potentially contain relevant datasets for developing deep learning pipelines in bioacoustics. Unfortunately, no explicit links to these repositories or their respective deep learning pipelines are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot directly provide the requested data repository link.

To find the desired data repository link, one would need additional information about the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to. With this information, it may be possible to locate the corresponding dataset and associated code in a publicly accessible repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
