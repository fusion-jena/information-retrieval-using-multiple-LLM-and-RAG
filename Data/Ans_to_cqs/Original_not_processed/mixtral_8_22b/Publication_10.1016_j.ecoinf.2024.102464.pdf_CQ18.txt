Fig. 3. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of seven machine learning models. The true positive rate (sensitivity) of the vertical line and the false positive 
rate (1-specificity) of the horizontal line quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, respectively. The red and blue curves represent the 
mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to

Slope,  and  TWI),  and  distance  (distance  to  water,  distance  to  forests, 
distance to agricultural land, distance to grassland, distance to roads, 
and distance to urban areas) (Kwon, 2014; Song and Kim, 2012). We

a  landscape.  A  minimum  of  10  occupied  patches  in  the  study  area  is 
required to achieve accurate parameterization (Hanski et al., 2000). The 
method proposed in this study can overcome the limitations of the IFM 
model  because  it  analyzes  the  species  distribution  model  results, 
focusing on species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors conducted a correlation analysis of the variables before implementing the model to improve its predictive performance and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that they used variable selection techniques or dimensionality reduction methods to prevent multicollinearity among input features and reduce noise in the dataset. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies for monitoring the model performance during training, such as cross-validation, early stopping, or learning rate adjustments. Therefore, based solely on the given information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy employed by the researchers to monitor the model performance during training.
