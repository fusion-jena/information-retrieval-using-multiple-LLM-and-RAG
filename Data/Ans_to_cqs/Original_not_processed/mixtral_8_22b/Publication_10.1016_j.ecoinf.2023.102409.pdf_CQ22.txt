2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

Semantic segmentation involves two distinct sets of true labels and 
predicted values. Intersection over Union (IOU) metric determines the 
proportion of intersection to union between these two sets (Wang et al., 
2022a;  Yu  et  al., 2019). MIoU  computes  IOU  for  each  category  sepa-
rately and then averages the results across all categories (Garcia-Garcia 
et al., 2017). MPA assesses the accuracy of pixel-level categorization by 
measuring the ratio of correctly categorized pixels to the total number of 
pixels  (Li  et  al.,  2023b).  Accuracy  represents  the  proportion  of  accu-
rately  predicted  data  points  from  the  whole  dataset  (Li  et  al.,  2022). 
Precision  ranges  between  0  and  1,  with  values  closer  to  1  indicating 
better discrimination between negative samples. Recall also ranges be-
tween 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of 
positive  samples.  F1  score,  ranging  from  0  to  1,  reflects  the  model’s

(3) Deeplabv3þ. In the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model, the 
backbone  network  is  replaced  with  Mobilenetv2  featuring  expanded 
convolution (Fig. 5). Mobilenetv2 network ensures higher accuracy and 
enhances  the  model’s  lightweight  nature  compared  to  the  originally 
used  Xception+ network  (Fu  et  al.,  2022),  significantly  reducing  the 
model weights file size and accelerating model prediction speed. Addi-
tionally,  the  semantic  segmentation  task  involves  incorporating  ASPP 
module into the encoder-decoder network (Chen et al., 2018b). Five sets 
of feature maps are obtained by utilizing four atrous convolution blocks 
with varied dilation rates (including convolution, batch normalization, 
and activation layers) and a global average pooling block. These feature 
maps are concatenated, then passed through a 1 × 1 convolution block, 
and  ultimately  inputted  into  the  Decoder  module.  ASPP  method  in-

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean IoU (MIoU), Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and actual bounding boxes, while MIoU calculates the mean IoU for each class separately and then averages them. MPA evaluates the accuracy of pixel-level classification by measuring the ratio of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. Accuracy represents the proportion of accurately predicted data points from the entire dataset. Precision ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better discrimination between negative samples. Recall also ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of positive samples. The F1 score, which ranges from 0 to 1, reflects the model's robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.
