Data availability 

The deep learning and post-processing scripts along with the 2012 
aerial  imagery  and  data  output  used  in  this  study  can  be  found  at

et al., 2023; Hodgson et al., 2018; Ventura et al., 2018). These two deep 
learning approaches require initial ground-truth datasets consisting of 
annotated images, which are used to train a model that iteratively im-
proves  by  evaluating  its  output  against the  provided  annotations  and 
adjusting its parameters to match the desired output. Once trained, the 
models can be applied to new datasets for automatic classification, of-
fering  flexibility  and  power  by  learning  directly  from  image  output. 
Recent advancements in open-source user frameworks have made deep 
learning more accessible (Christin et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2019; Perry 
et al., 2022). With this study, we aim to further stimulate the uptake of 
deep  learning  techniques  in  ecology  and  conservation  by  providing 
open-access scripts that can be adapted to various ecosystems, including 
challenging coastal environments.

By providing the tools to conduct these analyses, we aim to stimulate the uptake of deep learning for enhancing 
the data obtained from aerial imagery to improve the monitoring and conservation of natural ecosystems.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses aerial imagery and provides a link to the Git repository where the data and code can be accessed. It also states that the deep learning models were trained using annotated images, but no details about the nature or source of those images are given. Therefore, without accessing the linked Git repository, it is impossible to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
