The batch size was 32, and the early stopping procedure was used to 
avoid over-fitting. The patience parameter, which controls the number 
of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, was set to 10. 
Each network, with a particular architecture and considering a specific 
substratum characterization, was trained and executed three times, each 
time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters 
and with a different data fold. As already mentioned, the results shown 
in  the  next  section  are  averages  of  those  three  executions.  Data 
augmentation was applied to all extracted patches: a 90∘  rotation and 
vertical and horizontal flips.

Appendix A. Network architectures 

The network architectures of the models evaluated in the experiments are described in detail in Fig. 9. The light green areas in that figure represent 
feature extractor modules based on the different architectures, i.e., VGG, ResNet, and Xception. The orange area represents the architecture of the 
classifier module, to which the outputs of each feature extractor are submitted.

Each rectangle indicates the operations performed at a block of layers. Conv and SConv stand for regular convolution and depth-wise separable 
convolution, respectively. The values that follow such operations indicate the number of filters, filter size, stride, and dilation rate. Regarding the 
maxpooling operation, the values correspond to the kernel dimension and stride. Dropout refers to the number of neurons randomly turned off during 
each training inference. The number of neurons in the dense layer of the classifier module corresponds to the number of classes in the dataset. 

All architectures were modified mainly in the block of fully connected layers, where we opted to use just the output layer after the feature extractor 
instead of two fully connected layers. Additionally, residual blocks were used at the architectures’ stems rather than in the full feature extractor. All 
those modifications were experimentally determined.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what postprocessing steps were taken after the model training. However, there are some clues that can help infer possible postprocessing steps.

Firstly, the performance metrics section suggests that the authors calculated various metrics to evaluate their models. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other relevant metric depending on the problem domain. Therefore, one postprocessing step would be calculating these performance metrics using the test datasets.

Secondly, the table containing the results shows average scores from three executions of each network. This implies that the authors ran multiple trials of each model and then took the average of the results. This process could involve creating confusion matrices for each trial and then aggregating them to calculate overall performance metrics.

Lastly, while not directly related to postprocessing, the mention of saliency maps in the paper's title suggests that they may have been used to visualize the features learned by the models. Saliency maps highlight the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. They can provide insights into how well the model has learned to focus on important features and can also aid in debugging if the model is making incorrect predictions.

In summary, although the exact postprocessing steps are not specified, it can be inferred that the authors likely calculated performance metrics, created confusion matrices, and possibly generated saliency maps to evaluate and interpret their models.
