Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some references mentioned in the table might provide insights into potential methods. For instance, Guo et al. (2023) discuss construction of 3D landscape indexes based on oblique photogrammetry, which suggests that they may have collected data through remote sensing techniques or imagery analysis. Additionally, Ho (2023) mentions analyzing visual landscape elements, possibly indicating the use of image processing or computer vision techniques. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding the data collection process, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
