2.2. Machine learning and deep learning tools 

In the present study machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree) 
and deep learning (artificial neural network) models were employed to 
forecast  the  percent  disease  incidence  of  CLCuD  under  the  prevailing 
weather data on minimum, maximum and average temperature, stan-
dard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (henceforth 
mentioned  as  GDD),  minimum  relative  humidity  (RHmini.),  maximum 
relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumu-
lative rainfall (mm) and whitefly per three leaves. The weather param-
eters recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four 
locations  were  used  for  calculating  the  GDD  as  per  the  following 
equations.

3.5. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP): artificial neural network 

training  = 0.80 and R2

including multiple linear regression, machine learning (bootstrap forest, 
boosted tree), and deep learning (ANN) models through statistical and 
machine learning methods and compare them for prediction accuracy. 
The ultimate aim was to develop a holistic model with better accuracy 
and reliability for the prediction of CLCuD which ultimately can help 
timely application of management decisions in the prevailing climatic 
conditions.

Nowadays, machine learning and the artificial neural network (ANN) 
computational technique are emerging tools which has put forth a va-
riety  of  remarkable  advancements  in  algorithms  and  processing  tech-
niques. These techniques have been capable of developing models for 
accurate  prediction  utilizing  correlation  patterns  between  input  and 
output datasets, and have been utilized to solve problems in biological 
sciences  (Haykin,  1994;  Kolay  and  Baser,  2014;  Lashkarblooki  et  al., 
2012; Tufail et al., 2008; Yilmaz and Kaynar, 2011). Some researchers 
have  used  image  analysis  with  machine  learning  (ML),  deep  learning 
(DL) and model combination (MC) techniques to identify, monitor and 
estimate plant disease severity under field conditions (Alves et al., 2022; 
Mzoughi  and  Yahiaoui,  2023;  Singh  et  al.,  2022,  2023).  Moreover, 
Revathi and Hemalatha (2014) and Caldeira et al. (2021) have used ML

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and others. These techniques are used to minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. Without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques used in this study.
