Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

The basic models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strat-
egy based on fine-tuning. The model parameters were initialized using a 
pre-trained model. The final classification layer was then replaced by a 
fully connected layer, aligning its output dimension with the number of 
classes  in  the  target  dataset.  Subsequently,  all  parameters  across  the 
layers were fine-tuned on the target dataset. The basic models in all the 

The  performances  of  the  four  basic  models  and  two  proposed 
ensemble  methods  on  the  IP102  dataset  are  lised  in  Table  2.  The 
parameter  sizes  of  the  four  basic  models  were  comparable,  with 
approximately 24 M parameters for each model. However, there was a 
significant variation in the performances of the basic models, as shown 
in Table 2. ViP-Small/7 exhibited the lowest performance, whereas the 
two  transformer-like  models  demonstrated  better  performance,  with 
Volo-d1 achieving the highest performance.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The most common approach is to use a random sampling method to ensure that each subset has a representative sample from the entire dataset. The ratio of splitting the data depends on various factors such as the total amount of available data, class distribution, and computational resources. Commonly used ratios include 80:20, 70:30, or 60:20:20 for training, testing, and validation sets, respectively. In some cases, more sophisticated techniques like k-fold cross-validation may also be employed to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model.
