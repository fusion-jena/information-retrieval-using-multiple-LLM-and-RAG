While building the RF model, the training samples were randomly 
divided  according  to  proportions  of  80%  and  20%  and  used  for  the 
training and test datasets, respectively. The parameters of the RF model, 
number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and 
number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features) 
significantly affected  the  accuracy and  complexity  of  the model.  This 
study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag 
(OOB)  error  and  five-fold  cross-validation  to  search  for  the  optimal 
parameters  of  the  model  (Chang  et  al.,  2023).  The  n_estimators  were 
spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is 2, 5, 10, 
20, and 50. The max_features were spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 
1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.

Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox uses data from multiple 
reflection  bands,  observation  zenith  angles,  solar  zenith  angles,  and 
body relative direction angles and estimates the LAI using PROSAIL and 
a  neural  network  algorithm  (Weiss  and  Baret,  2016).  There  are  inte-
grated modules for Sentinel 2 satellite data. The LAI generated by the 
SL2P  was  used  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  the  estimated  results.  In 
addition,  Sentinel-2A  images  were  resampled  to  30  m,  providing  the 
estimation  data  for  high-resolution  LAI.  Based  on  the  geographical 
location  of  the  research  area,  the  spatial  projection  of  the  data  was 
uniformly transformed into WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_48N.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to find the optimal parameters of the model. These methods can be used to optimize hyperparameters and improve the overall performance of the model. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. But without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which ones were used in this particular case.
