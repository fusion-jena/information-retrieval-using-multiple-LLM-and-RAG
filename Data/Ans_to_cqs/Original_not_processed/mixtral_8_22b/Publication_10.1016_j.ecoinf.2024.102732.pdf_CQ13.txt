parameter combination, enhancing the model’s performance. Important
indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include “Gain” and
“Frequency” (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Meh-
mood et al., 2024a; Ryu et al., 2020). SVR tuning involves selecting the
appropriate kernel function and optimizing the “C” parameter, which
balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of
SVR allows it
to handle complex decision boundaries effectively
(Yudong Li et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015).

2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

specifically a max_depth value of 7 and an eta value of 0.3. Out of the
models that were assessed, it was found that the RF model exhibited the
most superior predictive capability. The model demonstrated a strong fit
to the data, as evidenced by R-squared values of 0.66, 0.70, and 0.81.
The RF model showed exceptional error reduction performance, as seen
by an RMAE of 14.33% and RRMSE of 22.23%. The hyperparameters,
namely max_depth = 25, n_estimators = 1000, and mtry = 1,3,7, were
optimized to attain the observed level of performance in each of the
three combinations.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the use of a deep learning model or its specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer in the given context. The text primarily discusses the optimization and performance evaluation of Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models. It mentions important indices like "Gain" and "Frequency" for measuring variable importance in XGBoost and "Percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" for evaluating variable importance in RF. Additionally, key parameters for tuning XGBoost, including "nrounds," "max depth," "min child weight," "gamma," and "subsample," are mentioned. However, none of this information pertains directly to a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
