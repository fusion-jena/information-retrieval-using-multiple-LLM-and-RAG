3.4. Impact of data split 

This  section  illustrates  the  impact  of  the  data  split  (i.e.,  test  and 
training data ratio) on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. By eval-
uating  the  classification  results  of  the  proposed  model  with  different 
training data, we will better understand the required amount of data to 
reach  an  acceptable  wetland  accuracy  level.  This  is  significant  when 
there is a limited number of reference data in a project. We utilized a 

different ratio of training data from reference data. The training ratio 
started from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%. Based on the results, as the 
amount of data gradually increased, the classification accuracy of our 
method was improved. This improvement was substantial for increasing 
the  training  ratio  from  10%  to  30%  (average  accuracy  improved  by 
17.47%).  However,  average  accuracy  just  increased  by  7.01%  by 
increasing the training ratio from 30% to 90% (see Fig. 10).

Many  ecosystems,  particularly  wetlands,  are  significantly  degraded  or  lost  as  a  result  of  climate  change  and 
anthropogenic  activities.  Simultaneously,  developments  in  machine  learning,  particularly  deep  learning 
methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present 
deep  and  very deep  models necessitate  a greater  number  of  training data, which  are costly,  logistically  chal-
lenging,  and  time-consuming  to  acquire.  Thus,  we  explore  and  address  the  potential  and  possible  limitations 
caused  by  the  availability  of  limited  ground-truth  data  for  large-scale  wetland  mapping.  To  overcome  this 
persistent  problem  for  remote  sensing  data  classification  using  deep  learning  models,  we  propose  3D  UNet 
Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they do discuss evaluating the performance of their proposed model with varying amounts of training data to determine the minimum amount needed to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy. They also use multiple types of transformers and compare them against each other and existing methods. Additionally, they evaluate their method across several classes including Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, Shallow water, Deep water, and Upland. These steps suggest that some effort has been made to improve the robustness and applicability of their approach.
