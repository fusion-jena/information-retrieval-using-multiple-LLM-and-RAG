To achieve the utmost accuracy, a test was completed by engaging 
the artificial ANN. Only Cb and Cr were used as the input variables since 
they were considered the most sensitive variables during the two pre-
ceding testing stages. Thus, the simple ANN was fitted with two inputs 
and one output, as the addition of any hidden layers returned less ac-
curacy of the prediction on the test data due to overfitting. The results 
were  considered  comparable  in  terms  of  accuracy  as  the  previous 
methods. The mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value 
measurements  was  1.904  (95%  CI:  1.89–1.92),  while  the  best  “run” 
showed a mean deviation of 1.70 (max. 2.22, 95% CI, one-sided t-test). 
All three modelling approaches could be incorporated in the source 
code at this stage to provide the SPAD value estimate for the following 
rapeseed measurements. However, LM was concluded to be the simplest 
method with a high level of accuracy. A complex overview of the plant

value gained by SPAD-502Plus (Fig. 6). Furthermore, modelling of the 
SPAD  value  was  performed  by  a)  a  simple  linear  model  (LM),  b)  a 
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and c) an 
artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset contained 89 valid records 
(outliers were removed according to the empirical rule), while one re-
cord represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on 
one  leaf.  For  the  purpose  of  SPAD  value  modelling,  the  dataset  was 
divided  into  a  “training  dataset”  containing  60  randomly  selected  re-
cords and a “testing dataset” that contained the remaining 29 records. 
All three models were then fitted using the “training dataset” and further 
validated using the “testing dataset”.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved dividing the dataset into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" that contained the remaining 29 records. All three models, including the simple linear model (LM), generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN), were then fitted using the "training dataset" and further validated using the "testing dataset". This allowed for monitoring the performance of each model during training and assessing their predictive capabilities on unseen data. Additionally, statistical measures such as R-squared values and mean absolute differences were calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit and accuracy of the models.
