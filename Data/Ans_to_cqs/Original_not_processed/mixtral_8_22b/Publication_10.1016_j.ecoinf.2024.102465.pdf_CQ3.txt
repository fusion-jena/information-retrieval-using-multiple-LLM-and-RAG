The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

The study collected relevant reviews with images from the Weibo, 
Dianping, and Ctrip platforms for 57 traditional villages, respectively. 
After  cleaning  and  removing  irrelevant  data,  3694  social  media  data 
entries with photographs were obtained. The NLP model scores the text 
content in the valid data on a scale of 10 to (cid:0) 10, and the final average 
value for each traditional village is calculated. Higher values indicate 
more favorable sentiments.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study primarily uses semantic segmentation as a data annotation technique in their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they employ the HRNet model for this purpose. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label or category to every pixel in an image, thus allowing for the identification and classification of objects within the image. This technique differs from bounding box annotation, which only identifies the general location of an object within an image, and instance segmentation, which not only classifies pixels but also distinguishes between individual instances of the same class within an image. However, the specific details regarding how the semantic segmentation is performed, such as whether it is done manually or automatically, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
