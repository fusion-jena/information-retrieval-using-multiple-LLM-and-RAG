Feature extraction model selection is evaluated in Section 4.1.

samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

amount of data required to infer reliable and ecologically meaningful

We compare three classification models - ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016),
Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) and HuBERT
(Hsu et al., 2021). The classification models compared in Section 4.1
were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments automatically
generated by the annotator. The dataset includes 1130 possum vocal-
isations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset has an 80/20% training-
validation split which is used to evaluate model performance during
training. Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the
recommendation outlined by the model authors. Each segment has been
manually reviewed by a human. 500 segments are separated into a test
set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The
distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of
the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset
performance are reported. Using the test dataset we evaluate the model

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been taken. Firstly, the dataset used for training consists of 3000 5s segments, including both possum vocalizations and noise sources. This diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to handle various types of input. Secondly, the dataset was divided into an 80/20% training-validation split, allowing for evaluation of the model's performance during training. Thirdly, the distribution of target features to non-target features in the test dataset is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation. This ensures that the model can accurately classify new, unseen data. Lastly, both validation and test dataset performances are reported, providing insight into how well the model performs on different sets of data. These measures help ensure that the deep learning model is robust and capable of handling real-world scenarios.
