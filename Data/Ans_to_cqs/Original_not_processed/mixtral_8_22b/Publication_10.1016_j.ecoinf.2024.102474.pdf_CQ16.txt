3. Results 

3.1. Model training efficiency 

Model  training  on  our  hardware  (NVIDIA  GTX  1080  GPU)  took 
~460  h.  The  optimization  was  stopped  once  the  validation  ENS 
repeatedly  failed  to  improve  compared  to  the  score  evaluated  from 
previous  epochs.  The  model  at  the  epoch  with  the  highest  attained 
validation  score  was  selected.  We  noted  a  significant  acceleration  of 
convergence  when  employing  the  baseline  framework,  as  shown  in

2.2. Data 

The data used here was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Chal-
lenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe

The training efficiency gain was most clearly expressed for the MAD 
(Fig. 4a), indicating the benefit of providing the baseline for the model 
to  predict  accurate  average  reflectances  across  scenes.  The  SGED-
ConvLSTM tended to improve more rapidly on the validation score with 
an  increasing  number  of  training  epochs  than  the  SGConvLSTM,  but 
started at a lower initial score. Nonetheless, SGEDConvLSTM reached its 
validation  score  plateau  considerably  sooner  (after  44  epochs)  than 
SGConvLSTM.  SGConvLSTM  continued  to  improve  on  its  validation 
score and reached its validation score plateau after 92 epochs at a higher 
final ENS than SGEDConvLSTM.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation EarthNetScore (ENS). Training is stopped once the validation ENS repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score is then selected. This indicates that the model has converged and further training would not significantly improve performance.
