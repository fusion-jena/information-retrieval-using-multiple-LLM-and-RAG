field-collected data and machine learning methods on developing AGB 
models.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  training  samples  and  the  layout  of 
sampling  points  are  crucial  for  constructing  accurate  and  reliable 
models for biomass estimation (Morais et al., 2021). In this study, owing 
to  the  insufficiency  of  high-quality  training  samples,  we  employed  a 
method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data 
with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

In  this  study,  we  adopt  the  vegetation  type  information  from  the 
vegetation map of China (1:4000000), provided by the National Cryo-
sphere  Desert  Data  Center  (http://www.ncdc.ac.cn,  accessed  on  11 
November 2022). This map serves as a vegetation status map, encom-
passing detailed classifications of 141 types of vegetation (Hou et al., 
2019). The natural vegetation consists of eight major vegetation groups: 
coniferous forest, mixed forest, broadleaf forest, shrubland, grassland, 
meadow, and alpine vegetation. The map provides detailed and accurate 
vegetation map at national scale. Considering that our biomass estima-
tion was conducted at a 1 km grid scale, we converted the vector forest 
type data into 1 km × 1 km grids to match the biomass estimation. When 
converting  vector  polygons  to  raster  grids,  the  grids  that  are  entirely 
contained within the polygon belong to a specific type. For grids at the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of forest inventory data and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline could include images or satellite data, which is often used in remote sensing applications. Additionally, the text refers to the use of field-collected data, which might suggest the use of structured data such as CSV files. However, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline.
