Since the multi-class (i.e. 10 classes) semantic segmentation problem 
is quite complex, the set of 290 training images was found to be insuf-
ficient to obtain satisfactory results, even with the use of the transfer 
learning framework. Therefore, we employed data augmentation stra-
tegies to increase the training set size fourfold: horizontal flip, Gaussian 
noise  addition,  and  contrast  reduction.  The  first  two  augmentation 
strategies are fairly common. The contrast reduction strategy was spe-
cifically motivated by our application, namely given that we expect the 
images  to  contain  shadows  occluding  the  vegetation  types,  contrast 
reduction helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected 
in the dataset.

(CK). Manual classification of fuel types used 
in  semantic  segmentation  training  and 
testing were limited to data collected at PM 
and  CL.  Field  measurement  data  and  raw 
photos  from  the  CK  field  site  were  used 
solely for independent validation. R refers to

our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

when  comparing  forb  and  grass  cover  measurements  from  photos  to 
corresponding  field-based  measurements,  but  this  is  likely  due  to  the 
influence  of  outliers.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  algorithm  was  trained 
with a small set of images (n = 290), which necessitated the use of data 
augmentation strategies to increase the number of training images, but 
likely at the cost of reduced flexibility and robustness for applying the 
trained network in new situations. We expect that training the network 
with a larger set of images taken at different sites would greatly improve 
the algorithm’s performance in new locations.

Helpful Answer:
The authors have implemented several data augmentation strategies to address the complexity of their multi-class semantic segmentation task and the lack of sufficient training images. These strategies include horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise, and reducing contrast. Horizontal flipping is a commonly used technique where images are mirrored along the vertical axis, effectively doubling the amount of available training data. Adding Gaussian noise involves introducing random pixel values drawn from a normal distribution, helping the model generalize better to noisy input. Lastly, reducing contrast specifically targets the issue of shadow occlusion on vegetation types, making the model more resilient to variations in lighting conditions.
