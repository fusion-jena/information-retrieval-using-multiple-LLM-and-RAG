et al., 2016), and LightGBM 3.2.1 (Ke et al., 2017) libraries. In building a 
machine  learning  model,  the  structure  and  hyperparameters  of  the 
model must be determined, such as the number of decision trees and the 
depth of trees for RF models and the number of intermediate layers and 
nodes for ANN models. We optimized the structure and hyperparameters 
of the RF and ANN models using Optuna 2.10.0 (Akiba et al., 2019) with 
the  parameters  and  ranges  shown  in  Table  1  as  candidates.  For  the 
LightGBM models, we used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integra-
tion.lightgbm)  for hyperparameter  fitting.  The  performance of  the  al-
gorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared 
error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute 
error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated 
for reference.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository hosting service.
