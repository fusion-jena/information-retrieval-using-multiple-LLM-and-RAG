Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

2.5. Description of hyperparameters and training aspects 

The  five  detection  models  were  trained  using  a  manually  labeled 
image dataset for alate detection. After conducted initial computational 
experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400 and 500 
with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, it was determined that the optimal 
hyperparameters for our training were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8 
and were constant when comparing the five detection models using 640 
× 640, and 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolutions on each model type. 
The batch defines the number of samples to be worked through before 
moving on to update the internal model parameters (Radiuk, 2017). The 
epoch  number  used  in  training  determines  the  number  of  times  the 
detection model processes the dataset dedicated to training the model 
(Brownlee,  2018).  The  computer  infrastructure  used  for  training

using  the  Common  Objects  in  Context  (COCO)  dataset  for  training

extra-large,  the  file  size  and  processing  time  increases  (Ultralytics, 
2023).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and others are often used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, without explicit mention of these techniques being used in this particular study, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
