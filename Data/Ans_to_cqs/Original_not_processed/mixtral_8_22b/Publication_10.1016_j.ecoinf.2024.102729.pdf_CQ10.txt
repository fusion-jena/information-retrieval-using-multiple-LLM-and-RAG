Commonly used correlation analysis methods, such as the Pearson correlation, cannot accurately 

capture  these  complex  relationships.  To  address  this  deficiency,  MIC  analysis  is  often 

recommended  to  detect  both  linear  and  nonlinear  associations  between  two  variables  in  large 

datasets  (Reshef  et  al.,  2011).  MIC  has  been  extensively  used  to  select  candidate  predictors  for 

machine learning models (Su et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023;

Yao et al., 2023). MIC ranges from 0 to 1. The stronger the correlation between two variables, the 

larger the MIC value is. MIC scores greater than 0.3 between any given environmental factor and
