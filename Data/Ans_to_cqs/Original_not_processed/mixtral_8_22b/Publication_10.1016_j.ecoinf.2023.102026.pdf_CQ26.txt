Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To produce accurate SDMs, not just the effects of different algorithms 
should be investigated, but also the effects of resampling techniques on 
model's  training  data  (Efron,  1982;  Freedman,  1981).  Specifically, 
bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement) the training 
data  has  been  shown  to  increase  models'  precision  by  providing  a 
combination of models, which reduces stochastic errors in estimation (e. 
g., Vaughan and Ormerod (2005); Hefley et al. (2014); Xu and Goodacre 
(2018)).

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  (RF;  Breiman 
(2001)) is the most commonly used algorithm (Stupariu et al., 2021). RF 
are  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART)  based  ensemble  ap-
proaches,  which  overcome  limitations  of  CARTs  such  as  model  over- 
fitting.  Additionally,  RF  can  handle  large  numbers  of  predictor  vari-
ables  without  being  affected  by  multicollinearity,  and  can  readily 
accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response 
variables  (Breiman,  2001;  Evans  and  Cushman,  2009;  Kumar  et  al., 
2021). Furthermore, by permutation of variables, RF provides accessible 
measures of variable importance (Cutler et al., 2007; Evans and Cush-
man, 2009).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions bootstrapping, a technique involving random subsampling with replacement, which can help improve models' precision by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. Bootstrapping is applied to the training data, creating a combination of models that can lead to more accurate results. Although this method is not explicitly mentioned as a solution for data bias, it could potentially contribute to mitigating some forms of bias by introducing randomness into the sampling process. Nonetheless, other methods like those listed in the query would still need to be considered when dealing specifically with data bias issues.
