Batch normalization and dropout layers were adopted to assist in the 
feature extraction of the convolutional layers. The feature generalization 
of  the  input  mini-batch  was  performed  by  calculating  the  mean  and 
standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate 
shifts  (Cooijmans  et  al.,  2016).  Overfitting  of  the  CNN  model  was 
reduced  using  a  dropout  layer  that  inactivates  random  nodes  that 
contain learnable weights (Ashiquzzaman et al., 2018). Fully connected 
layers  obtain  processed  features  using  convolutional  operations  for 
classification  or  regression  tasks.  CNN  model  training  adjusts  the 
weights  by  conducting  backpropagation,  whereas  the  loss  function 
minimizes  the  error between  the observed and  estimated results.  The 
gradient  descent  algorithm  iteratively  updates  kernel  weights  by 
calculating the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each

discriminative  features  from  an  autoencoder  can  drive  the  effective 
feature learning of a deep learning model. Static information in the input 
data  may  aggravate  the  learning  process  of  the  CNN  model  (Ibrahim 
et al., 2021). Beissinger (2018) decoupled the representation of a static 
input  to  extract  complicated  feature  data  efficiently  using  an  autoen-
coder. Many previous studies have reproduced manifold features from 
both dynamic and static inputs using an autoencoder to overcome the 
demerits  of  exacerbated  data  composition  in  deep  learning  training 
(Ibrahim et al., 2021; Xia and Liu, 2013; Zhai et al., 2016). However, 
enhancing the accuracy of estimating or classifying aquatic ecosystem 
health remains challenging. Lee et al. (2021) achieved the best perfor-
mance in classifying health indices, including F1 scores of 0.35, 0.53, 
and 0.61 in terms of TDI, BMI, and FAI, respectively. Woo et al. (2019)

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details on addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two techniques used in the deep learning pipeline to improve feature extraction and reduce overfitting: batch normalization and dropout layers.

Batch normalization is used to perform feature generalization of the input mini-batch by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the batch normalization layer. This helps avoid covariate shifts and improves the performance of the deep learning model. Dropout layers are employed to reduce overfitting by randomly inactivating nodes containing learnable weights. These techniques help enhance the overall performance of the deep learning model but do not directly address data bias during preprocessing.

To specifically tackle data bias during preprocessing, one could consider employing various strategies like stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes in both the train and test sets remain similar to the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can be applied to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Additionally, collecting diverse data can also aid in reducing data bias and improving the robustness of the deep learning model.
