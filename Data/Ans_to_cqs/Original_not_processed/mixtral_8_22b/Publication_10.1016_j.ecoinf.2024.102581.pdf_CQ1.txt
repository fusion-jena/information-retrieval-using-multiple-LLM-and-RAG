hyperparameters.  The  hyperparameters  with  the  current  results  are 
saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the 
proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. 
After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides 
us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN. 
The  overall  complexity  is  dominated  by  the  iterations,  “TC”,  and 
within  each  iteration,  the  operations  depend  on  the  population  size 
“NP”.  Therefore,  the  total  complexity  can  be  approximated  as 
O(TC*NP).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a dataset called CVIP100 for plant leaf classification. This suggests that one possible method for gathering raw data could involve using publicly available datasets like CVIP100 or other similar databases. Additionally, the paper mentions various studies that have employed different types of deep learning models such as DDYOLOv5, ResNet-50, Deep Attention Dense CNN, and dense convolutional neural networks for tasks related to image classification. These models typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which may come from sources such as online repositories, sensor readings, or manual labeling efforts. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data aren't specified within this context, some potential approaches include utilizing existing datasets, leveraging sensor technology, or manually curating labeled examples.
