5.5. Discussion

Recent years have seen increasing concerns about protecting the privacy of conﬁdential
information when processing data using models. This leads to the need for cryptographic
techniques to solve privacy concerns in data-driven models. Several PPDL techniques have
been proposed in the literature to solve these concerns. This research is, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst work that investigates PPDL for satellite image classiﬁcation.

The considered dataset is further divided into three datasets, resulting in 22,666 images
for training the model (training set), 7554 images for validating the trained model (valida-
tion set), and 7554 images for assessing the model performance (testing set).

To obtain this dataset, a semantic segmentation is conducted using our previous
works [51–53]. The four classes—namely, urban, bare soil, vegetation and road—are
extracted from the satellite images, meaning that the resulting images each contain both
the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes.
Then, each image containing a given class is divided into non-overlapping blocks of
256 × 256 pixels and saved into folders, each with the name of the corresponding class. A
sample of this dataset is depicted in Figure 4, wherein the white represents a given land
cover class and the black represents the values of other classes.

5.2. Experimental Set-Up

•

•

Case 1: Training and testing the proposed CNN model with unencrypted data. The
results from training the model with plain data achieved 96.91% and 96.84% accuracy
for training and validation, respectively, on the training dataset, as well as 93.84%
accuracy for the testing dataset. Figure 7 demonstrates the accuracy results for training
and validating the CNN model over plain satellite images.
Case 2: Training and testing the proposed CNN model over encrypted data. The
results of training the model on encrypted data achieved 94.04% and 94.30% accuracy
for training and validation, respectively, on the training dataset, as well as 90.92%
accuracy for the testing dataset. Figure 8 demonstrates the accuracy results for training
and validating the CNN model on encrypted satellite images.

Helpful Answer:
The considered dataset was divided into three datasets for different purposes in the deep learning model training process. The first dataset contained 22,666 images used for training the model (training set). The second dataset consisted of 7,554 images utilized for validating the trained model (validation set). Lastly, the third dataset included another 7,554 images employed for evaluating the model's performance (testing set). These divisions allowed for proper assessment and optimization of the model during its development and ensured reliable evaluation of its final performance.
