During  the  campaign,  methods  are  proposed  to  assess  inter- 
annotator  variability  and  aggregate  annotation  sets.  Those  methods 
will help to define the minimal number of annotators needed [Dubus 
et al., 2023; Walter et al., 2022]. Increasing the number of annotators 
per sample could be helpful if the variability is too high. Finally, the two 
grouping  methods:  majority  voting  (Section  2.2.3)  and  soft  labeling 
(Section 2.3.2) can also be used to produce relevant annotation sets for 
deep learning. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study, new approaches were explored to improve the accuracy 
and  efficiency  of  cetacean  vocalization  detection  using  deep  learning 
models. Leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert 
and novice annotators aimed to address the challenges associated with 
the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater PAM studies.

distinctive  annotation  profiles  influenced  by  the  complexity  of  vocalizations  and  the  annotators’  strategies, 
ranging from conservative to permissive. To address the challenges of annotation discrepancies, Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and the expert. The results show varia-
tions in model performance. Our work highlights the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more 
conservative  approach  to  improve  overall  annotation  quality.  In  an  effort  to  optimize  the  potential  of  multi- 
annotation  and  mitigate  the  presence  of  noisy  labels,  two  annotation  aggregation  methods  (majority  voting 
and  soft  labeling)  are  proposed  and  tested.  The  results  demonstrate  that  both  methods,  particularly  when  a 
sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability:

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  CNNs  trained  on  different 
annotation sets, datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and 
blue whale’s Dcall were chosen. Only a small portion of those datasets 
were used to reduce computational time, as hundreds of networks were 
trained and compared. 

For the evaluation of the SEIO PBW vocalizations, 7 h of audio sig-
nals recorded during the OHASISBIO program were used [Royer, 2009; 
Torterotot et al., 2020]. These recordings were collected at the SWAMS 
site, located in the Indian Ocean’s oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and 
Amsterdam Island. This dataset is called SWAMS in this paper. The re-
cordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a 
depth of 1000 m. The sampling rate was 240 Hz. A total of 102 vocali-
zations were manually annotated by a second expert.

However,  it  has  been  observed  that  annotation  sets  used  to  train 
models qualified as “permissive annotators” get lower performance than 
the ones qualified as “conservative annotators”  even with comparable 
F1 score with the annotations from the experts. Gu et al. (2023) also 
proposed that at the same ratio of noise on the training set, the model’s 
performance can decrease differently regarding the type of noise. In this 
study,  it  seems  that  simple  convolutional  neural  network  models 
generalize better from the most obvious examples and the introduction 
of false positives deteriorates the performance more than the omission of 
a vocalization in the annotation set. For future annotation campaigns, 
this  result  might  suggest  that  instructing  annotators  to  adopt  a  more 
conservative approach could be beneficial.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it discusses various aspects related to improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models.

The text mentions leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. It further explores distinctive annotation profiles influenced by the complexity of vocalizations and the annotators' strategies, ranging from conservative to permissive.

To handle annotation discrepancies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and experts. The results indicate variations in model performance. Two annotation aggregation methods – majority voting and soft labeling – are proposed and tested to optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels. Both methods, especially when a sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability.

The conclusion states that evaluating the performance of CNNs trained on different annotation sets involves using datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale’s Dcalls. However, only a small portion of these datasets is utilized due to computational constraints.

While the context provides valuable insights into addressing challenges in cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques like SGD or Adam employed within the deep learning pipeline.
