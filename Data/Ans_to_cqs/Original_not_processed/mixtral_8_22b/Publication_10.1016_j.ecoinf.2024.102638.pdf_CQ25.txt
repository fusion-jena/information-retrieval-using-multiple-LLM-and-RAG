The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

XGB  optimises  predictive  modelling  through  gradient  boosting  and 
regularisation (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). SVR uses kernel functions to 
efficiently handle non-linear data by fitting the best hyperplane within a 
pre-defined  error  margin  (Hsu  et  al.,  2003).  MLP  is  a  feed-forward 
neural network that learns complex patterns using adjustable weights 
and activation functions (Kingma and Ba, 2014).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper proposes several machine learning models including XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. However, it does not explicitly state the specific task or purpose of these deep learning models. Based on the information given, we can infer that these models are likely being used for regression tasks due to their application in predictive modeling and the use of negative mean squared error as a target measure during hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the mention of kernel functions in relation to SVR suggests that they may be handling non-linear data. Overall, without more explicit context regarding the intended purpose of each model, we cannot definitively determine whether they are being used for classification, segmentation, detection, or another type of task.
