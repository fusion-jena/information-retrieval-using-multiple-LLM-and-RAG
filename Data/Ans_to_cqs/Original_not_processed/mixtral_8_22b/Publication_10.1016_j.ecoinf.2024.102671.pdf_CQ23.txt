5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).

Secondly, the main challenge of the study lies in employing a more 
refined  cross-validation  approach  that  should  incorporate  temporal, 
spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological data. Effective 
cross-validation  is  essential  for  assessing  the  generalizability  and 
robustness of ecological zoning models (Roberts et al., 2017). The future 
study could focus on using statistical and machine learning techniques to 
model the relationship between landscape features and ecological car-
bon  sink capabilities. Implement cross-validation  techniques to  assess 
the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method. 

Lastly,  this  study  did  not  fully  reflect  the  dynamic  changes  in 
ecosystem and ecological carbon sink states. Considering the dynamism

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning model or its application in the given context. However, there is a reference to the use of cross-validation techniques for assessing the predictive accuracy and robustness of ecological zoning methods. This suggests that the authors acknowledge the importance of ensuring the generalizability of their models. While the details regarding the implementation of these cross-validation techniques are not mentioned, they can be used to validate the performance of various types of models, including deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into training and testing sets multiple times, allowing the model to learn from different subsets of the data and providing a more accurate estimate of its performance on unseen data. In summary, although the text does not directly address the use of diverse datasets or stratified splitting, it does indicate the use of cross-validation techniques to enhance the generalizability of the ecological zoning methods employed in the study.
