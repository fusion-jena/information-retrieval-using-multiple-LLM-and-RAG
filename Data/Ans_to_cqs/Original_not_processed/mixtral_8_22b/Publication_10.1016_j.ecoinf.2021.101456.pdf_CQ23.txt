dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

Fig. 1, and since a higher Œ≤ term favours a well generalised latent space 
over good reconstructions, a reduction in clustering performance could 
be expected. Additionally, the non-adaptive VAE was more cumbersome 
to train as the model collapsed frequently during training. 

5.4. Selection of number of clusters

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ‚àà ‚ÑùN√óF,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ‚àà ‚ÑùN√óL. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qŒ∏(z|x) ‚àº ùí© (ŒºŒ∏, œÉ2
Œ∏ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pœÜ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by Œ∏  and œÜ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

5.6. Exploring the latent space 

Samples  generated  from  the  latent  space  of  the  semi-supervised 
model  are  shown  as  a  latent  space  cart-wheel  in  Fig.  5.  Traversing 
different  lines  in  the  latent  space  results  in  samples  that  smoothly 
transition between different spectra types. As a side note, we point that 
the two latent features do not appear to be entirely disentangled; this is 
manifested as dense islands and sparse spaces of spectra in the latent 
space. For our downstream clustering task, fully disentangled features 
are  not  required.  However,  one  could  introduce  an  additional  loss 
component that enforces orthogonality between the different latent di-
mensions to achieve improved disentanglement.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are indications that efforts were made towards achieving a well-generalized latent space.

One approach mentioned is the use of a higher Œ≤ term in the optimization objective of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This term encourages a well-generalized latent space over good reconstructions, which can potentially improve the model's ability to handle new, unseen data.

Additionally, the model was trained on a dataset that was gradually expanded until satisfactory reconstructions were achieved. This gradual expansion might have helped expose the model to a broader range of examples, contributing to its generalizability.

Lastly, the model's latent space was explored, revealing that traversing different lines in the latent space resulted in smooth transitions between different spectra types. This suggests that the model has learned meaningful representations of the input data, which could contribute to better generalization.
