generalised  model  by  adding  convolution  modules  or  introducing  re-
sidual  connection  techniques.  However,  more  complex  and  deeper 
models  often  incur  higher  computational  costs  and  require  longer 
training  time.  To  solve  these  problems,  the  AlexNet  network  was 
designed to be lightweight and optimised to achieve deep training and 
short-term testing (Zhang et al., 2022). Specifically, the two convolution 
layers are merged in the model deployment mode while ensuring that 
the nonlinear factors caused by the activation function are not reduced. 
By reducing the number of layers in the model, the computational effi-
ciency is improved (Ding et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2017) and the infer-
ence time of the model is significantly shortened.

In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

• We  use  structural  re-parameterization  techniques  to  decouple  the 
training  structure  from  the  inference  structure.  This  enables  inde-
pendent optimisation of the training and reasoning stages. Moreover, 
it enables the training phase to capture more feature information, 
while  the  inference  phase  simplifies  the  model  structure,  thereby 
reducing computational costs and deployment difficulties. 

• A  dual  improvement  in  model  performance  and  efficiency  is  ach-
ieved by replacing the fully connected layer in traditional classifiers 
with convolutional layers and simplifying the model under structural 
re-parameterization.

complexity. This helps solve the problems of model training time and 
computing  resources.  Shazzadul  Islam  et  al.  (Islam  et  al.,  2019)  used 
VGG-16  to  extract  features  from  bird  images  and  then  used  support 
vector machines for classification, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The 
ResNet network (He et al., 2016) optimises the network through residual 
modules by introducing skip connections between the traditional con-
volutional layers. This enables the network to learn and retain low-level 
feature  information  better,  thereby  avoiding  gradient  vanishing  and 
representation bottlenecks. Sankupellay et al. (Sankupellay and Kono-
valov,  2018)  used  ResNet-50  to  automatically  recognise  the  spectro-
grams of 46 bird songs with an accuracy of 60%–72%.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it can be inferred that some form of advanced computing resources would have been required due to the nature of deep learning tasks. Deep learning models typically involve large amounts of data and computationally intensive operations, making them well suited for parallel processing on devices like GPUs and TPUs. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar hardware resources were employed during the development and training of the discussed models, including AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet.
