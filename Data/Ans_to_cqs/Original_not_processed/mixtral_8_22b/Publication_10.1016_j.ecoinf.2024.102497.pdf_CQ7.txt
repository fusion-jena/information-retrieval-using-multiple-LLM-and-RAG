by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

2.2. Data sources and pre-processing 

We acquired GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources 
Satellite Data and Application (http://www.cresda.com/CN/) (Table 1). 
The  GF-6  remote  sensing  data  were  preprocessed,  mainly  including 
radiometric  calibration,  atmospheric  correction,  geometric  correction 
and image cropping.

The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation.

Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is employed to evaluate its performance after fitting. The validation set can be used during the model selection phase to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Common ratios for splitting datasets are 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation, but this may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being addressed.

In the context provided, the authors mention fine-tuning specific model parameters to optimize their regression decision tree and random forest models. They also discuss preventing overfitting and minimizing cross-validation error. While they do not explicitly state how they split their data, it can be inferred that they likely followed standard practices for splitting datasets into training, testing, and validation sets to achieve optimal results.
