Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python libraryâ€™s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Hyperparameter  tuning  plays  a  crucial role  in  optimizing  the  per-
formance of a model by improving its ability to predict observed and 
predicted ranges. The tuning process maximizes the models training and 
testing  performance.  It  will  control  overfitting  or  underfitting  issues 
(Elshawi et al., 2019). Though the process is complex and takes a long 
time,  many  optimizing  methods,  such  as  Manual  Tuning,  Bayesian 
Optimization,  and  random  grid  search  methods,  simplify  the  process 
(Yang  and  Shami,  2020).  Nevertheless,  choosing  which  optimizing 
method is best for specific data is challenging. Hyperparameter tuning of 
the decision tree model are usually configured with maximum depth and 
minimum number of samples required to split a node. For the RF model, 
extensive  experimentation  was  conducted  using  varying  numbers  of 
trees  for  the  optimal  fit.  The  gradient  boosting  model  is  tuned  with

3.2.2.8. LGBM  hyperparameter  tweaking. Table  2  shows  the  LGBM 
model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the splitting criteria for deep learning model training, but it provides information about the splitting method used for machine learning models. In this case, the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation. This means that the dataset is randomly partitioned into five subsets, where each subset serves as the testing set once while the remaining four subsets form the training set. This process is repeated five times, ensuring that every observation from the original dataset has been used exactly once for validation. However, it should be noted that the context focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model performance rather than specifying the exact proportions for train, test, and validation sets typically found in deep learning applications.
