Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remark-
able stability and effectiveness in big data analytics (Bai et al., 2019; 
Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023).  Recently,  these  techniques  have  been 
increasingly  applied  to  carbon  emission  forecasting,  showcasing  their 
broad utility (Table 1). Among these, Backpropagation Neural Networks 
(BPNN) stand out for their widespread use and notable forecast accuracy 
(Lin et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2023). Yet, more recent 
studies have highlighted that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural 
networks  outperform  other  models  in  both  forecast  accuracy  and 
training  efficiency  (Kumar,  2023;  Liu  et  al.,  2024b;  Shi  et  al.,  2023). 
Furthermore,  LSTM  have  been  recognized  for  their  ability  to  adeptly 
handle multiple time-variable inputs, exhibiting superior accuracy and 
stability compared to traditional machine learning models (Gokul et al.,

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be any of the mentioned platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, or it might even be hosted somewhere else entirely. To find this information, one would need to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
