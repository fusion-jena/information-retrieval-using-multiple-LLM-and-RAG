as the method that performed poorly in some contexts (LoopA) as well as 
comparison  methods  (individual  for  a  method  that  does  not  use  the 
relabelled  points  and  CoinF  for  a  method  that  randomly  assigns  the 
initial  point  labels).  At  80%  of  hidden  observations,  we  note  major 
differences  between  the  methods  and  the  tests  of  lasso  regularization 
and bias correction. Without lasso regularization and despite the pres-
ence of bias correction, most methods cannot retrieve the initial process

the ppmlasso package.;  

• sp.scale: the spatial resolution for the quadrature grid in km—as defined in the ppmlasso package;  
• cov.bias: The column number of the variable chosen as a proxy for the observer bias in quadsenv. The default value is set to NULL;  
• kVal: the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy cov.bias. The default value is set to NULL;  
• n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path—as defined in the ppmlasso package. The default value is set to 50. 

To run the ppmlassoMixEngine, we can use the following lines:

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common steps involved in deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture so they can be loaded later without retraining. Platform selection refers to choosing where to host the deployed model, such as on cloud servers or edge devices. Integration into existing systems may involve creating APIs or other interfaces to allow communication between the deployed model and other software components.
