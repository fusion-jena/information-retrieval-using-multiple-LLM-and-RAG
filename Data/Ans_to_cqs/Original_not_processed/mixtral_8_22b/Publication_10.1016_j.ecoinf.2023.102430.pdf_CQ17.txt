AN  was  implemented  in  MATLAB  (www.mathworks.com).  For 
training,  we  used  the  stochastic  gradient  descent  with  momentum 
optimizer with default settings except for the initial learning rate (which 
we set to 0.001) and the maximum number of epochs (which we set to 15 
after  preliminary  tests).  The  ‘classical’  machine-learning  algorithms 
(AB, GB, HB, and LD) were run in Python (www.python.org) using the 
scikit-learn toolbox (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We left hyperparameters at 
scikit-learn  default  values,  except  for  the  learning  rate  of  GB  and  HB 
(which we set to 0.15) and the tolerance threshold value for LD (set to 1

2.3. Algorithm training and testing 

We trained all algorithms on a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% 

of  the  6570-picture  dataset).  To  gauge  performance  consistency,  the 
training-testing  process  was  repeated  10  times  for  each  algorithm;  in 
each of these (pseudo-)replicate runs, all five algorithms used the same 
training and testing picture subsets.

2.2. Algorithms 

We used five machine-learning algorithms based on three different 
principles: a pre-trained convolutional neural network (AlexNet); three 
boosting-based  classifiers  (AdaBoost  Adaptive  Boosting,  Gradient 
Boosting,  and  Histogram-based  Gradient  Boosting);  and  a  linear 
discriminant  model.  Here,  we  briefly  describe  the  characteristics  of 
these algorithms and the inputs that they require; further details can be 
found in the references provided below. 

The  architecture  of  AlexNet  (‘AN’  hereafter),  which  includes  five 
convolutional  layers  and  three  fully-connected  layers,  has  60  million

AB combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier capable 
of  handling  multi-class  problems;  at  each  training  iteration,  AB  uses 
weights to ‘tag’ misidentified samples so that later iterations can ‘learn’ 
these mistakes, thus improving overall accuracy (Freund and Schapire, 
1997). GB sequentially combines multiple decision trees, with iterative 
adjustment (‘learning’) based on the residual errors of previous models 
and minimization based on gradient descent (Friedman, 2001). HB is a 
fast, computationally efficient approach to gradient boosting in which 
continuous input variables (‘features’) are discretized into bins and then 
arranged as histograms; model training is thus much faster and memory 
efficient, allowing the use of gradient boosting with large datasets (Dalal 
and  Triggs,  2005).  Finally,  LD  is  a  classical  dimension-reduction  pro-
cedure  in  which  linear  functions  of  input  values  are  computed  that

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the'stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer' was used for training the AN (AlexNet) model, but without specifying whether any additional regularization techniques were applied or not. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the regularization methods used in this particular case.

However, some common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to reduce co-dependency between them, while L1/L2 regularization adds penalty terms to the loss function to discourage complex models. Early stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Data augmentation generates new training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, etc., to existing ones. Batch normalization standardizes activations across batches to improve convergence speed and stability.
