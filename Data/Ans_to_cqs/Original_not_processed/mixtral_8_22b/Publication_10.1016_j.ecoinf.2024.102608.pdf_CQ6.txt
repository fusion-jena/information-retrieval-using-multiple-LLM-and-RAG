Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithms’ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

3.1. Water quality characteristics 

The structure and functioning of the human brain serve as inspiration 
for  the  ANN,  often  known  simply  as  the  NN,  a  prominent  machine 
learning  technique.  Neurons  (the  building  blocks  of  ANNs)  are  con-
nected to one another to form a multilayer network that processes and 
transmits data. To function, the algorithm requires that data be fed into 
an input layer, which then processes the information and transmits it to 
the  hidden  levels.  A  non-linear  activation  function  is  used  by  each 
neuron in the hidden layers before the information is passed on. Next, an 
output layer generates a final prediction from the testing data based on 
the data and activation function.

exploring the parameter space using randomized grid search methods 
(Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). This approach helps strike a balance be-
tween model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the values to a standard scale. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points. Feature engineering creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance. These preprocessing steps help ensure optimal performance and accuracy when training a deep learning model.
