similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

These  spectrogram images  are  input  into  the  ResNet-50  deep  (50- 
layer) convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and 
pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories (He 
et  al.,  2015).  Although  ResNet-50  was  not  explicitly  trained  on  spec-
trograms, many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task 
can  extract  meaningful  features  distant  from  the  original  training 
dataset  (e.g.,  Almabdy  and  Elrefaei,  2019;  Bousetouane  and  Morris, 
2015; Copiaco et al., 2019; Razavian et al., 2014). A suite of features is

extracted  automatically  using  the  activations  from  ResNet-50's  deep, 
fully connected layer fc1000, located just before its classification layer. 
Based on these activations, a one vs. all support vector machine (SVM) 
classifier  is  then  used  to  identify  the  optimal  decision  boundary  to 
differentiate ‘boatwhistles' from ‘other’ signals within the feature space 
(Fig.  6)  (e.g.,  Kecman,  2005).  Using  a  pre-trained  deep  CNN  with  an 
SVM is a form of transfer learning (e.g., Bousetouane and Morris, 2015; 
Halberstadt, 2020), and the workflow mirrors that used by Bohnenstiehl 
(2023a) for cataloging American silver perch calls. 

3.5. Data labeling

reassigned  spectrogram images  of  these candidates  are formed and input  into the  pre-trained ResNet-50  con-
volutional neural network. Finally, the activations from a deep, fully connected layer within this network are 
extracted  and  passed  to  a one-vs-all  support-vector-machine  classifier, which  separates  boatwhistles  from  the 
larger set of candidate signals. This classifier model was trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset of over 
20,000 candidate signals generated over diverse acoustic conditions within Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. 
The  accompanying  software  provides  an  effective  and  efficient  tool  to  monitor  boatwhistle  calls,  which  may 
facilitate a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution, behavioral patterns, and ecological roles played by 
oyster toadfish.

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have taken place based on the overall process described.

Firstly, the raw audio data is converted into spectrogram images, which could be considered a type of preprocessing step. These spectrogram images are then fed into the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network. Before being inputted into the network, it is likely that the images underwent standard image processing techniques like resizing or cropping to fit the required dimensions of the network.

Additionally, the text mentions that the ResNet-50 network was pre-trained using millions of labeled images in over 1000 categories. This implies that the network had already gone through a significant amount of preprocessing and training before being used in this particular study.

However, without more detailed information about the exact preprocessing steps performed on the data before feeding it into the deep learning model, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved in this case.
