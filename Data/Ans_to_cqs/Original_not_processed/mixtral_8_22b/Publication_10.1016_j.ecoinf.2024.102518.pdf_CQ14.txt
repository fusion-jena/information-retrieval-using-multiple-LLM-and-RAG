feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

Helpful Answer:
The authors used a combination of feature classes ('L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP') and regularization multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 5 to tune their model. They determined the best tuning parameters by employing the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric. The optimal model was chosen based on having the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and any model with delta.AICc <2 was considered credible. Through this process, they found the optimal parameters to be the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. This approach suggests that the authors likely performed some form of grid search or systematic parameter exploration to find the best hyperparameters for their model. However, the specific method used (grid search, random search, etc.) is not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
