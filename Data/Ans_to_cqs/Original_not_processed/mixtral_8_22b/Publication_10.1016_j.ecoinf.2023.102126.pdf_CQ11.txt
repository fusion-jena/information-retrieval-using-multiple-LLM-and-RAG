To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.

2.2. Downloading the records 

The  following  variables  were  imported  for  each  record:1)  type  of 
content (dataset, data study, software, or repository), 2) data source (the 
source  from  which  the  data  were  obtained),  and  3)  Web  of  Science 
category of the data source (i.e. multidisciplinary agriculture, ecology, 
biodiversity conservation, and environmental sciences). 

The bibliographic information collected using the DCI for each re-
cord  includes  authors/creators,  year  of  publication  (the  collected  re-
cords  were  published  from  1900  to  the  present),  title  of  the  dataset, 
publisher (understood as the repository in which the data are deposited 
or the organisation responsible for making the data available), version, 
and permanent identifier (e.g. a unique URL, databank accession num-
ber, or another permanent identifier such as Handle (hdl) (http://www. 
handle.net/)).

Another aspect is the type of content, according to the differentiation 
made  by  the  DCI  between  the  dataset,  data  study,  and  software.  In 
general, most records are classified as either data studies  or datasets, 
with  software  being  much  more  residual.  Although  the  top  eight  re-
positories  contained  few  records  that  were  not  datasets,  the  case  of 
Figshare was different. In this repository, which was also the most used, 
90.52% of the records were of the data study type. Subsequently, when 
analysing the DOI of each repository through F-UJI, we found that the 
vast majority of the data study records belonged to papers published in 
this journal  (PLOS One, 2019). In the  subsequent F-UJI  analysis, Fig-
share obtained very low scores when PLOS ONE DOI was isolated from 
the remainder. This phenomenon illustrates the need to understand the 
differences between the different typologies of materials that can exist in

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, it appears that some possible data repositories include Figshare (<https://figshare.com/>), Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/>), Dryad (<https://datadryad.org/stash>), and CSIRO (<https://data.csiro.au/>). These are among the top eight repositories with the highest number of datasets deposited, accounting for nearly 95% of all datasets. It should be noted that the context does not mention any specific deep learning pipelines or their respective links. Therefore, additional information would be required to provide a definitive answer.
