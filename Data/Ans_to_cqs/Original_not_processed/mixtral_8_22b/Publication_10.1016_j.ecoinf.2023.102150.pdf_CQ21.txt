2.4. Model retraining 

Based on the quality check, the researcher can decide whether model 

performance  is  satisfactory  or  if  the  model  performance  should  be 
improved by selecting new training images and retraining the model. If 
images from new sites have been classified, model performance can be 
improved by including images from these sites in the training data set. If 
the model had problems with some classes; e.g. identification of some 
species,  it  might  help  to  include  more  images  of  these  species  in  the 
training data set. When selecting new training images, the model output 
from the original model can be helpful to find images that meet a certain 
criteria, e.g. to find images of a certain species. However, all training 
images should be reviewed manually instead of relying on model out-
puts only to avoid misclassified training images. 

2.5. Manual classification

some images from the previous years to the training data set. We then 
retrained the neural network as described before.

%Query
Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, we can infer that there could be several postprocessing steps involved after the model training. These may include evaluating the model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can also provide insights into the model's performance by showing which categories were correctly predicted and where the model made mistakes. Visualization techniques like saliency maps can also be used to understand how the model makes its predictions by highlighting important features in the input image. Furthermore, the text mentions manual review of training images to ensure no misclassifications, which can also be considered as part of postprocessing. Lastly, the process of model retraining mentioned in the context involves improving the model performance by adding new training images, which can also be seen as a form of postprocessing step.
