Individual machine learning models address large datasets and dy-
namic water quality data well but are commonly overfit. Researchers 
have employed model to address this issue. Combining weak learners 
reduces overfitting and strengthens the prediction model (Mosavi et al., 
2020). Adedeji et al., 2022 predicted stream water quality using SVM, 
RF,  XGB,  ensemble  RF-XGB,  and  ANN  models.  Panahi  et  al.  (2022) 
predicted stream flow and water quality with data pre-processing based 
on  an  ensemble  bagging  technique  combined  with  the  SVM  model. 
(Haghiabi et al., 2018) analyzed various aspects of water quality in the 
Tireh River in Iran, employing models based on ANN, group method of 
data handling (GMDH), and SVM. Among these models, the SVM model 
utilizing  the  radial  bias  function  demonstrated  outstanding  perfor-
mance,  highlighting  its  effectiveness  in  accurately  predicting  water

maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used.

As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-

the nitrate and DO model performances.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some methods used to improve the accuracy and predictive capabilities of machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced small datasets.

One approach mentioned is the use of ensemble models, which combine multiple weak learners to create a stronger prediction model. This can help reduce overfitting, which is a common problem when working with smaller datasets. For example, Adedeji et al. (2022) used ensemble models like Random Forest - Extreme Gradient Boosting (RF-XGB) to predict stream water quality. Similarly, Panahi et al. (2022) used an ensemble bagging technique combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict stream flow and water quality.

In addition, the context mentions hyperparameter tuning for LightGBM (LGBM) and Gradient Boosting (GB) models. Hyperparameters like subsample, min\_child\_samples, reg\_lambda, n\_estimators, learning\_rate, max\_depth, and random\_state are adjusted to optimize model performance. While this doesn't specifically address data bias, it contributes to improving the overall accuracy and reliability of predictions made by the models.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly cover techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it highlights several strategies for enhancing the performance of machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced small datasets.
