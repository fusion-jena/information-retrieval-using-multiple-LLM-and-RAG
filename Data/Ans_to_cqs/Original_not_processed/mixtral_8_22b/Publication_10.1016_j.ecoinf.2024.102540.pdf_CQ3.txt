Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

Usually,  growers  or  entomologists  manually  monitor  pests  using 
morphology keys, pest guides, and images to match key characteristics 
with  common  genera  and  species  names  reported  in  the  literature 
(Bishop and Hutchings, 2011). However, using machine learning, and 
specifically, deep learning approaches, has the potential to expedite this 
important component to the monitoring process by automating several 
tasks using imagery (Grijalva et al., 2023a; Grijalva et al., 2023b; Wang 
et al., 2023). Species detection and classification of organisms found in 
production sorghum fields are common tasks during standard scouting 
events  or  bouts.  Machine  learning  can  automate  these  tasks  with  the 
slightest  use  of  labor  and  time  (Chen  et  al.,  2021).  Many  traditional 
machine  learning  algorithms  have  been  used  to  classify  pests;  these 
include  the  Normal  Bayes  classifier  (a.k.a.,  Naïve  Bayes  classifier),  K

using  the  Common  Objects  in  Context  (COCO)  dataset  for  training 
(Ultralytics, 2023). As the YOLOv5 version increases from nano towards 
extra-large,  the  file  size  and  processing  time  increases  (Ultralytics, 
2023).

with an open-source Python notebook available based on the YOLOv5 
family repository by Ultralytics and Roboflow (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022;

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that they used some form of object detection annotation since they mentioned training the YOLOv5 model family, which is commonly used for object detection tasks. Furthermore, Figure 1 shows examples of images with annotations of alates using the polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment. This suggests that they might have used polygon annotation, which is a type of instance segmentation where each object is outlined with a polygonal shape. Therefore, it can be inferred that they likely used either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, specifically polygon annotation, in their deep learning pipeline.
