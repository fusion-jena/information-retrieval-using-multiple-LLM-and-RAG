CRediT authorship contribution statement

A general description of the aims 
and objectives of the study, as they 
pertain to biology and method 
scope. This should define the 
primary and secondary data to be 
measured and to what precision. 
A description of the target organisms 
for observation, and any biological 
or methodological constraints (e.g., 
taxonomic level of identification, 
size-based, behaviour, mode of life, 
sex, life-stage, etc.) 
Link to target species in WoRMS 
(those within scope, not just those 
found) 
Scope of observations: quantitative, 
semi-quantitative and/or qualitative 

Planned type of quantification

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The table does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this research.
