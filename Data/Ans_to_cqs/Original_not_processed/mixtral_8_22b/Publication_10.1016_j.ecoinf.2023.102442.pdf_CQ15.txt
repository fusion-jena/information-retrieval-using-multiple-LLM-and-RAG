due  to  ASGM  compared  to  industrial  mining.  The  results  demonstrate  the  potential  of  this  approach  that  le-
verages cloud-based machine learning with a semi-automated reclassification to allow for rapid, accurate, and 
potentially global mining detection.

18. Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) - In order to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (that are usually 
1–2 pixels in size), the minimum size of a mine for this step of the model was deemed as 3 pixels in size (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image). It is a 
common occurrence in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale, to contain isolated, misclassified individual pixels. Therefore, 
only mines above 2700 m2 were selected, removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies to ensure the 
most accurate result could be achieved.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred that common optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam) might have been employed due to their popularity in training deep learning models. These methods help minimize the loss function during the training process, enabling the model to learn effectively from the input data. Nonetheless, without direct evidence from the sources, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique was utilized in each case.
