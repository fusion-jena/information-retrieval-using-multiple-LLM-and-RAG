dataset  (Fig.  4,  legend),  it  encompasses  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  insect 
diversity.  Thus,  STARdbi  provides  a  built-in  mechanism  for  users  to 
manually  label  some  of  their  images,  and  trigger  retraining.  These 
innovative features are not available in existing datasets of annotated 
insect  images  (e.g.,  Ciampi  et  al.,  2023;  Wang  et  al.,  2020).  We  also 
acknowledge the rapid development pace of general AI-based methods 
for  image  processing,  with  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  the  algorithms 
steadily improving. Thus, we aim to periodically replace the networks 
that are currently implemented in STARdbi by new state-of-the-art ones 
as better algorithms are released. With this in mind, we don’t focus on 
STARdbi’s performance compared to other AI software for insect iden-
tification. In fact, we welcome suggestions for improved models from

caught  individuals.  Several  simple  and  effective  traps  exist,  such  as 
malaise traps, sticky traps, and pitfall traps. However, identifying and 
counting  the  trapped  specimens  is  labor-intensive  and  requires  taxo-
nomic expertise,  thus  limiting the  scale  of monitoring. Several  recent 
stud/ ies harnessed the power of deep-learning (DL) based image pro-
cessing  to  alleviate  the  burden  on  app/  b/lied  entomologists  who 
monitor  specific  forestry,  agricultural  and  medical  pests  (For  recent 
reviews, see Schneider et al., 2023, Teixeira et al., 2023). Such efforts 
comprise four steps: (a) collection of insect images; (b) labeling of in-
dividual insects by experts, to generate two or more classes (e.g., ‘pest’, 
‘natural  enemy’,  and  ‘other’);  (c)  building  a  statistical  model  of  the 
classes (training in the machine learning jargon); and (d) applying the 
model to new instances, such as field caught insects (inference). These

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the use of regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipelines they describe. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly employed in deep learning to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from dominating the others. While these techniques are widely adopted, without direct reference to them in the given sources, I cannot definitively confirm their usage in those particular studies.
