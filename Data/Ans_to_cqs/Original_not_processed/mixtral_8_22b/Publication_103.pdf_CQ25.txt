Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

Discussion and conclusions
This study is, to our knowledge, the first one that ana-
lyzes a big dataset with thousands of specimen images
from herbaria and uses deep learning. Results show the
potential of deep learning on herbarium species identifi-
cation, particularly by training and testing across different
herbarium datasets. This could potentially lead to the cre-
ation of a semi, or even fully, automatic system to help

taxonomists and experts do their annotation, classifica-
tion, and revision work at herbarium.

Table 1 shows the modified GoogleNet model with
the batch normalization added outside the Inception
modules. Just like the original GoogleNet, the model is
comprised of several inception modules, however Batch
Normalization is added inside each inception module for
faster convergence right after each pooling layer. Figure 1
shows how the modified Inception module is comprised.
The model was implemented by using the Caffe frame-
work [37]. A batch size of 16 images was used for each
iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075 with images of
224×224 resolution. Simple crop and resize data augmen-
tation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the context that the model is used for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model is employed to classify herbarium specimens and non-dried plant images. The experiments conducted measure the accuracy of the trained deep learning model under various circumstances, such as herbarium specimens classification, cross-herbaria transfer learning, and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. These experiments suggest that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to aid taxonomists and experts in their annotation, classification, and revision work at herbariums.
