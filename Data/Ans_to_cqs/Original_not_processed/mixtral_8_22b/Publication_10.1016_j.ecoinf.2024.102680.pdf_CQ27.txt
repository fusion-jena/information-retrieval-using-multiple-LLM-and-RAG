the  feature  information,  leaving  the  other  half  unprocessed.  The  un-
processed half is directly concatenated with the post-processed features. 
To  avoid  information  loss  and  extract  more  complete  information

Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

regulation. We set the batch size of all networks to 16 uniformly.

Input 

The input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations on the 
initial images. Preprocessing operations include resizing the images to 
the  required  size  and  applying  algorithms  such  as  mosaic  data 
augmentation. These preprocessing steps make the distribution of the 
input  data  more  uniform  and  enhance  the  ability  of  the  model  to 
represent  the  data,  thereby improving  the  model  performance  during 
training.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of the Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN), specifically discussing its backbone network, which includes the Concatenate Module (CM). It also mentions the use of the YOLOv8 network for feature extraction but highlights the limitations of using the C2f module due to the split operation that results in losing half of the feature information. To address this issue, the authors propose their own CM, which combines both halves of the feature information without any loss.

However, regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model, no specific details are mentioned in the provided context. Typically, once a deep learning model has been trained, it can be saved or serialized for later use. This involves saving the model's weights and architecture so that it can be loaded and used for predictions. Additionally, when deploying a deep learning model, one might consider factors like platform selection (e.g., cloud-based vs edge computing), hardware requirements, latency, scalability, etc. But again, without further context, I cannot provide specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed.
