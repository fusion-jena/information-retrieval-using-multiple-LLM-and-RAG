The  entries  of  the  database  are  subsequently  ordered  from  the 
smaller to the higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the 
first  step  of  the  LS  algorithm  and  leads  to  the  second  part,  hereafter 
defined  as  the  genetic  algorithm.  This  is  in  turn  based  on  an  iterative 
optimization, and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the 
estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. This part of 
the  process  is  analogous  to  the  previously  described  step:  the  first 
quarter  of  the  best  fit  parameter  values  stored  in  the  database  is 
considered as input for the process.

From each combination of values belonging to the first quarter of 
values stored in the Python dictionary, the GA generates four random 
combinations of initial values considered as input for the LS procedure 
previously described. Each best fit value stored in a single row of the 
dictionary is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution, 
μ, while the associated variance is still considered as σ2  = (zμ)2. Each 
new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the 
genetic algorithm is again stored in the database together with all the 
previously estimated sets of values. 

At the end of a genetic algorithm cycle, the rows of the database are 
again ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual. The 
genetic algorithm can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for 
simplicity we considered a nGAC = 2, that leads to a total number of nTGA 
= 2nGAC+1 ⋅ nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

than in laboratory trials (e.g., one week versus one day, respectively) 
with a subsequent lower availability of data series for model parameters' 
estimation. Hence, an algorithm that may consider all these issues would 
be necessary.

Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that the training process involves two main steps: the Least Squares (LS) algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). However, the context does not explicitly mention specific criteria for determining when the training is complete. Nevertheless, some insights can be derived from the description of the process.

In the case of the LS algorithm, it seems that the criterion for completion might be related to ordering the entries of the database from smaller to higher sums of residual values. This could imply that the training stops once the optimal solution or set of solutions has been found, which minimizes the sum of residuals.

Regarding the GA, the completion criterion might be linked to the number of cycles performed by the genetic algorithm, denoted as nGAC. In this particular scenario, the text mentions that they considered a nGAC equal to 2. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training completes after executing the GA for a predetermined number of cycles.

However, without further information about the specific implementation details or performance metrics, such as validation loss plateaus or other stopping conditions commonly employed in machine learning algorithms, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
