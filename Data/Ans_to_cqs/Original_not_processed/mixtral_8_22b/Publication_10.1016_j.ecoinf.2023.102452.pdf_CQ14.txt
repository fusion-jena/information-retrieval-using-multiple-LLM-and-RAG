The  last  operation  in  GP  is  Mutation,  which  involves  randomly 
selecting a node from the offspring trees and replacing it with a random 
number, variable, or operator. An illustration of the mutation operation 
can be seen in Fig. 2-c, where the division operator replaces the multi-
plication operator at the top node. These three steps are repeated until 
GP achieves a tree with a predetermined level of accuracy or reaches a

across various fields. For instance, Kushwaha et al. (2023) used Relief 
algorithm to select ground water quality parameters. IVS algorithms can 
be  broadly  classified  into  three  main  categories:  Model-Free,  Model- 
Based, and Dimension Reduction methods. Model-Free IVS approaches 
utilize  statistical  techniques,  such  as  calculating  correlations  between 
inputs  and  outputs,  to  conduct  input  selection  (Ma  et  al.,  2022;  May 
et  al.,  2011a;  Mazarei  Behbahani  and  Mazarei,  2023).  Model-Based 
methods,  on  the  other  hand,  determine  the  best  inputs  through  the 
calibration process of the model (Dariane and Behbahani, 2022; Feng 
et al., 2017; May et al., 2011b; Snieder et al., 2019). Although Model- 
Based methods provide the advantage of simultaneously applying IVS 
and  the  model  with  acceptable  accuracy,  they  often  suffer  from 
computational inefficiency, limiting their practical application. Evolu-

1999). This algorithm decodes computer programs as a set of genes and 
operates on them using an evolutionary genetic algorithm. GP solves the 
program using an initial chromosome population as the possible solu-
tions, which are configured as a Tree-shaped decomposition (Fig. 2-a) to 
show the relation between inputs and outputs. The branches of this tree 
break down the main relationship into more detailed parts, with the end 
nodes in branches representing inputs. Eq. (1) is an example relation-
ship, which its decomposition tree is shown in Fig. 2-a. The calculation 
starts  from  lower  nodes  and  moves  toward  upper  branches  (Althoey 
et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the Genetic Programming (GP) model are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide specific information about whether grid search, random search, or any other optimization method is used for tuning the hyperparameters of the GP model. However, generally speaking, hyperparameter optimization is a critical step in building machine learning models like GP. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based Optimization. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors such as computational resources, time constraints, and the complexity of the problem. In practice, researchers and practitioners often use a combination of these methods or even develop custom optimization strategies tailored to their specific needs.
