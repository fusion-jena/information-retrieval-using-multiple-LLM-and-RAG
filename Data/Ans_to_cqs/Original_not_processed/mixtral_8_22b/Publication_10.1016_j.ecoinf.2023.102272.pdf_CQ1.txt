Despite the challenges mentioned, we presented a well performing 
modelling framework that can be used by non-experts in deep learning 
(Van Kuppevelt et al., 2020) to predict disease vector abundances. Our 
work has a clear public health relevance. Integrating this approach into 
existing  disease  transmission  or  importation  models  (Lieberthal  and 
Gardner,  2021;  Salami  et  al.,  2020a;  Salami  et  al.,  2020b)  or  with 
disease-related Internet search activity (Aiken et al., 2020; Yang et al., 
2017)  and  using  high  resolution  environmental  data  will  likely 
contribute to improve operational, early warning systems of disease risk 
and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures.

Deep learning models are complex artificial neural networks (ANN; 
Lek and Gu´egan, 1999; Olden et al., 2008) composed of a large number 
of trainable parameters (LeCun et al., 2015), which are able to perform 
complex  tasks  with  high  performance,  such  as  computer  vision  and 
natural language processing but also image and sound data classification 
(Christin et al., 2019; LeCun et al., 2015). In the context of disease vector 
abundance  prediction,  a  key  difference  of  deep  learning  models  over 
conventional  approaches  is  that  the  former  allow  using  time  series 
directly as predictors and the relevance of the features found in these 
data is evaluated by the models themselves (Capinha et al., 2021; Fawaz 
et al., 2019). This is in sharp contrast to prior research, where predictors 
were typically temporally invariant, usually corresponding to a statis-
tical summarization of the variability observed in the time series data (e.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses time series directly as predictors, suggesting that the raw data could have been collected through continuous monitoring using sensors or other automated means. Additionally, the use of high-resolution environmental data indicates that publicly available datasets might have been employed. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were used for gathering the raw data.
