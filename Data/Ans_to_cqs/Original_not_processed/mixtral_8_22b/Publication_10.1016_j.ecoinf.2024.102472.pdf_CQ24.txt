adjusted to optimize the model (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021). Whereas node- 
size  determines  the  smallest  number  of  observations  in  a  tree  subset 
terminal node, and default value is always at 1 (Jafarzadeh et al., 2021; 
Pham et al., 2018). Gradient boosting iteration is a repetition process of 
increasing  or  decreasing  weights  in  a  training  datasets  (Huang  et  al., 
2022). All hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. 

2.5.1. Artificial neural networks

During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

One strategy to manage randomness is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure that their results remain consistent across different runs of the same experiment. This approach helps maintain consistency when comparing models or evaluating performance.

Another strategy involves employing cross-validation techniques, which involve splitting the dataset into multiple subsets for training and testing purposes. Cross-validation methods like k-fold cross-validation help reduce variability caused by random sampling during the creation of these subsets.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also mitigate the effects of randomness. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce more robust and accurate predictions. Techniques such as bagging and boosting create diverse sets of models, reducing the impact of random initialization and improving overall performance.

Lastly, hyperparameter optimization plays a crucial role in minimizing the effect of randomness. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization methods can be utilized to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a particular problem. These methods systematically explore the parameter space, helping to identify optimal configurations that lead to better model performance.
