For the ViT models, we adapted the approach of pretraining deep
bidirectional transformers for language understanding (BERT) by Devlin
et al. (2018) for birdsong classification. Table 3 provides an overview of
the investigated ViT models with their respective parameterizations.
ViT-S/16, for example, denotes a ViT variant of reduced complexity with
an input patch size of 16 Ã— 16. The sequence length of the transformer
models is inversely proportional to the square of the provided patch size.
In the following, ViT-B/16 is further investigated as it strikes a balance
between general model complexity and classification performance.

In ecology, changes in environmental conditions are often closely linked to shifts in species diversity. This
relationship can be investigated by analyzing avian vocalizations, which are robust indicators of trends in
biodiversity. Within this contribution, we explored various data augmentation techniques and deep learning
strategies for the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes. For this purpose, we employed three
fundamental deep neural network architectures, such as vision transformers, to classify 397 different bird spe-
cies. To improve both the accuracy and generalizability of our models, we incorporated up to 19 well-established
data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included an iterative selection process
where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation
technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly

The evaluated augmentation techniques consistently exhibited the
same qualitative effects across all three of our deep learning models.
Specifically, if the performance of an augmentation set improved for one
model, it also improved for the other two, and vice versa. However,
further research is needed to determine if this observation can be
generalized. For optimizing augmentation strategies, a more effective
approach would be to use only the least computationally intensive
models, e.g., DenseNet-161 or ResNet-50. The best combined augmen-
tations would then be applied to the best-performing model (ViT-B/16).
In our future work, we plan on focusing on the creation of so-called
no-call classifiers with training samples that do not contain bird events
in general. For this purpose, as well as to explore different transformer-
based models with improved prediction scores, encompassing, i.a., data-
efficient image transformers (DeiT) as well as hybrid transformers (Han

training or validation progress could be observed. To fine-tune our ViT
models, we deployed ImageNet-based weights for pretraining.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of recordings from 397 different bird species. This wide range of species helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the models could accurately classify birdsongs even when presented with new, unseen species. Secondly, extensive data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the models' ability to handle variations in real-world scenarios. These techniques included integrating various noise samples and non-bird audio elements into the training data. An iterative selection process was followed where only those augmentations that improved classification performance were chosen. Lastly, the study focused on using multiple deep learning models, including Vision Transformers (ViT), DenseNet-161, and ResNet-50. By comparing these models and selecting the best performing one (ViT-B/16), the researchers aimed to create a highly accurate and generalizable model for birdsong classification.
