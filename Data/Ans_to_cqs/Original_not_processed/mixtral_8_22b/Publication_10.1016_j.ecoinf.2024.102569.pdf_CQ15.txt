To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2)

and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ,

and  γ-divergence  (see  Appendix  D  for  the  details).  The  estimating 
functions based on these divergences commonly have a weight that is a 
power of the intensity function. In our simulation studies, we observed 
that results for these divergences differed dramatically and the compu-
tation  algorithm  failed  to  converge  when  the  value  of  the  tuning 
parameter was slightly changed. At that time, the weights of the power 
of intensity function were extremely large for a small subset of the data, 
which might have led to the instability in the estimation. In contrast, the 
proposed estimator employs a weight rescaled by a distribution function 
F,  limiting  the  weight  to  a  range  from  0  to  1,  which  contributed  to 
achieve the stable estimation.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the optimization technique used in this case is not one typically associated with deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the context suggests that the authors use the gradient ascent method to compute the L1 penalized estimates. This method involves iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model in the direction of steepest ascent of the objective function until convergence is achieved. It's important to note that while gradient descent methods like SGD and Adam are often used in deep learning models, other types of machine learning models may utilize different optimization techniques depending on their specific requirements and objectives.
