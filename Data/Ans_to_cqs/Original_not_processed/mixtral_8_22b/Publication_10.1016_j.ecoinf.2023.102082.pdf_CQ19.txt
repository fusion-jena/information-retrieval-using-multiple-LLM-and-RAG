Lang10m  was  derived  fusing  the  GEDI  and  Sentinel-2  images 
through a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022). It has 
spatial resolution of 10 m and is valid for the year 2020. The canopy top 
height was defined as the relative height at which 98% of the energy was 
returned  (RH98).  For  the  modelling  GEDI  observations  for  which  the 
image was cloudy or snow-covered were excluded.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a deep convolutional neural network was employed to derive Lang10m from GEDI and Sentinel-2 images. Deep convolutional neural networks can be implemented using various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Without additional information, it cannot be determined which framework was utilized in this case.
