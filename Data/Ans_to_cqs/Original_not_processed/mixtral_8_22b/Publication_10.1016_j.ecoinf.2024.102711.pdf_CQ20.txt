Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

tuning dataset is excluded from the training process. The model is then 
developed using the remaining dataset (i.e. the training dataset), and its 
performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average perfor-
mance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the 
performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyper-
parameters (Velasco Hererra et al., 2022). For this study, a value of 5 is 
assumed  for  k.  Grid  search  is  employed  to  evaluate  the  data-driven 
model’s  performance  using  each  combination  of  predefined  hyper-
parameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth 
of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning 
rate (which shows how fast the model learns) are tuned in this study as 
the influential hyperparameters (Cakiroglu et al., 2022).

3.2. Hyperparameter tuning of random Forest and XGBoost 

We determine the optimal hyperparameters to achieve peak perfor-
mance for the RF and XGBoost models through a 5-fold cross-validation 
process (Table 2). The findings reveal that RF models necessitate greater 
depth compared to XGBoost, while the number of estimators is roughly
