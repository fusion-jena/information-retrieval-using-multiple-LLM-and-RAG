2.3.1. Model architectures 

(1)  Unet.  By  incorporating  an  encoder-decoder  structure  that  es-
tablishes shortcut connections, Unet model extended upon FCN’s end-to- 
end concept (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The input to the network is a 
512  × 512  pixels  image  (Fig.  3).  The  encoder  (left  dashed  square) 
downsamples the input tensor and encodes it into a vector with reduced 
dimensions. It consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each including 
a  3  × 3  convolutional  kernel  layer,  batch  normalization,  and  an

2023; Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). The model’s initial learning 
rate was set to 0.01, further refined via iterative testing. The number of 
iterations was 150, with a batch size of 4, downsampling multiplier set 
at 8, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss 
function.

DATAID=217).  Both  climate  and  DEM  data  were  resampled  to  10  m 
spatial resolution through ArcGIS. Mean groundwater data from April to 
September, featuring a 10 m resolution, were derived from a Machine 
Learning  model  constructed  based  on  groundwater  monitoring  data 
collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin (model details 
can be referenced in Liu et al., 2022b).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some aspects can be inferred indirectly. For instance, the use of diverse datasets such as remote sensing images of the study area and mean groundwater data from April to September suggests that the model might have been trained on varied data sources. Additionally, the mention of iterative testing implies that the model underwent several rounds of validation or optimization, which could potentially contribute to its robustness and generalizability. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken for ensuring the model's generalizability.
