Employing GridSearchCV ensured that each candidate combination 
of  hyperparameters  is  assessed  using  cross-validation  with  a  fixed 
number of folds, in this case, ten, as highlighted by Shahhosseini et al. 
(2021). This tenfold cross-validation provides a reliable estimate of the 
model’s performance, balancing the trade-off between bias and variance 
and  guarding  against  overfitting.  The  hyperparameter  tuning  process 
implemented  in  this  study  relied  on  a  detailed  and  systematic  search 
across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. A unique parameter 
grid  was  defined  for  each  model  considered,  targeting specific  model 
characteristics such as the number of estimators in ensemble methods or 
the  depth  of  trees  in  decision  tree-based  algorithms.  This  process 
ensured that the eventual choice of hyperparameters was not arbitrary 
but  is  backed  by  empirical  evidence  that  aligns  with  Schratz  et  al.

(2019),  stating  that  optimal  hyperparameter  settings  are  critical  to 
reducing bias in the model predictions.

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

The  choice  and  tuning  of  parameters  played  a  critical  role  in  the 
performance of these models (Yang and Shami, 2020). Parameters like 
‘max_depth’ in tree-based models and ‘learning_rate’ in boosting models 
impacted the ability of the model to learn the data without overfitting. 

Similarly, the number of estimators or iterations controlled the extent of 
learning, making it a crucial parameter for model optimization.

Helpful Answer:

Hyperparameters of the model were optimized through a process called Grid Search Cross Validation (GridSearchCV). This method ensures that every possible combination of hyperparameters is evaluated using cross-validation with a fixed number of folds. In this particular case, the number of folds used was ten.

Each model had its own unique parameter grid, specifically designed to target certain characteristics of the model. For instance, in ensemble methods, the number of estimators was targeted, while in decision tree-based algorithms, the depth of trees was focused upon.

This meticulous and systematic search across a predetermined grid of hyperparameter values guaranteed that the final selection of hyperparameters was not arbitrary but supported by empirical evidence. It also helped in reducing bias in the model predictions, which is critical according to Schratz et al. (2019).

Moreover, the'max_depth' in tree-based models and 'learning_rate' in boosting models were among the key parameters that influenced the model's capacity to learn from the data without overfitting. Similarly, the number of estimators or iterations was another significant parameter that determined the degree of learning, thereby playing a vital role in model optimization.
