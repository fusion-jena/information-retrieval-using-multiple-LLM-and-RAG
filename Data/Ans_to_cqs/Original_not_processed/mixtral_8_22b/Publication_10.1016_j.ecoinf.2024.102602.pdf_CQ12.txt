2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

high accuracy (96.88%), sensitivity (94.00%), specificity (99.75%) and 
f1-score (96.78%). In the case of the EfficientNetB0 model, only 4% of 
the  images  displaying  the  Cortaderia  selloana  were  confused  by  the 
model as showing no C. selloana (false negatives; Fig. A.1c). Likewise, 
from  the  images  showing  no  C.  selloana,  in  1%  of  the  cases  Effi-
cientNetB0  incorrectly  predicted  the  class  “With  Cortaderia  selloana” 
(false  positives;  Fig.  A.1d).  A  similar  pattern  was  verified  for  the 
remaining CNNs (see confusion matrices in Tables A.6 and A.7).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as its primary deep learning model. Specifically, it employs six pre-existing open-source CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These networks have been chosen due to their proven effectiveness in transfer learning and high performance in comparable classification tasks. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes the Faster R-CNN ResNet50 architecture for object detection purposes.
