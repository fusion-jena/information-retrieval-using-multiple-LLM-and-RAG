Whatever the goal, our framework is highly flexible and can be adapted by tuning the species thresholds 
regulating the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage in an attempt to monitor biodiversity 
through big datasets where species are unidentified. To unclog the bottleneck of information extraction about 
organism forms, behaviors and sounds from massive digital data, machine learning algorithms, and particularly 
the last generation of deep learning algorithms, offer immense promises. Here we propose to help the users to 
control their error rates in ecology. This is a valuable addition to the ecologist’s toolkit towards a routine and 
robust analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors. With this control of error 
rate in the hands of users, Deep Learning Algorithms can be used for real applications, with acceptable and

training datasets.

•  In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a CNN on a given database T0 (Fig. 2a)
•  Then, the second phase consists of tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e. each species in our 

case), noted i, with i ∈ {1, ..., n} , using a second and independent database noted T1 (Fig. 2b).

In terms of classification, it means we transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) in 3 options 

(Fig. 3) by applying Eqs. (15, 16).

Computing the confidence thresholds.  After the phase 1 (model training phase), for an image X of the 
threshold tuning dataset processed by the classifier, we obtain an output {C(X), S(X)} , where C(X) is the class 
(i.e. species, belonging to the trained set of species) with the highest classification score S(X). For this image, we 
know the ground truth Y in {1, .., n} belonging to the same set of species classes.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. These techniques are often used when working with image data, such as those mentioned in the context like underwater images or plant species images. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding object category. Instance segmentation combines both bounding boxes and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. Without more specific details from the context, it cannot be determined which technique was used in this particular case.
