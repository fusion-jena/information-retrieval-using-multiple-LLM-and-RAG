Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

where x denotes the input features, n is the number of input features, m 
(2)
kj  are the 
weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer, respectively, and

Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithmsâ€™ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

in various scientific domains. Machine learning algorithms can extract 
patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b; 
Pahlevan et al., 2019b). This combination is particularly suited to large- 
scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including 
neural  network  (NN)  (Hong  et  al.,  2022;  Reichstein  et  al.,  2019),

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing. These applications suggest that the data formats used could include images, audio files, text data, or other relevant formats depending on the specific application. Additionally, the study focuses on advancing reservoirs water quality parameters estimation using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data, which implies the use of remote sensing data. Therefore, the data formats used in this particular case might include satellite imagery or geospatial data.
