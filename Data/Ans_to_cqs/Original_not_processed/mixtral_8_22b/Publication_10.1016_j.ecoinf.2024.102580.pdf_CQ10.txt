Fig. 1. Workflow used to (a) select a deep learning model, (b) develop a ground-truth imagery dataset, (c) train the deep learning models, (d & e) evaluate model 
performance and (f & g) obtain the data and analyse it to quantify the spatial patterns and resilience of the ecosystem. 

2.3. Deep learning models 

2.3.1. Semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping

By providing the tools to conduct these analyses, we aim to stimulate the uptake of deep learning for enhancing 
the data obtained from aerial imagery to improve the monitoring and conservation of natural ecosystems.

Data availability 

The deep learning and post-processing scripts along with the 2012 
aerial  imagery  and  data  output  used  in  this  study  can  be  found  at

Access  to  required  computing  resources  is  another  challenge. 
Training  deep  neural  networks  for  semantic  segmentation  and  object 
detection traditionally requires expensive computational resources with 
multiple high-end GPUs (e.g., available on high-performance computing
