Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through remote sensing techniques. This involves utilizing various types of sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones to capture images and other forms of data from the Earth's surface. Some prominent examples of these sensors include multispectral scanners, hyperspectral scanners, LiDAR systems, and radar systems. Additionally, publicly available datasets can also be used as sources of raw data. These datasets may contain preprocessed satellite or airborne imagery, ground truth labels, or other relevant information. In some cases, traditional survey methods, such as field observations or interviews, may also be employed to gather additional data. However, it should be noted that the specific methods used for data collection will depend on the particular application and objectives of the deep learning project.
