2019; Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019) and then machine learning and, 
more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the 
traditional  data  management  systems  are  inadequate  to  handle  the 
volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and 
IoT devices (Wolfert et al., 2017). Hence the advanced data management

24.  Which features will you need for data preprocessing?  

• Data deduplication (Eliminating excessive copies of data)

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context only mentions that machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied to analyze data generated by sensors and IoT devices in smart farming. It also notes that traditional data management systems may be inadequate to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of such data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors might have considered these challenges while developing their models, but without further details, we cannot confirm the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
