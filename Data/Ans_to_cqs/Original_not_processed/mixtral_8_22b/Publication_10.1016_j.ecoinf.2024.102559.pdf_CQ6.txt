6. Conclusion 

Preserve, where The Nature Conservancy is actively working to priori-
tize its iceplant removal efforts. This machine learning application opens 
the door to scale methods across space and over time efficiently. While 
some steps require manual input (for example, creating a training set for 
a  minority  class  in  the  landscape),  the  emphasis  on  creating  a  repro-
ducible data analysis and validation workflow makes it possible for the 
methods presented to be adapted and applied across California and to all 
the other Mediterranean climatic regions in the world, plus over time to 
understand the spread and mitigation of iceplant invasions.

structures (e.g., roads and buildings) and water from slowing down the 
classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

Despite its invasive nature, iceplant remains a minority land cover 
class  in  most  NAIP  scenes  in  this  region  compared  to  non-iceplant 
vegetation. Generating training and test data by sampling designs such 
as  random  sampling  or  allocating  samples  in  proportion  to  expected 
class  areas  would  therefore  result  in  a  highly  unbalanced  dataset. 
Training machine learning models with unbalanced sets poses a chal-
lenge to accurately predicting the minority class, often leading to under- 
predicting  it,  and  multiple  methods  exist in  the  literature  to  improve 
balance  in  a  dataset  (He  and  Garcia,  2009).  Due  to  the  high  spatial 
resolution of NAIP and the expanse of the study region, data availability 
for both classes allowed us to create a reasonably balanced final training 
dataset  having  38%  iceplant  points  and  62%  other  vegetation  points 
without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, there are some relevant details about preparing the data for the machine learning process. For instance, the text mentions reducing the number of pixels per scene to 3,757,323 and taking an average of 18 seconds per scene. This could imply some form of image resizing or cropping to optimize computational resources. Additionally, the authors discuss addressing the issue of imbalanced datasets due to iceplant being a minority land cover class. They managed to create a relatively balanced dataset without resorting to techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or generating synthetic data points. Although these aren't traditional preprocessing steps for deep learning models, they do highlight important considerations when dealing with real-world datasets.
