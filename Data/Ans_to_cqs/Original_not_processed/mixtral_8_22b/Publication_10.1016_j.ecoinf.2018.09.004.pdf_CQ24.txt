Random Forest. A Random Forest is an ensemble strategy that joins
numerous individual classiﬁcation trees in the accompanying route:
from the ﬁrst example, numerous bootstrap tests and segments of in-
dicators are drawn, and an unpruned classiﬁcation tree is ﬁtted to each
bootstrap test utilizing the inspected indicators. From the complete
forest, the status of the response variable is typically anticipated as the
prediction of the forecasts of all trees as the class with majority vote for
classiﬁcation (Breiman, 2001).

3.3. Evaluation measures

A measure commonly used to evaluate classiﬁcation results is
Accuracy, which is the ratio of correct to all classiﬁcation decisions.
Accuracy is a good metric for balanced datasets, like the case studied
here for seagrass presence–absence, and is deﬁned as:

In this paper, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques to ex-
amine the presence–absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean
Sea, and the environmental relationship among seagrasses at family
level. To achieve these, we combine data from a broad and diverse
range of databases, such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, aiming to
determine the most appropriate variables aﬀecting the distribution of
seagrasses. We used static and temporal variables and chose the most
important ones with variable importance method by the random forest
algorithm. The temporal variables have additional features such as the
values for each month, along with the year min, max and average for
surface and seabed, totaling 217 variables. In order to perform binary
classiﬁcation we propose a method to automatically generate an ab-
sence dataset based on the presence dataset. For both binary and multi-
class classiﬁcation, 7 diﬀerent classiﬁers are compared and their results
are discussed.

4.2. Detecting seagrass family

Another problem we try to solve is: ‘If a seagrass exists, which fa-
mily is it?’ This, based on our dataset, is deﬁned as a one-of multi-class
classiﬁcation problem. Note that all experiments in this section do not
involve any artiﬁcially-generated data, so the absolute numbers of the
evaluation measures are not aﬀected. As before, we ﬁrstly investigate
the variable importance using Random Forest.

Out of the top-10 features, 5 diﬀerent chlorophyll-α months were
again present. So, chlorophyll-α levels are also important for seagrass

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning or managing randomness within its pipeline. Instead, it focuses on applying machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, to examine the presence-absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea.

That said, there are general strategies to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines that could be applied to deep learning as well. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation to reduce variance due to random sampling, and employing ensembling methods like bagging or boosting to improve model performance and stability.

Regarding the specific issue of random seed values, they can significantly impact the initialization of weights in neural networks and the selection of training samples during stochastic gradient descent. To ensure consistency and reproducibility across different runs, researchers often set a fixed seed value at the beginning of their code. This way, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code is executed, leading to consistent results.
