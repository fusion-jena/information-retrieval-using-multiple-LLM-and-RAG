Fig. 3. CNN model architecture and band reflectance of water quality monitorings (partial). The convolutional layer is a layer that extracts or detects input image 
features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

the study area is shown in Fig. 5. The CNN structure, depicted in Fig. 3, 
comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully con-
nected  layers,  and  three  water-quality  level  labels  including  Class  I, 
Class II, and Class III. To enhance model reliability, a dropout function 
was incorporated between the fully connected layers. Parameters were 
set with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50% post the 
fully connected layer. The training was conducted over 500 epochs with 
(cid:0) 4, momentum at 0.9, with the learning rate 
an initial learning rate of 10
halved  every  20  rounds  to  optimize  performance,  culminating  in  the 
selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific criteria used to split their dataset for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, they do mention that they use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for training and provide details about its architecture and parameters. They also discuss the incorporation of a dropout function to improve model reliability.

Typically, when working with machine learning models like CNNs, datasets are often divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. This division helps prevent overfitting and allows for better evaluation of the model's performance. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time series based splits depending on the nature of the problem and available resources.

Without explicit information from the authors regarding the criteria used to split their data, we can only speculate that they might have followed standard practices such as randomly dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. It would be best to refer directly to the paper or contact the authors for more precise information if needed.
