filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention. Bars with gray outlines and white filling represent BMPs for which efficiency data was 
not available.

Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

Fig. 6b illustrates an example wherein the tool identifies locations 
characterized by higher TN loads and the least favorable conditions of 
the social vulnerability index (group 4), which are visually represented 
as darker purple areas. By selecting any of these prioritized locations (i. 
e., the darker purple polygons where BMP implementation is crucial), 
users  can  access  comprehensive  information  about  the  corresponding 
census tract and watershed attributes including all environmental jus-
tice metrics and pollutant loads (as depicted in Fig. 6b). In this particular 
scenario,  these  locations  represent  areas  with  higher  TN  values  and 
higher social vulnerability status; however, users have the flexibility to 
choose alternative metrics such as TP, TSS, and BOD, alongside specific 
indices related to racial/ethnicity or socioeconomic factors or individual 
environmental justice metrics. This selection enables the identification

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used methods like grid search or random search.

Based on the given context, it appears that we are discussing a geospatial tool designed to help identify priority locations for implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce water pollutants and improve environmental justice outcomes. However, the context does not mention anything about machine learning models or their optimization techniques, such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning. Thus, I am unable to provide an accurate response regarding the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
