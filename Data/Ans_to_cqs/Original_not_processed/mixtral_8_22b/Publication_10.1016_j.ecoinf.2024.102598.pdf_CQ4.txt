over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

Among the five MLMs evaluated, the AUC analysis revealed that RF 
and SVM performed remarkably well with training AUC values of 0.868 
± 0.002 and 0.857 ± 0.001, respectively. MARS followed this, and BRT 
gained  training  AUC  scores  of  0.829  ± 0.001  and  0.809  ± 0.002, 
respectively,  while  CART  exhibited  poor  performance  with  a  low 
training AUC of 0.781 ± 0.001. Similar trends were observed for TSS, 
where  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT  outperform  CART  (Table  3).  All  models 
exhibited  robust  agreement  with  the  predicted  results  in  terms  of  ac-
curacy.  Additionally,  when  considering  the  kappa  and  phi  for  recog-
nizing  accurate  forest  fire  pixels,  all  models,  RF,  SVM,  MARS,  BRT 
outperformed CART (Table 3). The Δ  AUC was lowest for CART with 
0.002, followed by MARS and BRT with both values of 0.003. The Δ AUC 
was  highest  for  RF  and  SVM  with  the  values  of  0.022  and  0.021,
