total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the 
model  accuracy  during  the  training  phase,  and  356  image  pairs  for 
testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

The proposed network was compared on the WSGD test dataset with 
the current state of the art model: UNet used by Giles(Giles et al., 2021) 
and seed pixel region growing used by Chong (Chong et al., 2022), and 
several  classic  semantic  segmentation  networks  (PSPNet,  HRNet  and 
UNet++). The quantitative results of the neural network are shown in 
Table  2,  and  the  qualitative  results  of  the  seed  pixel  region  growing 
algorithm and the neural network are shown in Fig. 7. 

It can be concluded from the table above, the Res_AUNet network 
achieved  the  best  performance,  followed  by  UNet  and  UNet++ net-
works. The F1-score of UNet++ network reached 0.8107, IOU reached 
0.7124, while HRNet and PSPNet had the worst performance, with an 
Accuracy of less than 70%.

Helpful Answer:

The study uses a total of 1764 image pairs for their deep learning model. Out of these, 1232 image pairs are used for training the deep neural network, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network after training. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on the purpose of each set - training, validation, or testing.
