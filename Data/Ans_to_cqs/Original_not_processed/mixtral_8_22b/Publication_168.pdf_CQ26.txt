The pooling layer is mainly applied to compress the input 
data,  which  often  follows  convolutional  layer.  The  max-
pooling strategy is used in SSPCNN.

On the other hand, since the powerful feature extraction 
capabilities, the deep learning methods have succeed in many 
fields,  such  as  computer  vision  and  natural  language 
processing. In recently, the deep learning based methods have 
also  been  used  to  solve  the  HSI  classification  task  and 
achieved remarkable achievements. Among the deep learning 
methods,  the  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
most widely explored to solve the HSI classification task. Hu 
et  al.  [4]  designed  a  one-dimensional  convolutional  neural 
network(1-D-CNN) for classification according to the spectral 
feature  of  HSI.  Due  to  the  insufficient  training  data,  the 
designed  1-D-CNN  just  includes  a  convolution  operation,  a 
pooling operation and a fully connected operation. Although 
the structure of  designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a 
satisfactory  classification  performance.  The  classification

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  experiment  is  performed  on  the  UAV  hyperspectral 
image  described  in  section  II.  There  are  ten  different  land-
cover  classes  in  the  captured  UAV  hyperspectral  image  as 
shown in Table I. Considering it is hard to label hyperspectral 
image in the real world, we split the labeled pixels of UAV 
hyperspectral image into the training set and test set with the 
ratio 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights 
and  biases  of  the  network,  and  the  test  samples  are  used  to 
evaluate the classification performance.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance or bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help ensure that the model does not become biased towards certain classes due to uneven distribution of data.

In the case of the given context, the authors do mention that they use a ratio of 1:9 to split the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image into training and testing sets. This could potentially indicate that they are using stratified sampling to maintain class balance between the two sets. However, without further clarification from the authors, it cannot be confirmed if this was done specifically to address data bias.
