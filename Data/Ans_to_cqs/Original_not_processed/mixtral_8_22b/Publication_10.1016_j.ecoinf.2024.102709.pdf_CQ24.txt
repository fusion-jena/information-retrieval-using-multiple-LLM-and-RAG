split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

When  testing  Model  4  on  a  test  dataset  of  preprocessed  original 
images from our dataset, it can be seen that on average, only 51.5% of 
the images in the test batch were classified correctly (Table 8). Espe-
cially among examples of the digits 0, 2, and 5, low values (below 40%) 

are observed, whereas the digits 1 and 4 (with values above 70%) are 
predicted correctly more often (for exact values, see tables in the pub-
lished dataset). Furthermore, there were multiple misclassifications of 
clusters that showed streaks or other irregularities. 

However,  when  applying  the  model  to  images  of  the  extracted 
clusters from the color recognition, the numbers can be recognized with 
an accuracy of 97.3%, given the ideal train-test split.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed random seeds during training to ensure reproducibility. This means setting a specific seed value for the pseudo-random number generator used in various parts of the pipeline, such as weight initialization, shuffling the dataset, or generating augmentations. By doing so, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated each time the code runs, leading to consistent results across experiments.

Another strategy is employing techniques like k-fold cross-validation or repeated random sub-sampling validation to reduce the impact of randomness on performance estimates. These methods involve splitting the dataset into multiple folds or subsamples and averaging the performance metrics obtained from each fold or subsample. This helps mitigate the effects of chance splits and provides a more robust estimate of the model's generalization ability.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also help manage randomness. Ensemble models combine predictions from multiple base learners trained independently on different subsets of the data or with varying hyperparameters. The final output is typically derived through voting or averaging the outputs of individual models. Since ensembles aggregate diverse perspectives, they tend to produce more stable and accurate predictions compared to single models.

Lastly, conducting thorough ablation studies and sensitivity analyses can shed light on how sensitive the model's performance is to changes in random factors. By systematically altering one factor while keeping others constant, researchers can gain insights into which components contribute most significantly to overall performance variability.
