cover. The interquartile range for observed: Q1 = 65%, Q2 (median) =
86%, and Q3 = 96%, and predicted: Q1 = 63%–69%, Q2 = 83%–87%,
and Q3 = 88% –91%. The minimum and maximum canopy cover for
observed and all the models are 0% and 100%, respectively. Similarly,
the density of the observed and predicted canopy cover is higher in Q3 as
the violin's shape is expanded in those regions.

3.3. Variable importance

XGboost is an advanced version of the gradient-boosting decision
tree method (Friedman, 2001), a composition of multiple decision trees.
The XGboost combines different week regression trees into a robust
model, where each tree can correct the residuals from previous tree
predictions (Yu et al., 2020). The hyperparameters encompass variables
such as max_depth (the upper limit on tree depth), n_estimators (quan-
tity of iterations), eta (shrinkage factor), learning_rate (augments model
stability by moderating step weights), min_child_weight (minimum total
weight sum of observations required in a child), colsample_bytree
(portion of columns chosen randomly per tree), subsample (portion of
observations randomly chosen per tree), and gamma or alias: min_spli-
t_loss (minimum loss decrease necessary for a split).

linear as a simple statistical model and the rest of the advanced machine
learning models as machine learning. The regression analyses were
conducted using Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc. The Scikit-
learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was employed for all models except
those utilising XGboost and LightGBM. For XGboost and LightGBM
models, the respective Python libraries “xgboost” (Chen and Guestrin,
2016) and “lightgbm” (Ke et al., 2017) were utilised. Additionally, a 5-
fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune
hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning
models, leveraging functionalities inherent in their respective Python
packages. The information on hyperparameters and their optimised
value for all machine learning models are presented in Table 4. More-
over, we converted the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction
(0–1) for convenience and smoothness in the further calculation.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, some common methods used in machine learning include monitoring the validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these metrics reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. Another approach could be setting a fixed number of epochs or iterations for training. In this case, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This suggests that the training process might have been stopped based on the performance achieved after tuning the hyperparameters. Nonetheless, without more detailed information about the exact training procedure followed, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
