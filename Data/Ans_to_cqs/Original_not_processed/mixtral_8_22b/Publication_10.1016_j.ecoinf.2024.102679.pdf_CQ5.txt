surveys of PAs covering thousands of square kilometers and generating 
thousands of images can be delayed by several months using the OCC 
approach due to the slow but necessary manual processing of images. 
Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  propelled  the  perspec-
tives of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 
2022),  and  announced  good  prospects  for  the  automation  of  image 
processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom 
et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL) is a subgroup of machine learning and 
artificial intelligence (AI) where artificial neural networks are trained to 
achieve challenging tasks (e.g. detect animals in aerial imagery) through 
a complex multi-level representation of information learned from a large 
amounts of data (LeCun et al., 2015). In the last decade, DL has been 
widely  employed  to  (semi-)automate  the  detection  and  counting  of

practices to address a substantially imbalanced dataset with deep learning. Remote

190,686 images were saved in 6000 × 4000 pixels JPEG format, from 
which 148,239 appeared on transect after cleaning. All images were geo- 
referenced  in  UTM  coordinates  using  the  GeoSetter2  software  which 
associated the altimeter's GPS tracklog to the exact acquisition time of 
each image. 

2.4. Deep learning model 

The DL architecture HerdNet3  (Delplanque et al., 2023a) has been 
selected  for  processing  the  aerial  survey  images  given  its  attractive 
performances on a previous SRF-OCC study (Delplanque et al., 2023b). 
HerdNet is a single-stage fully convolutional neural network built with 
two heads: one dedicated to the accurate point detection of animals in 
the image and the other to their classification.

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the selected deep learning architecture, HerdNet, was chosen based on its performance in a previous SRF-OCC study. This suggests that the dataset used might be related to wildlife or animal detection in aerial imagery. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized.
