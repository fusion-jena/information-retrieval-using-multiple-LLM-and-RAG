follows:

keyword  search,  literature  screening,  and  data  compilation.  In  this 
database, SOCS data are organized considering depths from 0 to 20 cm 
and 0â€“100 cm. In this study, a set of 2207 SOCS at depths from 0 to 20 
cm from 2010 to 2014 was retrieved from the database.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the parameter selection for the MLP model was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete might be related to achieving a minimum or stable value of the mean squared error during the training process. However, the context does not explicitly state what specific criteria were used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other commonly used stopping criteria. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot definitively conclude what criteria were used to determine when training is complete.
