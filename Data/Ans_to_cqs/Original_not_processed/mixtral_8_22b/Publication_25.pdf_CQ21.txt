improve with a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples.

solely using the hand-annotated data. This allows for a direct comparison of the contribution of
high-quality annotations when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining
both self-supervision and hand-annotation data.

combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

Figure 8. Improvement in prediction quality during the training pipeline. (A) Bounding boxes from the
lidar-based unsupervised detection erroneously identiﬁed artiﬁcial structures as trees. (B) Predictions
from the self-supervised RGB model showed that the addition of RGB data diminished the eﬀect
of incorrectly labeled training data, with only edges of the artiﬁcial structures maintained as tree
predictions. (C) In the full semi-supervised model, combining the self-supervised RGB data with
hand-annotations eliminated the inﬂuence of the original misclassiﬁcation in the training data, while
still capturing the majority of trees in the image.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does discuss various aspects related to improving the model performance through different methods like using better validation data, more hand-annotated training samples, combining self-supervised learning with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, and comparing the contributions of high-quality annotations versus self-supervised models.

The Figure 8 shows how the prediction quality improves during the training pipeline, starting from bounding boxes generated by lidar-based unsupervised detection, then predictions from the self-supervised RGB model, and finally the full semi-supervised model combining both self-supervised RGB data and hand-annotations. Although this process doesn't directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, it provides insights into the iterative improvement of the model's predictive capabilities throughout its development.
