total time (min)

of the recognizer, we chose the optimal cut-off thresholds (in the case of 
identical F-scores, we used the mean of the thresholds); (4) we ran a 
random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test 
set and evaluated its performance; and (5) we implemented the same 
recognizer and threshold to the target set to obtain biologically relevant 
data.

All the parameters used for all the recognizers are shown in Table S2. 

2.6. Data analysis: Target set 

The analyses of the target set aimed to detect possible differences 
among the software programs in evaluating the results with regard to 
two different aspects: (1) the possibility that different habitats produce 
more or fewer song detections per day and (2) the possibility that great 
tits in different habitats have different times of vocal activity, regardless 
of the total number of songs. Given that the days and sites used to obtain 
the  data  for  the  training  and  target  sets  were  the  same  for  all  three 
software programs, any differences among the software programs must 
be exclusively due to differences or biases in their detection patterns. On 
the other hand, for the general comparison of the software, we measured 
the  time  each  software  spent  on  analyzing  the  entire  target  dataset 
(32,640 recordings).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The context does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning, it can be inferred that the data might have been randomly divided into these subsets. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-30% is further divided between testing and validation sets. This division allows the model to learn from the majority of the data during training, while also providing separate datasets for tuning hyperparameters and assessing the final model's performance.
