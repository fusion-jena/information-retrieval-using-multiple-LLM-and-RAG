Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  the  subsequent  sections,  we  assess  model  performance  in  the 
context of model complexity and explainability, crop specific training 
against  generalized  training,  and  contrast  remote  sensing  and  meteo-
rological measurements to provide predictive performance for several 
potential use cases. 

3.1. Model complexity 

The management of model complexity is an important consideration 
in  data-driven  model  development (Jolliffe,  1986; Wang  et  al.,  2017; 
Yates  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  study  we  define  model  complexity  as  the 
number of variables included in the predictor set. Proper selection of 
variables, i.e. feature selection, can minimize training costs, measure-
ment  requirements,  and  decrease  the  likelihood  of  overfitting  (Banks 
and Fienberg, 2003; Cawley and Talbot, 2010).

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The given context does not mention any details about the deployment platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model with the provided information.
