Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some clues about the tools and techniques employed during the development and testing phases.

In this study, the researchers used the HRNet model for semantic segmentation tasks due to its high accuracy and stability. They also mentioned employing the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework for determining the sentiment index after conducting comparative analyses between different models such as Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Furthermore, they utilized the pre-trained ERNIE model from GitHub (<https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE>) for their experiments. Although there are no explicit details regarding the deployment process, one could infer that the researchers might have serialized the trained models into appropriate formats (like.h5 or.onnx files) before integrating them into a suitable platform for real-world applications.

As for the platform selection, since the researchers performed their experiments using PyCharm software and graphics processing software for proofreading, it is possible that they deployed the trained models onto platforms compatible with these environments. Nonetheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
