In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

Recurrent architectures are not the only means for capturing time 
dependencies effectively. In recent years, Transformer-based architec-
tures  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017)  have  led  to  remarkable  successes  in 
numerous applications - besides natural language processing (Jaderberg 
et al., 2015; Meinhardt et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021), including vision 
tasks (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Since transformers are not conceived in 
a  sequential manner, they exhibit multiple advantages over  recurrent 
architectures, including a more direct gradient flow, a higher level of 
parallelizability  (Zeyer  et  al.,  2019)  and  allowing  for  effective  self- 
supervised pre-training schemes (Devlin et al., 2018). In our efforts to 
use  a  Transformer  version  for  video  prediction,  similar  to  Liu  et  al. 
(2020),  we  encountered  significant  memory  limitations  even  after 
decreasing the hidden channel dimension and resorting only to single

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the authors resorted to purely deterministic variants of certain architectures. However, it does not explicitly state what specific types of architectures were used. It can be inferred from the context that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) might have been considered due to their effectiveness in capturing time dependencies. Furthermore, the mention of Transformer-based architectures suggests that these could also have been part of the pipeline. Unfortunately, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated which specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
