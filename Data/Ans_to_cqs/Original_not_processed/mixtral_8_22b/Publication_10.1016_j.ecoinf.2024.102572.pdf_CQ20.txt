research center. The Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in 
Python is used to retrieve the necessary picture data for forest fire point 
information  in  the  study  area.  The  obtained  data  is  saved  in  “CSV” 
format on Google Drive for later examination. Data is stored on Google 
Drive in CSV format to aid with further calculations.

resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).
