structures (e.g., roads and buildings) and water from slowing down the 
classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

4.3. Model development 

We developed a random forest (RF) binary classification model to 
identify  iceplant  within  Santa  Barbara  County  coast  vegetation.  The 
model was then used to perform a per-pixel analysis of all NAIP scenes 
from 2020 over this region (Section 4.4). A RF classifier is a supervised 
classifier that uses a set of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to 
make a prediction (Breiman, 2001). Each tree in the RF is created using a 
subset of the training data randomly sampled with replacement. A user- 
defined number of features is randomly selected from the data’s features 
to grow the tree at each splitting node. After all trees in the RF have been 
trained, the classification of a new data sample comes from averaging 
the class assignment probabilities for the sample produced by all trees in 
the forest.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for binary classification. Specifically, a Random Forest (RF) binary classification model was developed to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation. This model was then used to perform a per-pixel analysis of all NAIP scenes from 2020 over this region. Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model appears to be classification, specifically identifying the presence or absence of iceplant in a given area.
