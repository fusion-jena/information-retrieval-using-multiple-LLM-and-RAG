of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

While  adopting  deep  learning  techniques  in  remote  sensing  has 
surged, providing novel solutions to complex problems and the devel-
opment of model validation frameworks has lagged, creating a gap in the 
reliability  of  these  advanced  models  (Filippelli  et  al.,  2024).  Deep 
learning models, including CNN architectures and traditional machine 
learning models, frequently underperform in predicting species presence 
or  coverage  in  previously  unconsidered  areas.  This  limitation,  often 
referred  to  as  the  model's  inability  to  generalize  or  transfer  learned 
patterns to new contexts (transfer learning), becomes particularly pro-
nounced in diverse landscapes characterized by significant variations in 
terrain  and  spectral properties  (Barela  et  al., 2021; Kattenborn et  al., 
2022;  Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  The  complex  nature  of  these  het-
erogeneous  environments  poses  significant  challenges  for  model  vali-

dation,  requiring  the  development  of  more  robust  and  adaptive 
validation criteria and methods that can keep pace with the rapid ad-
vances in deep learning methods. For example, the spatial heterogeneity 
in  the  foothills  is  associated  with  variability  in  bare  soil  cover,  tree 
height  and  structural composition,  and  large  gradients  of  macro- and 
micro-topography. These topographic landscape features can drastically 
alter species composition and richness in the area (Lopatin et al., 2015, 
2016). All these spectral, structural, and topographic variabilities can 
limit the applicability of the models to new values outside the training 
samples. Thus, the ability of predictive models to generalize and accu-
rately  apply  insights  to  new  locations  beyond  the  original  dataset 
(training, validation, and test data) is crucial for the operational con-
sistency (Chadwick et al., 2024). This requirement highlights the critical

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing data, which suggests that various types of sensors might be employed to gather this data. Additionally, the context refers to studies utilizing LiDAR data, indicating the potential use of Light Detection and Ranging technology for data collection. Furthermore, references to terrain and spectral properties suggest that satellite imagery could also serve as a source of raw data. Lastly, the mention of public datasets implies that existing databases containing relevant information might be accessed during the data gathering process.
