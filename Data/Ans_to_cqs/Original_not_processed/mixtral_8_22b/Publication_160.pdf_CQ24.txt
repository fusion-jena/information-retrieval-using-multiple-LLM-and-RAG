with batch size 512 (65.54; see Table 2). These results provide a dif-
ferent perspective than the conclusions drawn by previous studies
(Masters and Luschi, 2018; Mishkin et al., 2016) where the use of small
or even mini-batches enhanced performances. This could be explained
by the high imbalance between classes and the fine-grained nature of
the classification task. Larger batches may therefore be more re-
presentative of the intra-class variability which in turn allows the net-
work to focus on inter-class variance. It will be asserted that our best
ResNet18 (ResNet18–224; 65.94 micro-F1, see Table 3) easily out-
performed deeper network architectures, whether trained from scratch
with a smaller batch size (ResNet50–128; micro-F1 63.89), or pre-
trained with fine-tuned weights (ResNet152–224; 60.09 micro-F1) ac-
cording to standard procedures (King et al., 2018). Our results support
the findings of a recent study which advocated the use of carefully

contextual information. If the patch size is too small, it contains in-
sufficient information and most probably fails to capture whole in-
dividuals; if it is too large, the context scrambles the signature of the
central information, confusing the algorithm. The patch size 64 × 64
pixels performed the worst out of all the metrics; the large differences
between validation and test performances was indicative of its poor
capacity for generalization. A patch size of 224 × 224 gave the highest
micro-F1 on the test set (65.94). This patch size included enough con-
textual noise to regularize overfitting, and it enabled better general-
ization. While the single RestNet18 based on the patch size 224 × 224
obtained the best accuracy, our ensemble network, which was based on
the four tested patch sizes and followed the feature extraction scheme
improved classification

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are some implicit clues about how the authors might have approached this issue. For instance, they discuss using larger batch sizes, which can help reduce the impact of random initialization and improve model stability. They also emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate patch sizes to balance capturing sufficient context without overwhelming the central information. Additionally, their use of ensembles suggests a strategy to mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models. Nonetheless, these observations are speculative, and the document does not directly address the management of random seeds or other sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
