Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based on the given context.
