Regarding the relevance of finding automatic FAIRness evaluation 
tools that can respond to the needs and demands associated with FAIR 
research data, we found some studies in which such tools, including the 
F-UJI, have been used (Peters-Von Gehlen et al., 2022; Sofi-Mahmudi 
and Raittio, 2022; Sun et al., 2022). In these studies, FAIRness evalua-
tion tools have been used to test a small number of datasets on a specific 
topic  (Sofi-Mahmudi  and  Raittio,  2022)  or  at  a  generic  level  without 
focusing on a specific area (Peters-Von Gehlen et al., 2022; Sun et al., 
2022). However, the following research gaps have been identified:  

1.  Studies that have jointly addressed FAIR principles and agriculture 
or  related  areas  focus  on  very  specific  examples  are  difficult  to 
replicate or extrapolate to other contexts.

store and disseminate a genomic data archive that complies with FAIR 
principles  in  terms  of  metadata  traceability  and  dataset  citability,  in 
accordance with Open Science  recommendations. Another example is 
the work of Wise et al. (2019) on the benefits of FAIR for research and 
development in the biopharmaceutical industry and other life sciences, 
such  as  biomedical,  environmental,  agricultural,  and  food  sciences. 
According to these studies, industry investment in following the FAIR 
principles could be a differentiating factor with respect to how data are 
exploited both internally and externally by other actors. Additionally, 
one line of research that promotes the advantages of FAIR principles and 
highlighted the shortcomings pertaining to their application is the work 
of Kinkade and Shepherd (2021) on the publication of geoscience data. 
Among  the  primary  conclusions  of  these  authors  are  claims  that  the

3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide information about common methods used to handle data imbalance and bias in machine learning models. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to maintain the original distribution. This technique helps ensure that minority classes are adequately represented in the training set.

Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing instances or generating synthetic ones. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular method for creating new samples based on interpolation between neighboring points.

Undersampling reduces the size of majority classes by removing instances until they match the size of minority classes. Random under-sampling removes random instances from the majority class, while informed under-sampling selectively eliminates redundant or noisy instances.

Collecting diverse data aims to improve model performance by incorporating various sources, demographics, and perspectives. This approach can help mitigate biases introduced by limited or homogeneous datasets.
