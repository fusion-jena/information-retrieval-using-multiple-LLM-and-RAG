The Acoustic Complexity Index (ACIft) was proposed by Pieretti et al. (2011). It is based on the biological hypothesis that many biotic sounds have 
intrinsic variability in their frequency bands, in contrast to anthropophonic noise that tends to be constant, such as car and airplane traffic. It was 
initially proposed to quantify bird calls since they present significant intensity variations in the vocalization frequencies. However, its use has been 
extended to different tasks, such as analyzing habitat quality, communities, and the richness of various species (Buxton et al., 2018).

Appendix C. Site: S2 

C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.
