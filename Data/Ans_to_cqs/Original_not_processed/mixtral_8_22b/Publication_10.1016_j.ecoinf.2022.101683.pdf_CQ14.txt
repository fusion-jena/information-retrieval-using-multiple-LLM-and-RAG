kernel range). The threshold used was the 10th percentile training presence. For each metric the best model is highlighted in bold where higher was better for AUC, TPR, TSS and Kappa and lower better for Omission.

suggests convergence on the maximum test sensitivity plus specificity 
(TSSmax) as the single most appropriate threshold (Guisan et al., 2017). 
However, in this case we used two different test data sets and thus two 
different  thresholds  would  have  been  generated  making  each  non- 
comparable to the other. Thus, in this case we used the 10th percen-
tile training presence (Elith et al., 2010) which was the same across both 
test datasets allowing model evaluation metrics to be directly compared.

sampling  effort  e.g.,  some  species  records  were  sourced  from  surveys 
that  recorded absence  in  addition  to  presence-only incidental  records 
from the public. All records were combined to create a bias grid (using 
the previous upweighted area combined with a weighted distribution of 
occurrences), calculated using the Gaussian function:

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I do not know the method used for hyperparameter optimization, whether it was through grid search, random search, or another method.
