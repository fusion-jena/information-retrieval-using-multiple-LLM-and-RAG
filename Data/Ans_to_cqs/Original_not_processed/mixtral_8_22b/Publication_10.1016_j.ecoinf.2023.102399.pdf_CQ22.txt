W ± STD is the body weight ± standard deviation; RMSE is root mean square 
error; MRE is mean relative error.

fish leads to greater errors in weight estimation. Consequently, the use of 
a deep learning network for high-quality target detection proved crucial 
in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment. Using 
fish body area as a parameter to estimate body weight resulted in higher 
accuracy with a MRE of 3.44% (Shi et al., 2022). However, a consid-
erable  amount  of  image  processing  work,  including  segmentation, 
erosion, and angle correction, led to a decline in the efficiency of body 
weight estimation. Therefore, the proposed method for fully automatic 
biomass  estimation  had  minimized  the  workload  and  complexity  of 
image preprocessing, thereby increasing the efficiency and robustness of 
body weight estimation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as estimated weight, estimated efficiency per minute, identified accuracy percentage, and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, parameters like W ± STD (body weight ± standard deviation) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) are also used. For instance, the table shows that the estimated weights range from 457.82 ± 63.46 to 483.98 ± 108.09 grams, while the estimated efficiencies vary from 2.79 to 17.11 per minute. Furthermore, the identified accuracies range from 83.33% to 94.44%, indicating the effectiveness of the model. Lastly, the RMSE values range from 11.83 to 18.7 grams, and the MRE ranges from 2.15% to 4.14%. These metrics help assess the overall performance of the deep learning model.
