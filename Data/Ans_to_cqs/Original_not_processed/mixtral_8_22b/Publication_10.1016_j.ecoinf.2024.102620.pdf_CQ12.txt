The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The PLUS model does not appear to use any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique, to obtain development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. Therefore, no specific deep learning model is mentioned in the given context.
