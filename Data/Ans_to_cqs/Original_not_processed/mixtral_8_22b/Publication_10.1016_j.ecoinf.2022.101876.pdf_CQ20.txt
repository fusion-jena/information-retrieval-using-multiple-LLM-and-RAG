formance which is likely to continue to improve as more training data 
are  made  available  and  new  model  advancements  are  evaluated  and 
modified. We encourage prospective AI users to carry out similar eval-
uations as performed in this study to gain more relevant information on 
model performance specific to their study systems. However, we antic-
ipate the minimum detection size limits we identified are more gener-
alizable to different study systems provided the model is well trained on 
a particular object class (i.e., under ideal conditions, MegaDetector is 
likely to detect animals when they occupy at least 60px in an image) 
(Fig. 3). Other image characteristics such as complex vegetation, poor 
lighting, low image resolution, and unique camera angles are likely to 
decrease  MegaDetector's  overall  performance  (Beery  et  al.,  2018; 
Greenberg, 2020a).

Network (Faster R-CNN) which first seeks to identify all regions in an 
image  that  contain  an  object  and  then  examines  attributes  of  those 
specific regions to assign objects to a particular class (Ren et al., 2015). 
In other words, the model first searches the image to determine areas 
that  contain  an  object  not  part  of  the  background  scene  and  draws 
bounding boxes around those objects. Then, each object is reviewed and 
assigned  an  object  classification  and  confidence  value  indicating  the 
model's confidence in the selected object class. MegaDetector has been 
trained  using  hundreds  of  thousands  of  images  labeled  by  manual 
human review from a wide variety of ecosystems and classifies objects as 
either an animal (any non-human animal), human (any person), or truck 
(any vehicle) (Beery et al., 2019; Microsoft and for Earth., 2020). This 
two-step  process  of  Faster  R-CNNs  leads  to  slower  processing  speeds

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that MegaDetector can process approximately 3.8 million images per day using specialized hardware and distributing the workload over many processors, specifically 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. While this information refers to the hardware used during the application of the model rather than its training, it suggests that GPU resources were likely involved in both stages due to the computational demands of deep learning models like MegaDetector.
