Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As  ML-techniques  become  more  pervasive  in  the  field  of  remote 
wildlife monitoring, further study of how ML model performance im-
pacts their utility could become increasingly important. Several open- 
source  species-level  classification  models  have  recently  been  released 
(B¨ohner et al., 2022; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Tabak 
et al., 2020; Tabak et al., 2022; Vecvanags et al., 2022; Whytock et al., 
2021) which can similarly be used in tandem with human tagging to 
improve tagging efficiency (Willi et al., 2019). Yet, species-level classi-
fication models can also be geographically constrained and underper-
form when applied on “out-of-sample” data from locations or in contexts 
that differ from the original training data (Tabak et al., 2019). Under-
standing the role of model performance on tagging efficiency for species- 
detection could prove useful in determining in what circumstances these 
models are effective.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to machine learning techniques for remote wildlife monitoring and species-level classification models. To find the relevant code repositories, one would need to search for them separately based on the authors and publications mentioned in the text. For instance, searching for "Boehner et al., 2022" or "Norouzzadeh et al., 2018" along with keywords like "GitHub," "code repository," or "pipeline" might yield results. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository links.
