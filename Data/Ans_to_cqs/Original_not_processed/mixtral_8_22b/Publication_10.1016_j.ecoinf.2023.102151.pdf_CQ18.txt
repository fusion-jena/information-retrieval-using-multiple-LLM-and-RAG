specific projects often require detailed soil information from a particular 
site,  delving  below  the  soil  surface  and  taking  into  account  varying 
depths. Technicians typically gather this information through soil sur-
veys and present it as raw data to professionals. However, this format 
can  create  challenges  in  effectively  communicating  and  collaborating 
across  disciplines.  Various  research  efforts  have  made  strides  in 
addressing these concerns: Yang et al. (2022) developed a framework for 
the  preliminary  delineation  of  soil  profile  horizons;  Alqadad  et  al. 
(2017)  documented  several  accidents that occurred  during urban  soil 
investigation  due  to  outdated  soil  profile  information;  Temme  and 
Vanwalleghem (2016) introduced a new model linking landscape and 
soil profile evolution based on sensitivity analysis; Pourabdollah et al. 
(2012)  proposed  a  data  exchange  schema  for  soil  and  terrain  data;

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided sources do not directly address the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. The given references primarily focus on topics such as principles of irrigation scheduling, understanding soil water thresholds, visualizing water quality models, designing gardens without irrigation, modeling olive trees, evaluating landscapes, imaging root growth processes, exchanging soil and terrain data, estimating solar radiation and evapotranspiration, automatic metro map layout, and linking landscape and soil profile evolution. To provide an accurate response regarding monitoring model performance during training, additional resources or context would be required.
