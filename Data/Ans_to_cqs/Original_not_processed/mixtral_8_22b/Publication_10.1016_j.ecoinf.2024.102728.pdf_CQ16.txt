Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

classification is described as:

∑

32
l1s=1

∑
c

0

/

[l3 ∈ l1]*1

c

(12)

Where l1l3a is the average of all l3 capture values in l1 classes, l1s is
the l1 class number (1(cid:0) 32), c is the number of captured l1 classes by l3
classification. The lower-level classification (l3) is represented as an
element (∈) of the higher-level classification (l1). Next, all l1 classes
were sorted according to MI & LI, placed in l2 bins, and all l1l3a values
were averaged again within each l2 bin (Eq. 13). The bins represent the
l2 classes (n = 6) in MI and LI areas and are l2-oriented so that results can
be applied to landscape ecology. The l1 classes not skewed to either MI
or LI areas are included for both MI and LI bins as LTA (cid:0) LU0. Sorting
and averaging is represented as:

LTA(cid:0) LU=0

2.3. NHC methodology description

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any specific details about a machine learning model being trained. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
