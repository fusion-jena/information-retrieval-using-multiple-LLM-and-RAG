2.1. Data filtering

using 

The  first  step  (data  filtering)  involves  data  acquisition  and  masks 
application  (Fig.  1).  From  the  EECE,  users  can  retrieve  the  EOS  data 
catalogue  from  the  GEE  online  repository  (https://developers.google. 
com/earth-engine/datasets/),

constructor. Constructor arguments must also be included, such as fil-
terDate, which limits the collection to a selected period, and the inner 
clip function that cuts it within a specific study area extent. The identi-
fied  public  image  series  (time  series)  may  be  preprocessed,  but  also 
undergo the previously mentioned QA bands-based masking processes 
for each satellite, through optionally implementable masking functions

environmental  data  to  ecological  processes  (Chave,  2013;  Pettorelli 
et al., 2014).

Flexible data scaling is challenging not only because data may sub-
stantially differ across sensors in terms of spatial and temporal charac-
teristics, but also because EOS data acquisition often includes hundreds 
or even thousands of scenes to process. Despite the promising possibility 
to  collect  multi-sensor  multi-temporal  time  series  spanning  decades, 
sequential process steps of such EOS big data are only possible through 
advanced frameworks and enhanced computational power (Ma et al., 
2015). In this direction, online data repositories and cloud computing 
platforms  (e.g.  Google  Earth  Engine;  GEE;  Gorelick  et  al.,  2017)  are 
progressively  providing  a  compelling  solution,  given  their  ever- 
increasing  capacity  to  store  data  from  multiple  satellites,  combined 
with big data fast computation (Gorelick et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2015). In 
particular,  the  GEE  platform  has  witnessed  a  significant  increase  in

Helpful Answer:

I apologize for any confusion, but based on the provided context, there doesn't seem to be information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the context discusses data filtering and processing using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for environmental data analysis. It mentions retrieving data catalogues from the GEE online repository, applying filters like date range and geographical clipping, and preprocessing the identified image series. Additionally, it highlights challenges related to flexible data scaling due to differences in sensor characteristics and large volumes of data, and how platforms like GEE provide solutions with their storage and computational capabilities. However, without further context, I cannot provide details on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
