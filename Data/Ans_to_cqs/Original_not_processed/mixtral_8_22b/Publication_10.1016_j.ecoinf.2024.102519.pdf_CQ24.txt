GA was first proposed by John Holland in the United States in the 
1970s  (Holland  et  al.,  1975).  It  is  an  iterative  adaptive  probabilistic 
search  method  based  on  the natural  selection  principle  and a  natural 
genetic  mechanism  that  simulates  the  development  law  of  biological 
evolution in nature (Deng et al., 2023). The optimization process begins 
with a set of random solutions, also known as a “population.” Each in-
dividual in the population is a solution, and the quality of the individual 
solution  is  determined  by  the  fitness  function’s  evaluation  of  the 
“fitness.” Individuals with high fitness have strong adaptability and high 
survival  probability.  The  parent  generates  the  offspring  population 
through GA operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, and 
the global optimal solution is found through repeated iterations.

The  operation  of  GA  requires  specifying  the  “initial  population” 
(Pop),  and  the  selection  of  the  “population”  size  will  affect  the  algo-
rithm’s performance and convergence speed. A larger population size 
can increase the diversity of algorithms, which helps explore the search 
space more comprehensively but also increases computational costs. A 
smaller population size may cause the algorithm to fall into local optima; 
however, the computational cost is lower. After multiple attempts, we 
obtained  the  ecological  source  locations  under  different  initial  pop-
ulations  and  compared  the  source  area  coverage,  average  source 
coverage,  and  source  fragmentation  to  determine  whether  an  initial 
population of Pop = 50 was the best choice. The comparative results of 
the ESA for the different populations are shown in Table 7 and Fig. 7. 
The connectivity rate of the source area reached 84.99%. The coverage

mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to fix the random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility across experiments since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time.

2. Multiple Runs: To account for variability due to random initialization, it is recommended to perform multiple runs using different random seeds. This allows for averaging out the effects of randomness and obtaining a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Another strategy is to use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. By splitting the dataset into several folds and repeating the experiment multiple times, this technique reduces the impact of randomness on the final result.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can help improve overall performance and reduce variance caused by randomness.
