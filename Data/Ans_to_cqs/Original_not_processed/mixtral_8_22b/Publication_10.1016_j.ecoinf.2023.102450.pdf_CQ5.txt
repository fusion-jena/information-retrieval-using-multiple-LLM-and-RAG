The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the

train a Siamese network using fewer samples, resulting in high accuracy. 
As the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, we 
used  the  few-shot  learning  method  to  train  the  network.  Herein,  the 
classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the 
training  set  contained  N  different  categories  with  each  category 
comprising K labeled samples. Two categories were defined during the 
training  of  the  tracking  tasks:  target  and  non-target.  Based  on  the 
training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments were performed using 
two-way one-shot learning(Cheng et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is unclear which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is mention of a custom dataset containing three classes: circular curves, straight lines, and 8-shaped curves. This dataset consists of 10, 22, and 10 videos respectively, with durations of 927s, 1374s, and 678s. Each video contains 27,819, 41,225, and 20,340 images respectively. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a few-shot learning method due to an insufficient number of samples in the training dataset. Unfortunately, no other well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
