Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

included two convolutional layers and two pooling layers (Table 2; https://doi.org/10.6084/
m9.ﬁgshare.5501716). The code used to deﬁne and train these CNNs can be found in our
Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4).

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study involves applications of deep convolutional neural networks to digitized natural images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset might consist of digitized natural images, possibly from a collection or database related to natural history collections (NHCs), given the focus on supporting public health, safety, and agriculture, as well as understanding biodiversity and studying various aspects such as evolution, habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the dataset, we cannot definitively state which specific dataset was used in this case.
