Furthermore, Chou et al. (2018) demonstrated a machine learning 
method for evaluating the water quality in reservoirs, highlighting the 
ANNs model's accuracy while expressing worries about its scalability. 
Our study presents a customized paradigm for water pollution analysis 
in aquaculture, building on previous efforts. The AODEGRU model of-
fers increased accuracy and efficiency while addressing scaling issues. 
The  use  of  deep  learning  models  for  classifying  water  pollution  in 
aquaculture is still developing, despite its potential in several domains 
(Arepalli and Naik, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c; Zhang et al., 2021; Haq and 
Harigovindan,  2022).  Current  deep  learning  models  face  difficulties 
including inconsistent data, interpretability constraints, and poor per-
formance in this setting. To address this, we provide a novel attention 
based AODEGRU model in our study, which deviates greatly from pre-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding a penalty term to the loss function or modifying the network architecture. Two common regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. This helps improve generalization performance on unseen data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of weights as a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, while data augmentation generates additional training samples through transformations like rotation, zooming, etc. Batch normalization standardizes inputs within a layer, reducing internal covariance shift and improving convergence speed. These methods can be combined to achieve better results.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention any specific regularization method used in their proposed AODEGRU model. However, considering the prevalence of these techniques in deep learning research, it would be reasonable to assume that some form of regularization was employed to prevent overfitting. Without further information, one cannot definitively state which regularization methods were utilized in this particular case.
