The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes  the  weakly-supervised  database  and  proposes  two  DNN  struc-
tures  as  a  novel  solution  to  the  problem  of  fish  detection  in  turbid 
waters. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models, compare them 
with each other, and with the other fully-supervised models in Section 3. 
A  detailed  discussion  of  our  findings  is  carried  out  in  Section  4.  The 
paper is concluded in Section 5. 

2. Material and methods 

This section starts by describing our labeled dataset and then pro-
ceeds by proposing two DNN models to enhance the capability of marine 
scientists in turbid underwater and coastal environment monitoring. 

2.1. Weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset

1.  Collecting and presenting a new fish dataset in turbid waters.  
2.  Weakly  labelling  this  dataset  to  provide  the  world’s  first  weakly 

labeled fish dataset in turbid waters.  

3.  Developing two novel deep learning models to achieve two different 

goals.  
a.  A  semi-supervised  model  for  accelerating  model  development 

speed from data collection to deployment.  

b.  A  weakly-supervised  model  for  accelerating  the  development 
time,  while  also  conserving  the  accuracy,  compared  to  the  fast 
semi-supervised model.

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  typical  operation  of  fully-supervised 
models  in  Table  3  is  extracted  from  a  recent  survey  paper  by  Saleh 
et  al.  (2022b),  which  is  mainly  focused  on  clear-water  scenarios. 
Therefore, a more accurate comparison between our semi- and weakly- 
supervised models with a fully-supervised deep learning in both clear 
and turbid waters is required. We believe that applying the clear-water 
models of Saleh et al. (2022b) in turbid water situations (like our Fish-
InTurbidWater dataset) would dramatically degrade their performance. 
Besides,  the  approximate  turnaround  time  in  Table  3  is  measured 
against a non-experienced human agent. Here, we added an extra 30% 
to  the  labeling  time  of  fully-supervised  networks  to  consider  the 
necessary  double-checks  and  quality  controls.  Overall,  these  numbers 
are only rough estimates of the required time, and they heavily depend

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors have evaluated the accuracy of the proposed models and compared them with each other and with other fully-supervised models. This suggests that some form of performance evaluation was conducted during or after the training process. Additionally, the use of a semi-supervised model for accelerating model development speed and a weakly-supervised model for balancing development time and accuracy implies that the authors were concerned about the efficiency and effectiveness of their models. Therefore, it can be assumed that some sort of performance monitoring strategy was likely employed during the training phase, although the exact details are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
