As shown in Tables 4–6, the AE has the shortest running time and the poorest clas-
siﬁcation results compared with the other two models. The AE consists of only a single
Autoencoder, but only one Autoencoder cannot learn the deep features of DNA barcode se-
quences well, resulting in poor classiﬁcation results compared with deep learning methods.
Although the ESK time consumption is longer than AE, the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score
improved for all datasets, by 8.44%, 8.77%, and 4.84%, respectively.

Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

97.57%, 97.43%, and 98.96% on average. The main contributions of our paper are as follows:

In addition, Table 4 illustrates the detailed data corresponding to Figure 5. The
accuracy, recall, and F1-Score on Mugilidae increased by approximately 4.98%, 5.24%, and
2.78%, respectively. Similarly, under the same conditions, the performance measures also
increased in other two datasets. Those results indicate that add Elastic Net can improve
the classiﬁcation performance of the ESK.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of correctly identifying positive instances, false positives, and false negatives. For instance, in this study, the accuracy, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the performance of the proposed model. The accuracy metric indicates the proportion of correct predictions made out of total predictions. On the other hand, recall measures the true positive rate or sensitivity, i.e., the number of relevant instances retrieved divided by the total number of relevant instances. Lastly, the F1-score combines both precision and recall to give a balanced view of the model's performance. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
