points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

5. Discussion 

5.1. The multi-scenario setting helps construct spatially balanced ESPs

4.4.3. Ecological barriers 

Based on the characteristics of each scenario, the search radius for 
ecological  barriers  was  set  as  follows.  A  search  radius  of  320  m  was 
established in Scenario A by computing the total area of cropland and 
the  accompanying  cropland  pressure  index  for  each  sub-district  in 
Guangzhou. Based on pertinent planning documents, the search radius 
was set to 200 m for Scenario B and 500 m for Scenario C. 

Six barriers were identified in Scenario A, where the land-use type 
was dominated by water bodies (Fig. 6c), mainly located in the south-
