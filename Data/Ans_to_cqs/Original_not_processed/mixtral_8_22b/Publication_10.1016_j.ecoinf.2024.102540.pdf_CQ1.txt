Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

Usually,  growers  or  entomologists  manually  monitor  pests  using 
morphology keys, pest guides, and images to match key characteristics 
with  common  genera  and  species  names  reported  in  the  literature 
(Bishop and Hutchings, 2011). However, using machine learning, and 
specifically, deep learning approaches, has the potential to expedite this 
important component to the monitoring process by automating several 
tasks using imagery (Grijalva et al., 2023a; Grijalva et al., 2023b; Wang 
et al., 2023). Species detection and classification of organisms found in 
production sorghum fields are common tasks during standard scouting 
events  or  bouts.  Machine  learning  can  automate  these  tasks  with  the 
slightest  use  of  labor  and  time  (Chen  et  al.,  2021).  Many  traditional 
machine  learning  algorithms  have  been  used  to  classify  pests;  these 
include  the  Normal  Bayes  classifier  (a.k.a.,  Naïve  Bayes  classifier),  K

A CNN is a deep neural network that can be used to process any data 
with  a  grid  pattern,  including imagery  data  (Yamashita et  al., 2018). 
Deep neural networks, particularly CNNs, have been successfully used 
for pattern recognition in a diverse range of insect images because of 
their higher performance in detection and classification tasks compared 
to traditional machine learning approaches (Hansen et al., 2020; Motta 
et al., 2020; O'Shea and Nash, 2015). CNNs perform mathematical op-
erations focusing on convolution operations, which is a linear operation 
that  can  extract  image  features  useful  for  detection  and  classification 
tasks (Yamashita et al., 2018). The use of CNNs to identify species is 
rapidly growing in entomology (Høye et al., 2021). Different tasks, such 
as  manual  identification and  counting, can be  performed  using CNNs 
and potentially aid or even replace humans in key scouting activities. To

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses imagery data, specifically images of insects and diseases on plants. It also refers to the use of large image datasets to train deep neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). From this, we can infer that the raw data collection method likely involves capturing images of the target subjects, possibly through digital cameras or other imaging devices. Additionally, the mention of leveraging large image datasets suggests that publicly available datasets might also be used as part of the data collection process. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the context, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
