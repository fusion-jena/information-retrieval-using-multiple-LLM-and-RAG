This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN. 

5. Conclusions

The total area of soil degradation on HN reached 673.69 km2 in 2020 
(mainly concentrated in the northeastern region). Among the different 
land-use types, forest had the largest degraded area (439.88 km2), fol-
lowed by cultivated land (184.06 km2), construction land (25.44 km2), 
grassland (22.56 km2), and unutilized land (1.75 km2). The DEM, LDP, 
and VTem were the dominant influences on soil degradation in culti-
vated land and grassland, forest, and construction land, respectively. In 
addition,  DEM∩LDR,  LDP∩LDR, and  VTem∩VGDP  were  the  most  sig-
nificant interactive pairs influencing soil degradation in cultivated land 
and  grassland,  forest,  grassland,  and  construction  land.  The  DEM, 
especially when paired with LDR and LDP, hastens vegetation and soil 
degradation  on  cultivated  land  and  grassland.  To  protect  the  soil  re-
sources of HN, ecological protection zones should be expanded to pro-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the input data is suitable for the model. These steps can include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: This involves transforming the data so that it falls within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale.

2. Cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting errors, outliers, missing values, or irrelevant features in the dataset. It ensures that the model learns from accurate and relevant information.

3. Feature Selection: This process involves selecting the most important features that contribute significantly to the output variable. Reducing the number of features can help reduce overfitting and improve computational efficiency.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models require numerical inputs. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: This technique is used to increase the amount of training data by applying random (but realistic) transformations to existing images, such as rotation, zooming, shifting, etc. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize.
