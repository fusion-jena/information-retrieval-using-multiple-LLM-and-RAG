To address these problems, we propose SDP-EPL, a novel invasive 
Species Distribution Prediction scheme based on the Ensemble teacher 
model  to  incrementally  generate  Pseudo-Labels.  We  first  establish  an 
ensemble-based  teacher  model  with  various  conventional  SDMs, 
including ANN, RF, GBM, XGB, and LGBM, using an initial training set 
with  very  few  labeled  data  points.  We  then  incrementally  build  the 
training set by repeatedly performing the following steps: (i) generating 
pseudo-labels for unlabeled data using the teacher model, (ii) selecting 
pseudo-labeled  data  representing  high  or  low  habitat  suitability  and 
adding  them  to  the  training  set,  and  (iii)  training  the  teacher  model 
using the expanded training set. Finally, we train a student SDM using 
the final training set consisting of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. To 
demonstrate the effectiveness of SDP-EPL in situations where observa-

et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacher–student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among
