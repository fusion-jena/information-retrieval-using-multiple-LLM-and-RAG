The XGBoost model does not have an analytical form and is obtained 
through numerical optimization of the error function in successive it-
erations. According to specific criteria, the algorithm takes the form of a 
so-called  ensemble  model  and  is  based  on  regression  decision  trees 
(CART)  that  partition  the  example  space  using  a  divide-and-conquer 
method, aiming to introduce maximum order to the data. The training 
(spectral-vegetation  indices  referring  to  Table  2)  and  validation 
(ground-based  Fv/Fm  measurements)  sets  were  divided  in  an  80:20 
ratio. XGBoost trains a series of trees, with each subsequent tree starting 
its  learning  process  anew,  taking  into  account  the  correction  for  the 
residual values of the previous tree. The error value (residual value in 
the context of classical regression) made by each tree for each element of

2.4. Vegetation index extraction

Current  research  on  chlorophyll  fluorescence  retrieval  methods  in 
terrestrial landscapes through the Fv/Fm parameter, using traditional 
approaches, faces challenges due to seasonal ecosystem dynamics and 
variations in plant species abundance [Tan et al., 2018; Sukhova et al., 
2021]. Fv/Fm indicates the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II 
(PSII)  in  plants,  and  it  is  a  ratio  used  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  of 
photosynthesis in these organisms. The measurement of ground-based 
Fv/Fm  requires  the  use  of  a  pulse-amplitude  modulation  fluorometer 
with  active  light  sources,  conducted  in  both  dark-adapted  and  light- 
adapted  conditions,  as  outlined  in  the  Opti-Sciences  portable  system 
(OS5p+)  User  Guide  [OS5p+ Pulse  Modulated  Chlorophyll  Fluorom-
eter, 2022]. Fv/Fm serves as a measure of plant photosynthetic activity, 
with  reduced  values  possibly  indicating  stress,  photoinhibition,  and

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model were optimized. However, common techniques for hyperparameter tuning include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based optimization. These methods involve iteratively trying different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating their performance on a validation set. Without further details from the authors or the papers cited, we cannot definitively state which method was used for this particular study.
