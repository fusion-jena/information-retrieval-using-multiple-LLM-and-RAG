models, pre-trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes. First,
the intermediate layer of all the models was selected to use
for feature extraction. For this purpose, the output of the last
layer (bottleneck layer) is commonly used prior to the ﬂatten
operation. The reason is that all the fully connected layers
are specialized to the task network was trained on; thus, the
features learned by these layers will not be useful for the new
task. The bottleneck features are more generic. Therefore, the
base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the
ImageNet dataset and used as a feature extractor. We added
a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce the
overﬁtting of the model. Finally, the top classiﬁer softmax
layer was added for predicting the class for an input image.
The model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled
and optimized with Adam optimizer. The other with the base
model of MobileNetV3 were optimized with Gradient descent

D. Model Training

Feature Extraction: The hardware to train the model included
a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz
of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-
bit system. The software tools included Annaconda3 Jupyter
Notebook with Python 3.8, where the Tensorﬂow, OpenCV-
python3 [37] and Keras [38] libraries were used. The dataset
was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789
images and a test set of 1930 images. To obtain the pre-
trained weight parameters, we built the base models from the

App Development: For tree species identiﬁcation in a remote
area, an end-user app is essential. For the app development,
Android Studio [39] was used. The saved models were
converted into the TensorFlow Lite [40] version using the
TensorFlow Lite converter. TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools
to perform deep learning on smartphone and IoT devices. The
architecture of the mobile app is shown in Fig. 4. The squares
marked with dotted red will be included in future iterations.
The size of the models based on MobileNetV3-Large and
MobileNetV3-Small was 4.88 MB and 1.99 MB, respectively,
which are lightweight compared to AlexNet (227.5 MB) [27].
The app is developed using the Java programming language.
The leaf detection module in the app contains a Tensorﬂow
Lite interpreter for the TensorFlow Lite model.
App Testing: For testing the application, Android studio
comes with built-in phone emulators, or the app could be
deployed to an actual device. From an online search, we

A. Transfer Learning from Pre-trained Models

When data used to train deep learning networks is not
enough, and it is expensive to create labelled data, transfer
learning, a promising paradigm,
is applied to acquire the
knowledge learned in previous settings. The most common
strategies of transfer learning are feature extraction and ﬁne-
tuning. For feature extraction, input data is provided to the
pre-trained model, and activation values of many layers are
stored to use as features. For ﬁne-tuning, the initial layers
of the model are ﬁxed, and the ﬁnal layers of the model

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify different types of leaves. This is evident from several parts of the text, such as when it mentions adding a "top classifier softmax layer" for predicting the class for an input image, which indicates that the model is intended for classification purposes. Additionally, the mention of dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set further supports this conclusion, as this is a common practice in supervised machine learning tasks like classification.
