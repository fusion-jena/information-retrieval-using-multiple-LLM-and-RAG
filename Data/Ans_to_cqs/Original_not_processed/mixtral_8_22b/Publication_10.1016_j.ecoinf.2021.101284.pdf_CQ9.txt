of districts within the NUTS3 units. 

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study is located or made available. It only mentions that the data used in the study is of the Big Data type and its volume is in the order of terabytes in size. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available from the given context alone.
