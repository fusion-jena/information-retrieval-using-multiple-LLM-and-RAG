et  al.,  2021;  Pham  et  al.,  2021).  A  common  approach  is  to  exploit  a 
teacher–student structure in the training process, which refers to use a 
trained teacher model to teach a student model. However, in most cases, 
a single ANN or deep neural network model is used as the teacher model 
to assign labels (Ali et al., 2022; Asghar et al., 2020). When PL based on a 
single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher 
model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the 
labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions 
of  the  species  and  may  lead  to  overfitting  of  the  student  model.  In 
addition,  predictive  errors  of  a  single-teacher  model  can  accumulate 
during the training process, reducing the general efficiency of PL (Arazo 
et  al.,  2020).  This  can  be  alleviated  by  considering  different  teacher 
models for label generation and using the most promising model among

learning  (ML)-based  methods  have  been 
employed for more accurate species distribution predictions (Rew et al., 
2020;  Saranya  et  al.,  2021).  Due  to  their  ability  to  capture  complex 
spatial patterns, they exhibit superior predictive performance compared 
with traditional methods. For instance, Bellin et al. (2022) showed that 
an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer outperforms 
GLM  in  their  distribution  prediction  experiments  using  27  environ-
mental variables for two zooplankton species. In addition, several well- 
known ML methods, including the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method 
(Phillips  et  al.,  2006),  and  various  ensemble  models  such  as  random 
forest  (RF)  (Ahmed  et  al.,  2021),  gradient  boosting  machine  (GBM) 
(Marmion et al., 2009), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) (Effrosynidis 
et  al.,  2020),  and  light  GBM  (LGBM)  (Effrosynidis  and  Arampatzis,

2021), have proven their potential in predicting distributions of various 
species. However, these models require large amounts of observational 
data for the target species to learn appropriate environmental charac-
teristics. When such data are not sufficient, ML-based SDMs suffer from 
poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure 
(Gaul  et  al.,  2020;  Wisz  et  al.,  2008).  This  data  shortage  problem  is 
especially  common  for  rare  or  endangered  species,  and  for  invasive 
species in their early stages of introduction (Lomba et al., 2010; Zhang 
et al., 2020). Several strategies have been suggested to solve this prob-
lem.  Typical  examples  include  spatial  extrapolation  using  models 
trained  with  sufficient  observational  data  for  external  areas  (Farashi 
et al., 2013) and the integration of multiple observational datasets (e.g., 
citizen science dataset) collected by different sampling designs (Tehrani

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a trained teacher model, often represented as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Neural Network (DNN), is employed to guide the learning process of a student model. The term 'Artificial Neural Network' is quite broad and encompasses many types of architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs), etc. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what exact type of deep learning model was utilized in the described pipeline.
