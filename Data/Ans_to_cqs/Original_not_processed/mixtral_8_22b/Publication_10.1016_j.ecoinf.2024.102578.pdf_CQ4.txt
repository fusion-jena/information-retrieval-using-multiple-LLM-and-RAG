Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

We  used  the  keras  image_data_generator  function  for  image 
augmentation,  which  included  random  assignment  of  the  following: 
◦
rotation 0–40
, width and height shift range of 20%, shear range 0–0.2 
rad, zoom range 0–0.2 scalar range, a horizontal flip and a fill mode with 
the nearest pixel. 

We  trained  and  validated  the  image  quality  classifier  on  a  laptop 
(MacBook  Pro,  M1  Pro  8-core  central  processing  unit  (CPU),  14-core 
graphics  processing  unit  (GPU),  16GB  RAM),  using  the  GPU  rather 
than CPU for data processing. GPUs are optimized for complex imaging 
tasks and, in our case, outperform CPUs by ~7×.

shown to reduce the processing time of image classification load by as 
much as 5× to 13× depending on the tasks (Fennell et al., 2022; Henrich

2. Workflow 

The multi-step, semi-automated workflow proposed here (Fig. 1) is 
adapted from B¨ohner et al., 2023, including pre-processing of images, 
model  training,  classification,  manual  quality  checks,  and  final  data 
formatting. Specifically, we build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) 
and  Fennell  et  al.  (2022),  who  combined  MegaDetector  with  manual 
classification and custom-trained models. The workflow consists of the 
following two classification steps in addition to pre-processing of images 
and  final  manual  inspection,  quality  control,  and  data  formatting 
(Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
In this study, several data augmentation techniques were applied using the Keras image_data_generator function. These techniques include rotation within a range of 0-40 degrees, width and height shifts with a range of 20%, shearing transformation with a range of 0-0.2 radians, zooming with a range of 0-0.2 scalar values, horizontal flipping, and filling missing pixels with the nearest neighbor value. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model by artificially increasing the size of the dataset and introducing variations into it.
