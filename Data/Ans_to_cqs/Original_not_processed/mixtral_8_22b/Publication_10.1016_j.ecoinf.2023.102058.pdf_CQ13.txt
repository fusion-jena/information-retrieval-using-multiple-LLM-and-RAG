Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

intelligent  ways  of  eliminating  irrelevant  spectral  wavelengths  while 
unraveling  the  complex  relationship  between  response  and  predictor 
variables  with  limited  assumption  and  prior  knowledge  (Saberioon

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context does mention that other machine learning algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, have been applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters with improved accuracy and performance. However, no details about the specific hyperparameters used in these models are provided. It is also mentioned that artificial neural networks (ANNs) and extreme machine learning have become popular for developing semi-empirical models, but again, no information about their hyperparameters is included. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
