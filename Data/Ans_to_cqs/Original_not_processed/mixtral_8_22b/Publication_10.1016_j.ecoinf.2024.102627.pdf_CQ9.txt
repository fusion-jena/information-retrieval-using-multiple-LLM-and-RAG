where θ is the set of parameters of the neural network to be optimised by 
minimizing the loss function of Eq. (2). 

Using this very common deep learning framework, it is possible to 
show that the species assemblage predictor Sλ(x) of Eq. (1) is consistent 
λ(x) when  the

number  of  training  samples  increases.  In  other  words,  our  species 
assemblage predictor is as simple as training a deep neural network with 
a cross-entropy loss function on the presence-only samples and thresh-
olding  the  output  softmax  probabilities  to  get  the  assemblage  of  pre-
dicted species.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on standard practices in scientific research, one might expect such datasets to be made publicly accessible through repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Given that the paper mentions using GBIF data, there is a possibility that the processed data used in their study could also be shared via GBIF. Nevertheless, without specific details mentioned in the given context, we cannot definitively state where the data repository is located.
