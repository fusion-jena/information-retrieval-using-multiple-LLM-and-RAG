These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’. 

Funding

All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

4.1. Conclusions and outlook 

Given the causal relationship between valve gape and pumping rate, 
which  exists  both  for  actively  and  passively  controlled  gaping  angle

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the analysis is related to valve gaping, which is expressed as a proportion of aperture. The data is collected using sensors and recorded at 1 Hz. It is also mentioned that the data is processed using R programming language. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could be a numerical or tabular format, possibly in CSV or similar format. Additionally, since the data is collected using sensors, it might also include time series data.
