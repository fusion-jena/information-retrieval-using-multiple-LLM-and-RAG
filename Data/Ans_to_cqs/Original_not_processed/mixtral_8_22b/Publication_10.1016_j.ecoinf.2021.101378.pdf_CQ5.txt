species  in  ecosystems  including  artificial  neural  networks  (Park  and 
Chung, 2006), random forest (Lee et al., 2019; Park et al., 2013), and 
maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Hirata et al., 2017; Ikegami and 
Jenkins,  2018).  Machine  learning  methods  help  researchers  to  effec-
tively manage complex and nonlinear ecological data as a tool for data 
exploration, prediction of ecological patterns, and pattern recognition 
(Humphries et al., 2018).

We developed a dataset consisting of seven environmental variables 
(elevation,  slope, and  distance to  road as  geographical  variables, and 
annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum 
temperature in July, and annual precipitation, as meteorological vari-
ables), and the proportion of land-use types including seven categories 
(urban  area,  agriculture land,  forest,  grassland, wetland,  barren  area, 
and water). All values of dataset were extracted from digital maps using 
the geographic information system (GIS) program (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI). 
Digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National 
Geographic  Information  Institute  of  Korea  (http://www.ngii.go.kr).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that a dataset was created consisting of seven environmental variables and the proportion of land-use types including seven categories. The dataset was extracted from digital maps using the ArcGIS 10.1 program. Digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea. Therefore, the dataset used in this study is related to environmental and land-use variables rather than image datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
