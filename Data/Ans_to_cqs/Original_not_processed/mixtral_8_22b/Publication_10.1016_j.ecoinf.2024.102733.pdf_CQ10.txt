Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

the decoder is composed of layers sized 3 × 128 and 6 × 64. During the
training of this model, the network weights are iteratively updated using
the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015). Additionally, a scheduler
adjusts the learning rate: when the loss plateaus, meaning it does not
decrease over a certain number of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.

5.1.3. Autoencoder

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other
