Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

Various combinations of Pmean and Pstd values, along with typical
hyperparameters of neural networks such as learning rate, batch size,
and weight decay, were tested and explored. These values were assigned
using random generators to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of
the model's performance. The parameter ranges considered are as fol-
lows: learning rate = [0.00001, 0.001], batch size = [64, 8192], weight
decay = [0, 0.59], Pmean = [ (cid:0) 4, 1.8], and Pstd = [0.5, 1.68].

After training the proposed diffusion model in an unsupervised pre-

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

The results of the 1D-CNN, autoencoder, and the proposed method
reveal that the models trained with plain Cross-Entropy Loss consistently
achieve a lower or comparable performance in every metric. This aligns
with expectations, as both Focal Loss and SMOTE are specifically
designed to address imbalanced datasets. The models exploiting SMOTE
obtain the best performance across all metrics. On the other hand, the
features from (Beyan and Fisher, 2013a; Beyan and Fisher, 2013b)
combined with SVM yield the lowest results across all combinations.

Helpful Answer:

The paper evaluates the performance of the deep learning models using several metrics. These include Cross-Entropy Loss, Focal Loss, F1-score, and the geometric mean of true positives and negatives (G-mean). The results show that the models trained with plain Cross-Entropy Loss achieve lower or comparable performance in every metric compared to those trained with Focal Loss or SMOTE. The models exploiting SMOTE obtain the best performance across all metrics. However, the features from (Beyan and Fisher, 2013a; Beyan and Fisher, 2013b) combined with SVM yield the lowest results across all combinations.
