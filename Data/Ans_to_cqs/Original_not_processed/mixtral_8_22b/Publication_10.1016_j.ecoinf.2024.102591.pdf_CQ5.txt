2.3. Additional geospatial data 

The core search tool in FIREMAP is based on historical wildfire pe-
rimeters  (2008–2023)  of  the  RDA  module  of  EFFIS,  which  is  a  main 
component  of  the  CEMS.  This  high-quality  database  is  the  main 
harmonized data source of wildfires in the European Union (Turco et al., 
2019). EFFIS BA mapping relies on active fire detection products from 
the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and a semi-automatic 
classification  of  MODIS  red-NIR  (spatial  resolution  of  250  m)  and 
SWIR (500 m) bands. Since 2018, the RDA incorporates S2 data to map 
BA smaller than 30 ha and refining the fire scars initially mapped from 
MODIS data. The EFFIS database is currently updated twice every day,

Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

data  acquisition  and  storage,  database  management,  networking  and 
computational requirements  may  involve technical difficulties  in  pro-
cessing  frameworks  of  fire-related  geospatial  data,  especially  if  using 
moderate or high-resolution imagery. In this context, operational users 
-including land managers- can be discouraged from leveraging remote 
sensing  datasets  (Davies  et  al.,  2008;  Gorelick  et  al.,  2017;  Horning 
et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2015; Pettorelli, 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire analysis. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog, including European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) datasets over 40 years. These datasets can be readily processed using JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, while we cannot specify the exact dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, we can infer that various satellite imagery datasets from ESA and NASA are likely being utilized in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire analysis.
