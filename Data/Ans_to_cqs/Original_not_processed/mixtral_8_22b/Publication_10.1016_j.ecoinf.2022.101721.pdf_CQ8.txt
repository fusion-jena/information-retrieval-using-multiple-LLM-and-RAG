2022).  The  most  important  feature  of  the  code  is  that  all  parameters 
depend  on  important  local  conditions  which  cannot  be  ignored  (e.g. 
Russo  et  al.,  2018;  Russo  and  Jones,  2002;  Voigt  et  al.,  2021). 
Acknowledging that no study areas are the same would demand more 
from a researcher in terms of understanding the local bat fauna. ABBA 
and the R-code in supplement S1 can be used to prepare data to be used 
in  statistical  modeling,  although  the  researcher  would  have  to 
acknowledge that the species assignments are probabilities and not ab-
solutes.  Manual  species  assignments  may  be  considered  by  many  re-
searchers  as  being  absolute  IDs,  but  the  evidence  suggests  otherwise 
(Rydell  et  al.,  2017,  Montauban  et  al.,  2021,  this  study).  Hence, 
Bayesian  approximation  should  not  be  considered  inferior  to  manual 
analysis in terms of uncertainty.

full  sample  (N  = 10,000)  using  both  uninformative  and  informative 
priors through the R-code (supplement S1). The outcome is presented in 
a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

may  be  excluded  from  data  sets  more  frequently,  or  even  incorrectly

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is located. It only mentions that there is an R-code available in supplement S1, but it does not specify where this supplement can be found or if it includes a link to a code repository. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
