2. on the other hand, a practically reasonable pipeline for recognition
can be achieved despite the problem specification challenges, using a
careful examination of different factors, such as pose handling, while
bearing some surprises to the Computer Vision community, e.g., the
advantage of a feature-extraction enhancement (avoiding data
augmentation) over using augmentation techniques.

Preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a
preferred way with significantly better results, seemingly by-passing the
difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of so
few examples. It could be, however, that there is still a better way to by-
pass this difficulty but also exploit the power of augmentations.

performance of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
showed that the CNN outperforms the traditional classification methods.
Salman et al., (2016) compared traditional classification methods such
as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbours (K(cid:0) NN), and Sparse Representation
Classifier with CNN. They achieve an average classification rate of more
than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 (Joly et al., 2014) and LifeCLEF15 (Joly
et al., 2015) fish datasets using CNN and generally a significantly lower
rate using the traditional methods. Siddiqui et al., (2017) reaches clas-
sification accuracy of 94.3% performance on fish species classification
using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach for enhanced
discriminative ability to handle the limited labeled training data prob-
lem. Nepovinnykh et al., (2018) examine two methods of Saimaa ringed
seal identification based on transfer learning: retraining of an existing
convolutional neural network (CNN) versus using the CNN trained for

The training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each
having 4 different 320 × 320 pixels images. The test size included 99
other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set.
Images of both training and test sizes varied in their poses and other
image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc. The initial ex-
periments referred to the following issues to be decided for the chosen
framework:

1. Architecture: We examined two Siamese architectures versions
based on the work of (Koch et al., 2015), since Siamese networks that
learn a similarity function are a better choice for learning with a
small example set.13 The two architectures have either 2 or 4
convolution layers with Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL)
as a loss function. The implementations are taken from the open
sources of Choi, (2020); Siyah, (2020).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Siamese network, which is a specific type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network is designed to learn a similarity function, making it suitable for learning with small example sets. Two Siamese architectures were examined, one with 2 convolution layers and another with 4 convolution layers, both utilizing Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL) as a loss function.
