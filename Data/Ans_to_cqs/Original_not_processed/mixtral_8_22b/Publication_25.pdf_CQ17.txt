combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework (sensu [14]), which may improve deep
learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized
features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high
quality annotations [16]. It is unknown whether moderate to low quality annotations can be used
to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree
delimitation approaches.

The challenge for applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets.
A lack of training data is a pervasive problem in remote sensing due to the cost of data collection
and annotation [13]. In addition, the spatial extent of training data often prohibits the ﬁeld-based
veriﬁcation of annotated objects. For tree detection, the high variation in tree crown appearance, due
to taxonomy, health status, and human management, increases the risk of overﬁtting when using small
amounts of training data [10]. One approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning is
“self-supervised learning” (sensus [14]), which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data
that is used to train supervised models [15]. This approach has recently been applied to remote sensing
for hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [9]. Self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be

improve with a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples.

Helpful Answer:

In the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some strategies to address overfitting and improve deep learning performance on limited training data are discussed.

One strategy mentioned is self-supervised learning, where unsupervised methods are used to generate training data for supervised models. This method was applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification [9], but it doesn't directly involve traditional regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.

Another approach suggested is combining labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, allowing neural networks to learn generalized features on a larger set of training examples before fine-tuning on a smaller number of high-quality annotations [16]. While this technique might not explicitly use common regularization methods, it could help reduce overfitting by exposing the network to diverse training data.

Lastly, the text mentions that the difficulty of training deep architectures and the effect of unsupervised pretraining were studied [17]. Although this research does not discuss specific regularization methods, it suggests that unsupervised pretraining could potentially aid in preventing overfitting by improving the initialization of weights in deep learning models.
