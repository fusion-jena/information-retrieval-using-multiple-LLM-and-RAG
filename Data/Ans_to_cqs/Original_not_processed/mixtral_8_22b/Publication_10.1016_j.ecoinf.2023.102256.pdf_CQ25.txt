The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

Over  the  past  few  years,  deep  learning  has  revolutionized  several 
research  fields  such  as  bioinformatics  (Li  et  al.,  2020)  and  medicine 
(Piccialli et al., 2021) by enabling automated processing of large and 
complex  datasets.  Considered  a  branch  of  machine  learning,  deep 
learning refers to algorithms, commonly called deep neural networks, 
able  to  automatically  detect  very  complex  and  highly  discriminating 
patterns  in  data  (Chollet,  2018).  The  succession  of  processing  layers 
performing  linear  and  non-linear  transformations  allows  the  neural 
networks  to  learn  representations  of  data  with  multiple  levels  of 
abstraction  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015).  This  ability  makes  deep  learning 
particularly  relevant  for  solving  complex  problems  such  as  speech 
recognition, object detection, computer vision, and many other domains 
(Taigman et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012). Naturally, these practices

the network is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which 
is often the case in ecology datasets. We conducted preliminary exper-
iments  on  enhancing  deep  learning  with  metadata  using  the  Hainan 
gibbon case study and the network developed by Dufourq et al. (2021). 
Our findings revealed that this architecture, applied to the bird classi-

straightforward approach. The proposed methodology can be adapted to 
other CNN architectures.

placed  on  keeping  the  models  simple  and  computationally  efficient, 
ensuring their reusability and applicability to other research cases. Our 
open-source  code  is  available  on  GitHub,  and  the  data  used  is  freely

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify bird species based on spectrogram inputs. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which includes two convolutional layers, max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. The output of the model is a probability for each of the 22 bird species under consideration. Additionally, the text mentions exploring different methods to enhance the neural network with contextual information, suggesting that the goal is to improve the accuracy of the classification model.
