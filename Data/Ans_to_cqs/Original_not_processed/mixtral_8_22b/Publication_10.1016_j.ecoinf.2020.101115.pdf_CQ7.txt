F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the
data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

Accessible

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a
standardized communications protocol
A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer
available

Interoperable

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly
applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

Reusable

R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate
and relevant attributes

teroperable and Reusable) open-data principles (Wilkinson et al.,
2016), were created through a bottom-up, community based initiative.
A component of the FAIR principals requires the usage of existing
standards (e.g. INSPIRE, O&M, Darwin Core). Consequently, scientists
have implemented FAIR data repositories specifically intended for
sample and data management (Adam et al., 2019; Conze et al., 2017;
Dassié et al., 2017; Lehnert et al., 2006; McNutt et al., 2016). However,
a FAIR compliant system and model for local repositories, purposefully
designed for physical ecological sample archives and their derived data,
has yet to materialize.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, generally, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common methods for splitting datasets include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time series split.

Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is on discussing the application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in managing and sharing ecological samples and their derived data. This includes creating metadata that clearly describes the data, registering or indexing the metadata in a searchable resource, using standardized communication protocols, and adhering to existing standards such as INSPIRE, O&M, and Darwin Core. While these practices contribute to making data more usable and interchangeable across different platforms and systems, they do not directly address the specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training.
