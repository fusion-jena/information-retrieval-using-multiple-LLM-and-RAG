2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

The manual effort in training data creation was reduced to template 
creation and validation of template-based detections in a graphical user 
interface (Fig. 3). This addresses an important need for more accessible 
training  data  from  study  sites  to  leverage  deep  learning  for  acoustic 
monitoring.  Our  evaluation  demonstrates  that  strong  classification 
performance  can  be  achieved  using  data  collected  from  the  study  re-
gion,  without  relying  on  crowd-sourced  public  datasets.  The  pipeline 
thus  increases  the  potential  for  region-optimized  acoustic  monitoring 
systems.  Furthermore,  the  training  data  collection  pipeline  could  ac-
celerate the collection of data for rare species. 

Our  training  scheme  allowed  for  multi-label  learning  from  single- 
label  training  data  by  defining  a  custom  training  loss  and  including

learning, wherein a model already optimized for a similar dataset is re- 
trained with new data. We used a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the 
ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across

be  necessary  to  increase  the  training  data  size  for  rare  species.  Thus, 
future  efforts  should  investigate  optimal  data  augmentation  methods 
for  bioacoustic  recognition.  Third,  an  important  challenge  will  be  to 
maintain  high  accuracy  while  increasing  the  efficiency  of  prediction. 
This  will  require  increasing  the  prediction  speed  and  decreasing  the 
memory  footprint  of  the  model by  investigating  other  network archi-
tectures and reducing the number of parameters.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not specify if the data is stored in any of the mentioned platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
