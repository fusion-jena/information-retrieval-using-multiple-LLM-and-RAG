and  Mean  IoU  (MIoU).  Notably,  in  addition  to  the  comprehensive 
evaluation  provided  by  the  Overall  Accuracy  and  IoU,  their  mean 
counterparts  (MA  and  MIoU)  consider  the  individual  values  for  each 
class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach en-
hances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. 
Furthermore, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the 
point at which the DNN attained optimal performance. 

Finally, the selected SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 
epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were 
computed after each epoch to analyse the training performance. Once 
trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification 
performance were selected to establish the reference trained model and, 
finally, it was used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds 
collected in Section 2.3, i.e. the ground truth data.

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

facing all modern AI-based algorithms is their efficiency in terms of time 
and  tensor  allocation  memory.  Therefore,  only  spatial  and  spectral

In the next section, the classifications of the real point clouds will be 
made using the MS-trained model, because it was proven that the model 
in this last experiment outperformed the previous ones, and their fuel 
type classifications will be more reliable.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Overall Accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Accuracy (MA), and Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU). These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Specifically, MA and MIoU take into account the individual values for each class within the dataset and compute their average, enhancing the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. The highest MIoU value is used to determine the point at which the Deep Neural Network (DNN) achieves optimal performance. Additionally, during the training process, metrics such as MIoU or MA are computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance.
