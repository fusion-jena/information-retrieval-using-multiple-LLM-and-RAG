quantile sketching algorithms. LGBM achieves a reduction in the num-
ber of sample features through gradient-based one-sided sampling and 
exclusive  feature  bundling  techniques  and  significantly  improves  the 
processing  speed  of  the  algorithm  (Meng,  2018).  CatBoost,  which  is 
based  on  symmetric  decision  trees,  can  handle  one-hot  encoding  for 
discrete features, addressing gradient bias and prediction shifts, leading 
to  improved  algorithm  accuracy  and  generalisation  capabilities  (Pro-
khorenkova  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  study,  an  integrated  development 
environment based on Python and Anaconda was used to complete the 
construction, training, testing, and hyperparameter optimisation of all 
models. RF and GBDT were provided in the Scikit-learn library, whereas 
XGBoost,  LGBM,  and  CatBoost  were  implemented  through  the 
Scikit-learn API interfaces.

Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

RF is the first algorithm selected as a representative of the bagging 
algorithm family, Random Forest (RF) is the first algorithm we selected 
(Breiman,  2001).  Taking regression  as  an example,  its  core idea  is  to 
construct multiple weak learners in parallel and ultimately output the 
result as the average of the weak learners to enhance model accuracy. In 
addition,  we  chose  several  Boosting  algorithms.  The  GBDT,  improves 
upon the initial boosting algorithm by introducing the concepts of fitting 
residuals and sampling (Friendman, 2001). XGBoost, built upon GBDT, 
it  incorporated  a  structural  risk  term  into  the  loss  function  L(y,y ˆ), 
forming the objective functionO(y,y ˆ), XGBoost also introduced a novel 
impurity measure metric, which considers complexity in splitting rules 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Additionally, it employs new tree-building 
processes, such as estimation greedy algorithms, parallel learning, and

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key-point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique serves a different purpose depending on the type of dataset being used and the problem being solved. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects within an image and their corresponding pixels. Polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects or regions of interest, while key-point annotation involves identifying specific points on an object or person. Landmark annotation is similar to key-point annotation but focuses more on facial recognition tasks. Again, without further context, it cannot be determined which specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the original text.
