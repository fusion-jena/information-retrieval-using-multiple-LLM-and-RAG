Deep learning only works well with lots of labeled data, sig-
niﬁcant computational resources, and modern neural network
architectures. Here, we combine the millions of labeled data
from the SS project, modern supercomputing, and state-of-
the-art deep neural network (DNN) architectures to test how
well deep learning can automate information extraction from
camera-trap images. We ﬁnd that the system is both able to
perform as well as teams of human volunteers on a large frac-
tion of the data and identiﬁes the few images that require
human evaluation. The net result is a system that dramatically
improves our ability to automatically extract valuable knowledge
from camera-trap images. Like every method, deep learning has
biases (discussed below) that must be kept in mind, corrected,
and/or accounted for when using this technology. Swanson et
al., 2016 (14) showed that the citizen-scientist approach also has
its own set of systematic biases, but that they can be adequately

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of millions of labeled data from the SS project, which suggests that one possible source of raw data could be publicly available datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR-10. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of deep learning to automate information extraction from camera-trap images, indicating that another potential source of raw data might be sensor data collected from cameras deployed in natural environments. Furthermore, the context references several papers related to deep learning and computer vision, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, suggesting that these models may have been employed in processing the raw data obtained from various sources.
