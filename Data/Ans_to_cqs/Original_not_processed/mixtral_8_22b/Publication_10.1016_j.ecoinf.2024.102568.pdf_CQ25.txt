The LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as 
loss function and the ADAM optimization (Kingma and Ba (2015)). To 
avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added. The dropout layer, described 
¨
by 
Ozgür  and  Nar  (2020),  is  a  regularization  method  that  randomly 
excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training 
a network. Inputs not set to zero are scaled up by 1/(1 (cid:0) rate) such that 
the  sum  over  all  inputs  remains  the  same.  The  training  set  is  pre-
processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling 
it  to  a  [0–1]  range.  The  dimension  of  the  temporal  window  must  be 
selected  dynamically  considering  the  performance  obtained  with 
different values on the available dataset. 

In  the  specific  case  of  Modena,  an  Italian  city  spanning  183  km2, 

there are two legal AQ stations denoted by red dots in Fig. 6.

Several  configurations  of  the  LSTM  architecture  were  tested  and 
compared  in  Casarotti  (2021)  showing  that  a  three  hidden  layer 
configuration of LSTM does not radically improve the performances, and 
with a small training dataset might be affected by overfitting. 

Since the co-location period needs to be as short as possible and deep 
learning models usually need many input data, the implemented solu-
tion  of  LSTM  is  a  trade-off  between  reaching  good  performances  and 
minimizing the dimension of the training data. 

For this reason, the LSTM model implemented has only one hidden 
layer  of  y  neurons,  where  y  is  determined  based  on  the  number  of 
training observations: 

y =

Ns
α*(Ni + No)

where Ns is the number of samples in the training set, Ni is the number of 
input neurons, No  is the number of output neurons, and α is usually a 
value between 5 and 10.

7.1. Performance 

Comparing the results of VR + SVR and LSTM, we can observe that, 
even if in some cases VR + SVR is performing better than LSTM, the 
increase in performance is usually less significant. Instead, in most cases 
where LSTM shows better results it significantly increases accuracy and 
reduces RMSE, MAE and MRE. Nevertheless, in cases where the size of 
the training dataset is restricted, the performance of LSTM models may 
prove to be inadequate. In these cases, the VR + SVR can provide better 
performance than the LSTM. From our experiments, we observed that a 
training period with <4000 observations generates a model unable to 
achieve satisfactory performance levels.

Moreover,  the  LSTM  model  was  not  able  to  predict  the  values  of 
concentration in the 13% of test observations due to the absence of a 
long enough sequence of previous observations without missing values 
in  the  input  features.  VR  + SVR  instead  is  always  able  to  provide  a 
prediction, satisfying the requirement of data completeness reported in 
Williams  et  al.  (2014).  Therefore,  VR  + SVR  is  a  good  alternative  to 
LSTM when there are frequent holes in the time series of measurements 
and when there are not enough past observations to successfully employ 
LSTM. 

With VR + SVR we demonstrated how to overcome the problem of

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is used for prediction or forecasting tasks related to air quality (AQ) monitoring. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere based on historical data collected from legal AQ stations located within the city of Modena, Italy. This information is crucial for understanding and managing air pollution levels in urban areas.

The LSTM model is chosen because it is well-suited for handling sequential data, which makes it ideal for analyzing time-series data like those generated by AQ monitoring systems. Additionally, the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function indicates that the goal of the model is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual concentrations of pollutants. Furthermore, the inclusion of a dropout layer helps prevent overfitting during the training process, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Overall, the primary objective of implementing this deep learning model appears to be improving the accuracy and reliability of air quality predictions, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental management strategies.
