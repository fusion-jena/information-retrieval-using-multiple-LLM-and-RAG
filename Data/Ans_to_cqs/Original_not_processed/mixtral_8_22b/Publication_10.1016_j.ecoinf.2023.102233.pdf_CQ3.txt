this to determine realistic performance outcomes for the CNN model and to identify areas where inter-annotator 
agreement may be improved. We also applied a classification approach that allowed the CNN model to classify 
sounds  into  an  ‘uncertain’  category,  which  replicated  a  requirement  of  human-annotation  and  facilitated  the 
comparison of human-model annotation performance.

An active learning strategy requires consideration of biases that may 
be  introduced  during  annotation  (Monarch,  2021).  While  annotation 
bias is a consideration for all ML datasets, the active learning framework 
allows ML models to be generated from smaller datasets and potentially 
developed  by  fewer  annotators  compared  to,  for  example,  a  publicly 
available  call  database  such  as  Xeno-canto  (Vellinga  and  Planqu´e, 
2015). In our study, the final model’s predictions most closely reflected 
the primary annotator’s labels, compared to the expert’s labels, which 
suggests that the model is replicating biases of the training data (Koe-
necke et al., 2020; Roh et al., 2019). Performance improvements may 
therefore  be  achieved  through  the  inclusion  of  labelled  training  data

Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses an active learning approach for iterative training and improvement of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This suggests that the researchers might have employed some form of supervised learning, possibly involving labeled training data.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and polygon annotation. These techniques help create labeled datasets required for training machine learning algorithms like CNNs.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to specify their location. Semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object or region class. Instance segmentation is similar but differentiates between individual instances of the same class. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes or boundaries within images.

While these techniques aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, they represent typical methods used in deep learning pipelines for various applications, including image classification, object detection, and semantic understanding.
