the classification accuracy. Due to memory issues, we could not feed the whole Vasiliko image for training. Instead, we had to divide the training image into four quadrants. The performance metrics were generated by sequentially training the model on each of the four quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset. In order to do this, we trained an initial model on the first quadrant and then updated the weights using the following quadrant. This step was repeated for the final three quadrants of the image. For training the model sequentially, we used a patch size of 7, the learning rate of 0.01, and used all the possible training samples in the quadrant. Table 8 summarizes the results for our sequential approach. We only generated results using the Kimisala-20 test image because Kimisala-10 is very large in size. The average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298, which was better than the earlier results in Table 7 in which only 30,000 samples were used to train Remote Sens. 2020,

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they were optimized through methods such as grid search or random search.
