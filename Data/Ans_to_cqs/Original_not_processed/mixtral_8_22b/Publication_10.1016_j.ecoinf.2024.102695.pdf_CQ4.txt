2.2. Transformer 

Since its introduction by Vaswani and others in 2017 Vaswani et al. 
(2017), the Transformer model has led to a significant revolution in the 
field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key innovations of 
the  Transformer  is  the  self-attention  mechanism,  which  allows  the 
model  to  weigh  the  importance  of  different  parts  of  the  input  data 
differently.  The  core  self-attention  mechanism  is  represented  by  For-
mula 5: 

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax

(

QKT
√
̅̅̅̅̅
dk

)

V

Here,  Q,  K,  and  V  represent  the  query,  key,  and  value  matrices, 
respectively.  The  query  matrix  represents  the  current  word  or  token 
being processed, while the key and value matrices represent the entire 
̅̅̅̅̅
input sequence. The term 
dk
is a scaling factor used to normalize the 
dot products, where dk  is the dimensionality of the keys.

4.3.1. Data description

The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture context 
from the entire input sequence, making it highly effective for tasks such 
as  sequence-to-sequence  modeling.  Additionally,  the  Transformer  uti-
lizes a positional encoding scheme to give the model a sense of word 
order, which is crucial for understanding the structure of a sentence. The 
positional encoding is added to the input embeddings and is defined as 
follows: 

PE(pos, 2i) = sin

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

PE(pos, 2i + 1) = cos

)

(

pos
100002i/dmodel

(6)  

(7) 

In these equations, pos is the position and i is the dimension. Each 
dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid, which 
helps  the  model  determine  the  position  or  order  of  the  tokens  in  the 
input sequence.

with  the  sparseness  and  imbalance  of  the  data,  these  characteristics 
impose greater requirements on Transformer prediction models.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, I can provide some general examples of common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping images, which helps the model learn more robust features. Rotation involves rotating images by various degrees, helping the model understand that objects remain the same despite their orientation. Scaling changes the size of images, allowing the model to recognize objects regardless of their scale. Cropping removes portions of images, encouraging the model to focus on important features. Padding adds extra pixels around images, maintaining consistent dimensions across inputs. Lastly, adding noise introduces random variations into images, improving the model's ability to handle real-world imperfections.
