To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

Helpful Answer:
There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a significant imbalance in the number of instances belonging to different classes. It involves duplicating some instances of the minority class until it has the same number of instances as the majority class. This helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is another technique used to handle class imbalance. It involves removing some instances of the majority class until it has the same number of instances as the minority class. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the classifier.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real world. This can help prevent the classifier from being biased towards certain types of data.

These techniques can be combined to achieve better results. For example, stratified sampling can be used along with oversampling or undersampling to create balanced datasets. Additionally, diverse data collection can be used to collect data from multiple sources before using stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling.
