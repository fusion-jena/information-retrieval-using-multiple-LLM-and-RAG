Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

VAE initially draw an instance z from the code distribution pmodel(z). The 
sample is executed via a differentiable generator network g(z). Lastly, x 
undergo sampling from a distribution Pmodel(x; g(z)) = pmodel(x| z). At the 
time of training process, the estimated inference network (or encoder) q 
(z| x)  can  be  employed  for  obtaining  z  and  Pmodel  (x| z)  is  afterward 
considered  as  the  decoder  network  (Dai  et  al.,  2019).  The  main 
perception of VAE is that it can be trained using the maximization of the 
variational lower bound L(q) related to the data point x:

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for satellite image classification and mentions some relevant research papers. To find out where the code repository is located, one would need additional information or access to the original source material.
