2.2. Deep learning in remote sensing

In the last decade, deep learning has revolutionized the way infor-
mation is extracted from images. In particular, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented results in areas like
image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman,
2015; He et al., 2016), semantic segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2016), object detection (Szegedy et al., 2013; Girshick et al.,
2014; Redmon et al., 2016) and further perception tasks.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it does mention some common datasets used in deep learning such as ImageNet, which was used by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) for image classification tasks. Additionally, Long et al. (2015) used the Pascal VOC dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It should be noted that these datasets were not explicitly stated as being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the given context. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined what datasets were specifically used in those pipelines.
