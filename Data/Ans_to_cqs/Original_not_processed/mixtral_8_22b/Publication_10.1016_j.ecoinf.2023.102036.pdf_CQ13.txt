Each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch 
size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar 
photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iter-
ations. TensorBoard —a set of visualization tools included in the open- 
source  library  for  machine  learning  TensorFlow—  was  used  to  study 
the performance of the runs. The selected parameters correspond to the 
run shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Helpful Answer:
The table titled 'Model training optimized parameters' provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. These include the learning rate, momentum, SD threshold, and input size. The search intervals for these parameters were [0,1], [0.05, 0.25], {(75, 125, 3), (100, 150, 3), (200, 250, 3)}, respectively. The optimized values for these parameters were found to be 0.096, 0.845, 0.05, and (200, 250, 3), respectively. Additionally, each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iterations. TensorBoard was used to study the performance of the runs.
