Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.

The ANN requires that the learning rate, number of nodes in a single
hidden layer, and maximum number of training epochs are speciﬁed
(Hill and Minsker, 2010). In this study, we used the optimal number
error approach. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied be-
tween 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in in-
crements of 0.05. For each conﬁguration, the mean square error (MSE)
between the model output and the measured data was calculated.
Fig 2 illustrates the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer

and the optimal learning rate having the maximum model performance
as indicated by MSE. The number of neurons in the hidden layer and the
optimal learning rate were selected using a trial-and-error method.
The ﬁnal ANN structure had ﬁve input variables with one node
accounting for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node accounting for
bias, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable of the output layer
(Figs. 2 and 3).
