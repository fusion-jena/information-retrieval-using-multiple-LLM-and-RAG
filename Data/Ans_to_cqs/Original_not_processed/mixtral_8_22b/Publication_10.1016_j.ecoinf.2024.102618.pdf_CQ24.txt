Ensemble deep learning models

models  from  the  state-of-the-art  deep  learning  models  were  initially 
experimented  with.  The  results  of  the  best  five  models  are  reported. 
Moreover,  different  ensemble  learning  models  (chosen  randomly)  are 
utilized to get better accuracy. We developed a model that distinguishes 
between healthy and diseased crop leaves and, in the event that the crop 
has a disease, can identify which illness it is. To the best of the authors’ 
knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an in-depth study on the 
use of different ensemble deep-learning models in solving the problem of 
plant  disease  classification.  In  this  study,  ten  different  ensembles  are 
tested to evaluate their performance. Offline data balancing was applied 
to the source dataset. The dataset used in this work is made up of 38 
distinct classes – shown in Table 2 – that have been created from around 
87 K RGB images of both healthy and damaged crop leaves.

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices in handling randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and averaging multiple runs to mitigate the impact of random initialization. These methods help ensure consistent results across experiments and reduce the variability caused by random factors.
