situation is for the samples to be surveyed in the field. However, because 
these data are sometimes difficult to gather, researchers may be tempted 
to employ fewer sample points. Time and access constraints in croplands 
and other remote environments may force researchers to obtain training 
and validation sample points from imagery rather than field validation, 
i.e., through image interpretation, as has been done here, which benefits 
sample selection from both fields survey and GE HR images. Although 
the certainty of a training sample’s class may be poor in some situations, 
this  method  allows  for  the  quick  and  efficient  gathering  of  a  higher 
number of training samples, allowing for a bigger sample collection size.

eral area of the city (consisting of man-made objects such as buildings,

As a part of the classification process, we use the supervised Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is proved to be one of the most 

successful algorithms to classify the layer-stacked multi-modal dataset 
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Faris et al., 2018; Joshi and Miller, 2021). 
There  are  several  classification  algorithms  used  in  machine  learning; 
however, SVM is better than most of them since it produces more ac-
curate results. SVM classifiers are more computationally complex than 
other classifiers, even when the number of positive and negative samples 
is not equal. SVM could also normalize the data or project it into the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the researcher employed a form of image interpretation for obtaining training and validation sample points. This technique involves analyzing and interpreting satellite imagery to identify and label various classes or categories present within the images. While this approach might not directly correspond to traditional data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it still serves as a means of generating labeled datasets required for training deep learning models. The mentioned McNemar's test analysis suggests that multiple feature sets were utilized during the model development process, including visible bands, multispectral bands, spectral indices, and textural features derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. These diverse feature sets likely contributed to improved performance across various classes, such as water-covered surfaces, urban areas, and vegetated landscapes.
