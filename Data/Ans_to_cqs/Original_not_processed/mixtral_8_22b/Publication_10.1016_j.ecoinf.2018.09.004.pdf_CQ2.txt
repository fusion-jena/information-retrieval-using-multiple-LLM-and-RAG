explicit or expanded database is being used.

For the temporal variables we derived 1 value for each month of the
year, the average for each season of the year, the average for the year,
and the maximum and minimum values that were reported for the year,
totaling 19 variables. In the cases were 2 layers were used, variables are
doubled to 38. Static variables have only one ﬁxed value. The total
number of variables that we collected are 217.

When pre-processing the data, substrate was the only categorical
variable, and in order for all machine learning algorithms to work, one-
hot encoding was used, where a new binary variable is added for each
unique categorical value. Also, we wanted to extract the values for the
bottom of the sea, where the seagrass meadows live, and check their
relative importance compared to the surface values. In this respect, a
Python script was developed reading each netCDF pixel and returning
the bottom value of the relevant Copernicus variables.

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. However, it does provide some information about the type of data used in the study. The researchers use temporal variables, which could potentially come from various sources like time series data, sensor readings, etc. They also mention using static variables, which might be stored in any format depending upon the source. Furthermore, they discuss using NetCDF pixels, indicating that they are working with geospatial data.

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a self-describing, machine-independent data format commonly used in meteorology, oceanography, and other scientific fields dealing with large datasets. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of multidimensional data, making it ideal for handling geospatial data.

Based on these details, while the exact file formats aren't specified, it appears that the researchers primarily deal with numerical data, possibly including geospatial data in NetCDF format.
