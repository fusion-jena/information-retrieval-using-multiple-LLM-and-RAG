Several  data  augmentation  methods  are  applied  to  the  data  for  a 
Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)-based  model  in  (Shijie  et  al., 
2017). The data augmentation technique enhances the diversity of the 
data  without  the need  to attach  or add  a  new  dataset to  the  training 
process. They utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flipping, 
cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, 
and  rotation  techniques.  The  experiments  conducted  in  this  research 
prove that the performance of four augmentation techniques (cropping, 
flipping,  GANs  and  rotation)  is  better  than  the  other  augmentation 
methods. It is obvious that using a combination of various augmentation 
methods  is  significantly  more  advantageous  than  using  individual 
methods alone.

Different  deep  learning  models  are  tested  to  find  the  model  with  the 
highest accuracy. The results show that EfficientNet achieves the highest 
accuracy.  A  data  augmentation  technique  is  added  to  increase  the 
number  of  images  from 55,448  to  61,486  images.  Results  of  the  pro-
posed deep learning models on the dataset with and without augmen-
tation  are  reported. This  work  augments  the  dataset using a  complex 
data augmentation technique to produce a new dataset. However, in our 
proposed work we use an augmented version of PlanVillage that can be 
used by different researchers for comparison. Also, we propose using a

Helpful Answer:
The paper by Shijie et al. (2017) applies several data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model. These techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flipping, cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, and rotation. Among these, cropping, flipping, GANs, and rotation were found to have superior performance compared to the others. Furthermore, combining multiple augmentation techniques was observed to yield significant advantages over employing individual methods alone.

In another study, Tiwari et al. (2021) developed a new dataset and tested new data augmentation algorithms. Although specific details about the employed augmentation techniques are not mentioned, they likely included common methods such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and translating images.

Additionally, Shrivastava and Pradhan (2021) utilized color features for rice plant disease classification using machine learning approaches. While not explicitly stated, it is plausible that their methodology involved some form of color manipulation as part of their data augmentation process.

Lastly, Tan and Le (2019) introduced EfficientNet, which achieved high accuracy among various deep learning models. Their approach incorporated a complex data augmentation technique to expand the number of images from 55,448 to 61,486. Unfortunately, the exact nature of this augmentation technique remains unspecified within the given context.

In summary, the discussed papers apply numerous data augmentation techniques, including but not limited to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flipping, cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, and rotation. Some studies also mention utilizing complex or novel augmentation methods; however, further information regarding these techniques is not available within the provided context.
