Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the dataset. It is important to choose appropriate data augmentation techniques based on the nature of the problem and the type of input data being used.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query as there is no relevant information regarding data augmentation techniques in the given context.
