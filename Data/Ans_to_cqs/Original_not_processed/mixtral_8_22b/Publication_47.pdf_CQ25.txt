Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

We implemented a deep neural network algorithm
(Goodfellow et al. 2016)—IUC-NN—as an R package
(IUCNN, available at https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN)
based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow (https://
www.tensorflow.org) library to predict the conservation
status of unevaluated orchid species. We based the pre-
dictions on 4 groups of features, derivable from digitally
available occurrence records: geographic (mean latitude
and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent
of occurrence [EOO], area of occupancy [AOO], number
of locations [sensu IUCN], and occurrence records); cli-
matic (mean of 19 bioclim variables [Karger et al. 2017]);
biome (presence in 14 biomes [Olson et al. 2001]); and

anthropogenic (mean Human Footprint Index [Wildlife
Conservation Society & International Earth Science In-
formation Network 2005]).

Including data on species trade, land use, or life his-
tory, once they are available, may help increase the ac-
curacy of IUC-NN and overcome dependency on threat
category (Supporting Information). Additionally, combin-
ing the binary and detailed model, the results of which
were contradictory in some cases (Supporting Informa-
tion), may increase the performance of IUC-NN. We sug-
gest that labeling species where the binary and detailed
model disagree as data deficient might reduce the num-
ber of false predictions. Future developments of IUC-NN
will quantify the estimation of threat as a continuous pa-
rameter to increase the accuracy for intermediate threat
levels and will implement Bayesian neural networks to
quantify uncertainties in the prediction (Silvestro & An-
dermann 2020).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model, referred to as IUC-NN, is to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species. This model was developed using a deep neural network algorithm and is based on four groups of features derived from digital occurrence records. These include geographical, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors. The goal of this model is to aid in assessing the conservation needs of various orchid species and identifying areas of high extinction risk.
