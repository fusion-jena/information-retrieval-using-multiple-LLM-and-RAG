2.3. Pre-processing of imagery

2.4. Segmentation and classiﬁcation

4.2. Opportunities of the modeling approach

Segmentation and classiﬁcation strategies in eCognition are still
rapidly evolving; methods and rule sets for automatically selecting
segmentation parameters are under development (Dragut et al.,
2010, 2014; Martha et al., 2012), but there is not yet consensus on
best practices. Better classiﬁcations, which could then better capture
the process of interest, may be possible as these tools develop fur-
ther. Machine learning techniques are being brought together with

segmentation to more automatically classify images (Nancy Thomas,
personal communication). This set of approaches with historical im-
agery could become more powerful as new methods are developed.
We do caution that even with machine learning, some supervision
and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or
other data sources are still necessary (Sexton et al., 2015).

(Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle; Wood, 2006). The GAM was ideal
for these data for two reasons: 1) a Markovian random ﬁeld (MRF)
basis was available for the smoothing function, which is designed for
use with polygons with potentially irregular sizes (which some of the
cells have after applying the forest-only analysis mask); and 2) mgcv
had extensions for non-normal response variables. The quasi-binomial
family was an appropriate choice, as it allowed for overdispersion. The
response variable was then framed as a number of 1-m by 1-m cells
within the 20-m by 20-m cell of the DEM which were classiﬁed as
‘woody cover’ as binomial successes, and those classiﬁed as ‘herbaceous
cover’ as binomial failures.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, based on general knowledge, common postprocessing steps after model training include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. A confusion matrix can also be used to visualize the performance of the model. Additionally, saliency maps can be generated to understand how the model arrived at its predictions. These steps help in fine tuning the model and improving its performance.
