varies from 7 s to 16 s, depending on the image size and the number of 
objects in the image and their sizes, which is a very fast processing time 
for  high-pixels-per-image  (HPP)  images  up  to  50  MB  based  on  the 
camera system that is explained in Section 3. The overall computational 
complexity of the developed algorithms is O(n log n). It is important to 
point out that the supervised DL and ML approaches, designed by us in 
our previous work in (Kuru et al., 2023), that runs on similar images in 
the same surveys, can detect specific marine small natural objects (e.g., 
birds) in a few seconds (i.e., between 2 and 4 s). In this sense, we can 
conclude that DL and ML techniques slightly outperform the proposed 
non-supervised technique developed in this study considering the pro-
cessing time.

overfitting, and finally iii) let field experts evaluate the model with a 
completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. 
The model can be deployed if it passes these three phases successfully. 
These phases are outlined in Fig. 3. The obtained results as well as their 
evaluation  are  provided  in  the  following  section.  The  experimental 
design of data utilisation and data processing phases with their targeted 
objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM‘s database. The 
viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to a standard scale, while scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, and augmentation generates additional training samples through various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and convergence speed of the deep learning model.
