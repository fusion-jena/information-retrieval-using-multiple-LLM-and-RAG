Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

applied a sigmoid activation to the output layer of the CNN to generate 
predictions between 0 and 1.

3.1. CNN model development with active learning 

The CNN model performance stabilised within five active learning 
iterations (Fig. 4). The majority of model performance improvement was 
achieved within the first two iterations, with a 34.3% decrease in macro- 
averaged MAE between iterations one and three, compared to a 12.1% 
decrease in macro-averaged MAE between iterations three and the final 
model (Fig. 4). Most of the training data added between iterations one 
and  three  consisted  of  non-target  calls  (Table  1),  which  led  to  rapid 
improvements in the model’s ability to differentiate non-target sounds, 
resulting in a reduction in false positives.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a grid search technique to optimize the hyperparameters of their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This method involves systematically testing various combinations of hyperparameters to find the best configuration for the model. However, the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot definitively state which optimization techniques were employed in this study.
