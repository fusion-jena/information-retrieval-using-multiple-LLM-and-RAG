Transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on one dataset is re- 
trained  to  classify  a  similar  datset,  is  one  convenient  approach  to 
effectively  utilize  the  power  of  CNNs.  Well-known  pre-trained  archi-
tectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have recently been 
used with great success for the classification of birds in soundscape re-
cordings (Florentin et al., 2020; He et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2017; 
Incze et al., 2018; LeBien et al., 2020; Sevilla and Glotin, 2017; Szegedy 
et  al.,  2014).  Such  networks  are  typically  pre-trained  on  large  image 
databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples 
distributed across 1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). However, in cases 
where  targeting  foreground  species  is  the  main  task,  or  with  more 
acoustically sparse soundscapes, CNN architectures with far fewer (<10) 
convolutional layers have proven more than sufficient, and indeed, may

2.5. Convolutional neural network architecture 

To classify the spectrograms, a two-dimensional convolutional neu-
ral network (CNN) was constructed using the Python package Keras with 
a Tensorflow backend (Abadi et al., 2015; Chollet, 2015). Each of the 
four convolutional layers had a 3 Ã— 3 kernel. The first two layers had 64 
filters, while the latter two had 128 filters. Following each convolution 
block, a batch normalization layer and max pooling layer were applied. 
After the first convolution step, both the kernel and stride of the max 
pooling layer were 2, while for the final three, a kernel and stride size of 
4 were used (see Fig. 5 for more details). 

These network parameters were selected using the Python optimi-
zation library Hyperopt. Hyperopt compares the results of training the 
network  on  different  combinations  of  parameters  using  an  oriented 
random search (Bergstra et al., 2013).

can  be  highly  variable,  they  cannot  be  readily  compressed  into  the 
feature sets suitable for these traditional machine learning paradigms 
(Kong  et  al.,  2017).  Consequently,  it  is  advantageous  to  carry  out 
analysis  on  spectrograms,  pictorial  representations  of  the  raw  audio 
data.  Spectrograms  convey  the  temporal  dimension  on  the  horizontal 
axis,  while  frequency  increases  along  the  vertical  axis.  The  third 
dimension of a spectrogram, sound power level, is typically represented 
with  color.  To  classify  audio  data  in  this  form,  networks  specifically 
designed  for  image  classification,  convolutional  neural  networks 
(CNNs), are often employed (Florentin et al., 2020; Kahl et al., 2019; 
Ruff et al., 2020). CNNs, like other deep learning models, involve end-to- 
end  learning,  where  feature  sets  are  not  hand-selected,  but  instead 
learned during training.

Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that well-known pre-trained architectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have been used successfully for bird classification in soundscape recordings. These networks are typically pre-trained on large image databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples distributed across 1000 classes. However, it also notes that in some cases, CNN architectures with far fewer convolutional layers have proven sufficient, and that pre-training on both ResNet50 and Inception neural networks did not meaningfully improve classification performance in this study. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the ImageNet dataset was likely used for pre-training the models, but the specific dataset used for the actual bird classification task is not explicitly mentioned.
