time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

Classification of kNDVI trend types.

Slope < 0&P > 0.05 
Slope > 0&P > 0.05 
Slope > 0&P < 0.05 

Types

The Q value, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver in 
the OPGD, is also influenced by the size of the OPGD data sampling grid. 
It is common to compare the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers 
at different spatial scales and select the optimal sampling grid based on 
the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest(Song et al., 2020; Yu 
et al., 2023). In this paper, Q values for each driver were compared at 
grid scales of 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km, 3 km*3 km, 4 km*4 km, 5 km*5 
km and 6 km*6 km.  

(ii)  Factor detector 

The factor detector assesses the independent explanatory power of 
each driver in relation to the spatial variance in the kNDVI using the Q

where Q represents the explanatory power of each driver factor on the 
spatial variability of the kNDVI, with values ranging between [0,1]. A 
higher Q value indicates a stronger ability of the influencing factor to 
explain the kNDVI, and vice versa(Wang and Xu, 2017). L denotes the 
number  of  strata  for  each  driver  factor,  and  Nh  and  N  represent  the 
sample size of each driver factor within stratum h and the entire region, 
respectively. σ2and σ2
h  represent the total variance in the whole region 
and the variance in the kNDVI in the h-th stratum, respectively. SSW and 
SST represent the square sum of the kNDVI within stratum h and the 
square sum across the entire region, respectively.  

(iii)  Interaction detector

2021b; Yang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023). However, certain VIs, such as 
the NDVI, can become saturated, reducing sensitivity in areas with dense 
vegetation, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions (Qiu et al., 
2018;  Yan  et  al.,  2022). Fortunately, Camps-Valls  et  al.  (2021)  intro-
duced the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) using 
machine learning and kernel function theory. In all application evalu-
ations of different biomes and climate zones,this novel nonlinear vege-
tation index is more robust to saturation and mixed pixel problems than 
NDVI  (Camps-Valls  et  al.,  2021),  making  it  a  promising  proxy  for 
studying the spatial patterns of vegetation growth in dense forest areas.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The given context only discusses the use of machine learning and kernel function theory in introducing the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) but does not provide any details about the specific deep learning model employed.
