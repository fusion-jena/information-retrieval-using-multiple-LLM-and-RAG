%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not provide details about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
