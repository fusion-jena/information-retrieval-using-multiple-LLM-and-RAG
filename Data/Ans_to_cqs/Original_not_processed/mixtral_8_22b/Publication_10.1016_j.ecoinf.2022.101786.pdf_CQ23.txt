Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

2.4. Model evaluation 

The testing dataset was composed of 500 manually annotated images 
from  the  same  transect  and  was  only  used  to  calculate  performances 
outside  the  Darknet  framework  by  comparing  CNN  predictions  with 
manual annotations. 

Predictions  come  as  a  .JSON  file  containing  the  coordinate  of  the 
bounding box of each tentative annotation as well as a confidence score 
ranging from 0.05 at minimum (lower confidence scores introduced too 
much  noise  and  therefore  were  not  recorded)  to  1  at  maximum.  Pre-
dictions made on the testing set were compared to the manual annota-
tion of the same images.

2.5. Model selection 

CNNs are sensitive to overfitting (Domingos, 2012). Throughout the 
training process, the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the 
training set - evaluating performance on the validation set – adjusting 
CNN node weights – before repeating the entire cycle. These cycles are 
referred to as epochs or iterations when the training dataset is too large 
to  be  processed  in  one  stroke  and  needs  to  be  subdivided  in  several 
smaller batches as is the case in this study. There is an optimum number 
of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets 
(independent data that the CNN has not seen) start to diverge as the CNN 
overfits  and  becomes  more  specialized  at  predicting  the  training  set 
while becoming less able to predict the validation set (generalization).

3.1. Model evaluation and selection 

The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong 
influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its 
predictions (Fig. 2). In general, longer model training past 1000 itera-
tions tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the resolution of the input images was maintained at 704 × 704 pixels, allowing the model to learn from detailed features without being overwhelmed by high-resolution information. Secondly, the batch size was set to 64, striking a balance between computational efficiency and maintaining enough diversity within each batch to prevent overfitting. Thirdly, the model was trained using 32 subdivisions, further increasing the variety of inputs presented during training. Lastly, the model was trained for up to 6000 iterations, providing ample opportunity for the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data while avoiding overfitting. Additionally, the authors employed manual annotations to create diverse training, validation, and testing datasets, ensuring that the model could perform well across various scenarios. To monitor the risk of overfitting, the authors evaluated the model's performance on both the training and validation sets throughout the training process, selecting the optimal iteration where the performance on these independent datasets converged. This approach allowed them to strike a balance between specializing the model for their specific task and maintaining its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
