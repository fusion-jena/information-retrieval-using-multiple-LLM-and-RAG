over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

We interpolated weather station data through four statistical algo-
rithms: a generalized additive model (GAM), an artificial single-hidden- 
layer neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), and a generalized 
boosting  regression  model  (GBM).  We  employed  physiographic  de-
scriptors known to drive local climatic conditions as predictors in the 
algorithms; these descriptors were altitude, northness, eastness, distance 
to the coast, and monthly average of daily clear-sky insolation time. We 
derived most of these descriptors (altitude, northness, eastness, distance 
to the coast) from a digital terrain model at 10 m resolution in R, version 
4.1.3 (R Core Team, 2022). Monthly averages of daily clear-sky insola-
tion times were calculated by averaging the daily daylight lengths pro-
vided  by  the  R.SUN  routine  available in  GRASS  GIS,  version 7.8.5.  We 
fitted GAMs by defining a cubic regression spline for each descriptor and

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific values for the random seed. However, it mentions that Random Forests were used with 500 trees, which suggests some form of control over the randomness inherent in this type of ensemble learning method. Additionally, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) were also used, but no details regarding controlling randomness within this framework are mentioned. In general, one common strategy to manage randomness is to set a fixed seed value before running any code involving random processes, ensuring reproducibility. Another approach could be cross-validation, where multiple runs with different seeds are performed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the results. Nevertheless, based solely on the given text, I cannot provide more detailed insights into the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
