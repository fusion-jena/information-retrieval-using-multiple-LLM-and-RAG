burn-in  steps,  171  thinning  steps  and  4  chains  were  extracted.  The 
resulting MCMC diagnostics are very similar to the informative model 
and  show  no  issues  with  representativeness  and  accuracy.  Diagnostic 
plots are given in Appendix. The model efficiency was 23.1 min on the 
same machine used in previous models, which is still efficient in terms of 
implementation time, considering the complexity of the model.

To consider the model uncertainty, the models given in Fig. 15 are 
considered  as  the  set  of  models,  Ψ  of  Section  2.2.2.  Then  the  BMA 
approach is implemented. Each model’s prior probability is set to 0.2 to 
give equal chances a priori. The resulting posterior model probabilities, 
P(m| D), and Bayes factors to compare the models are given in Fig. 15. 
Bayes factors can also be interpreted as the improvement in the proba-
bility of occurrence for a given model. This analysis provides insights 
into  which  model  is  most  impactful  in  predicting wildfire  occurrence 
probabilities  and  provides  evidence  on  if  forest  vulnerability  is  the 
dominant  predictor.  The  results  indicate  forest  vulnerability  as  the 
dominant predictor, as this model is 2.5 times more likely to occur based 
on the posterior odds. The model that includes forest vulnerability with 
mean  wind  speed  is  the  second  most  likely, with  2.3  times  improved

The model defined in Section 2.2.1 induces independent normally 
distributed  prior  distributions  on  the  model  parameters.  These  priors 
can either be informative or noninformative. The exponential of each βj 
parameter,  exp(βj),  represents  the  increase  in  the  odds  of  having  a 
wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor Xj. Thus, the exponential 
of the mean of a normal prior, exp(Mj), is set to the prior information 
about the odds of having a wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor 
Xj.  The  weight  of  the  prior  information  (degree  of  belief  in  the  prior 
information) is expressed by using the variance of a normal prior, Sj. The 
lower the prior variance, the higher the weight of prior information in 
the resulting parameter estimates. In that sense, we get a noninformative 
prior for high values of Sj and vice versa. However, this approach does 
not  incorporate  the  mediating  effects  that  can  exist  between  the  pre-

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics help understand how well the model has learned from the data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the classifier. It shows the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. This helps identify where the model is performing well and where it needs improvement.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input images that contribute significantly to the output prediction. They provide insight into what features the model is focusing on while making decisions.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, etc., to improve the model's performance further.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models through ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can lead to better overall performance compared to individual models.

6. Model Interpretability: Explaining the decision-making process of complex models is crucial for understanding their behavior and building trust. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, feature importance plots, partial dependence plots, etc., can be employed for interpreting black-box models.

In summary, postprocessing involves evaluating the trained model, optimizing its performance, combining multiple models, and explaining its decision-making process.
