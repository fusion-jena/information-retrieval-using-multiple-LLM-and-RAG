2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model uses several hyperparameters during the training process. These include a batch size of 32, which was chosen to avoid exceeding the memory limit while also making full use of available computer resources. The optimizer used is Adam processing, and the learning rate varies with groups according to the cosine function's law, typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The model undergoes 100 epochs of training using an early stopping function to cease the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. Additionally, the loss function employed is the cross-entropy loss function.
