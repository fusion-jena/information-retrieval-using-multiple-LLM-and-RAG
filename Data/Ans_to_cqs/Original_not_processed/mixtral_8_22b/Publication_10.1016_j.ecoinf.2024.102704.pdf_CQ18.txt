2.4. Model training 

The  experiments  were  conducted  on  a  Windows  10-based  mobile 
laptop  equipped  with  an  Intel(R)  i7-11800H  CPU  and  a  GeForce 
RTX3080  GPU  with  16GB  of  video  memory.  The  PyCharm  software 
platform was utilised to carry out the experiments, employing Python 
3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. 
The  details  of  the  specific  environmental  configurations  and  model 
training parameters are listed in Table 1. To enhance detection accuracy, 
this study established detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, 
indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 
30% or higher was considered valid and thus retained.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study used a Windows 10 laptop with an Intel i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory to conduct their experiments. They utilized the PyCharm platform with Python 3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy employed during the training process.
