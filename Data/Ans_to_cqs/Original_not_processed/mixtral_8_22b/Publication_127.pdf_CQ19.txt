A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

Architectures. Different DNNs have different architectures,
meaning the type of layers they contain (e.g., convolutional lay-
ers, fully connected layers, pooling layers, etc.) and the number,
order, and size of those layers (13). In this work, we tested
nine different modern architectures at or near the state of the
art (Table 1) to ﬁnd the highest-performing networks and to
compare our results to those from Gomez et al. (45). We only
trained each model one time because doing so is computationally
expensive and because both theoretical and empirical evidence
suggests that different DNNs trained with the same architecture,
but initialized differently, often converge to similar performance
levels (13, 17, 51).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned. These could include popular options like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, or others. To find out exactly which frameworks were used, additional details would need to be provided.
