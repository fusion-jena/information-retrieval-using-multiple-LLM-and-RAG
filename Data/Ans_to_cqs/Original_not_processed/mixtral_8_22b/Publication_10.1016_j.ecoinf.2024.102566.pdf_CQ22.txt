N2 refers to the referencing biomass density. 

Furthermore,  we  obtained  two  existing  datasets  on  forest  biomass 
carbon in China from Chen et al. (2023) and Liu et al., 2015b. These 
datasets  were  converted  into  biomass  density  using  a  carbon  content 
ratio of 0.49 (Zhao et al., 2019), allowing for cross-comparison with our 
results.

%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, etc. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall or sensitivity is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, and Area Under Curve (AUC) represents degree or measure of separability.
