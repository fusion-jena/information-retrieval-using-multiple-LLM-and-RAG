Power plants can emit significant amounts of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere ( 
Pandey, 2020). Furthermore, the 
combustion of furnace oil or diesel in power 
plants produces substantial amounts of 
sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) (Kouravand and Kermani, 2018). 
Landfills can contribute to air pollution by 
releasing dust and gases such as methane 
(CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and etc. ( 
Iravanian and Ravari, 2020).

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. The context only provides references to academic papers related to air quality, pollution sources, and their impact on health. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
