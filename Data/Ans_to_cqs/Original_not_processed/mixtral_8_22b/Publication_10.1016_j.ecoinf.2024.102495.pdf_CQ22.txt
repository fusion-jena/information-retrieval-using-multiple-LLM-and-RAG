hop length: 256, length of the FFT window: 1024, and CNN model no. 1, 
which  used  the  following  parameters:  without  dropout,  RMSprop 
Optimizer, and a learning rate of 0.001. The accuracy score was 91.76% 
and  the  precision,  recall,  and  F1-Scores  were  86.59%,  98.82%,  and 
0.9230, respectively. 

The  multiclass  mosquito  classification  system  categorizes  three 
mosquito  types:  female  Aedes  aegypti,  male  Aedes  aegypti,  and  Culex 
quinquefasciatus.  Optimal  results  were  obtained  from  the  extraction 
feature configuration no. 9 with number of bands: 60, number of frames: 
60, hop length: 512, length of the FFT window: 1024, and CNN model

The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

The CNN model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 
32,  respectively.  This  model  was  compiled  using  a  categorical  cross- 
entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters used in the CNN algo-
rithm  were  tuned  using  a  root  mean  square  propagation  (RMSProp) 
optimizer. The model generated in the training process was evaluated 
using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accu-
racy,  precision,  recall,  F1-Score,  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  score, 
confusion  matrix,  and  model  training  time  for  binary  and  multiclass 
classifications (Forman and Scholz, 2010; Grandini et al., 2020; Ouyang 
et al., 2015). The model performance needs to be evaluated to determine 
the modelâ€™s ability to classify mosquitoes, and a good model is charac-
terized by high values of predetermined performance parameters.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) Score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision indicates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall calculates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. F1-Score combines both precision and recall into one metric, providing a more balanced measure of the model's performance. Lastly, the AUC Score represents the degree or measure of separability between classes, indicating how well the model can distinguish between different classes. These metrics help assess the effectiveness and reliability of the deep learning model in accurately classifying mosquito species.
