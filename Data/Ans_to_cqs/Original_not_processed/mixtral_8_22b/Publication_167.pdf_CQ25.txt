mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units.

DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal dependencies, fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the SM, and perform further LU simulations.  Figure 4. Deep learning module. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is also known as an ANN. In addition to the input/output layer, it can have multiple hidden layers in between. The simplest MLP contains only one hidden layer, i.e., a total of three layers, and its structure is shown in Figure 5. The MLP has full connections between the layers. The bottom layer of the MLP is the input layer, the middle layer is the hidden layer, and the top layer is the output layer. Assuming that the input layer is denoted by the vector X, then the output of the hidden layer is f (W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight and b1 is the offset. The commonly used functions (f) include the sigmoid function, tanh function, ReLU function, among others. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 3314

Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 22  2.3.3. Deep Learning Model Models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), i.e., deep learning-based models, are gaining attention in the remote sensing domain [30–34]. The neural networks are used to fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC. The drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC greatly influence the LUCC trajectories, play a dominant role in the study of the LUCC mechanism, and are the forces that cause changes in the LU patterns. Currently, the drivers of LUCC often include natural, socioeconomic, and political factors. The current consensus is that natural conditions control the basic trends and processes of the overall LUCC and the changes in the natural environment, such as climate change, and change the spatial distribution pattern of LU to a great extent. Human activities and socioeconomic factors are the main drivers of LUCC on a small spatiotemporal scale. LUCC is mainly driven by socioeconomic factors over short

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, we can infer from the given information that the deep learning model is being used to understand and predict land use and cover change (LUCC) patterns. This involves modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies and fitting the drivers and mechanisms of LUCC. The model uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN), to process input data and generate outputs. The inputs likely include various geographical and environmental features, while the outputs could be probabilities of certain LUCC scenarios occurring. Therefore, although not directly classified as such, the deep learning model here serves a similar purpose to a classification model, as it aims to categorize areas into different LUCC classes based on their characteristics and historical trends.
