5. Discussion 

In this study we developed a workflow which leveraged citizen sci-
ence data to extract further relevant records from social media posts in 
the  same  region.  The  workflow  functions  as  a  data  filter  enabling 
downsampling of an initially very large dataset into a human analysable 
subset - in our case containing 0.5% of the original posts. By massively 
reducing  data  volumes,  it  becomes  realistic  to  analyse  the  remaining 
data by hand to select true positives, with around one hour required for 
the  4000  or  so  candidate  posts  we  identified.  Our  workflow  thus  ad-
dresses  the  research  gap  identified  by  Burke  et  al.,  2022,  using  gen-
eralisable  methods  to  extract  target  data  from  various,  unverified 
sources to enrich data.

Flickr  is  a  social  media  site,  where  individuals  can  upload  photo-
graphs  and  metadata  including  tags  and  locations  in  the  form  of  co-
ordinates. Flickr usage has declined in recent years, but it remains very 
popular in research, mostly because of its well documented and easy to 
use API, which allows querying using search terms and bounding boxes. 
Our  citizen  scientist  data  came  from  two  platforms:  iNaturalist  and 
eBird.  iNaturalist  allows  participants  to  upload  images  of  organisms 
such  as  plants  and  insects  to  the  platform  and  use  its  community  to 
crowdsource the taxonomic identification. Currently according to their 
website  (https://inaturalist.org),  iNaturalist  hosts  nearly  100  Million 
observations of over 375,000 species and is therefore one of the largest 
and most successful citizen science projects to date (Unger et al., 2020). 
eBird has similar features to iNaturalist but as a platform is exclusively
