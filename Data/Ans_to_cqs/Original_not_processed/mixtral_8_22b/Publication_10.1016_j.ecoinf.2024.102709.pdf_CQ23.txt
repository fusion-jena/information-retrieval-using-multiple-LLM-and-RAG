To determine the ideal training–test split for our model, we used k- 
fold  cross-validation  (k  = 5,  epochs  = 500,  imagesize  = 640).  The 
epochs provide the number of repetitions for training, and the image size 
is  expressed in  pixels. k-fold  cross-validation  (Rodriguez et  al., 2010) 
was used to determine the best training test set for the model. Hereby, 
the data are split into k different training–test sets. The model was not 
trained on the entire dataset but on each training split. The result was an 
investigation of the best data split. Functions of the Python library scikit- 
learn  (scikit-learn  developers,  2023)  were  used  to  split  the  data  and 
investigate the results of each trained model. In addition, YOLO training 
losses and mAP50 values of each model were investigated. The split with 
the  highest  mAP50  value  indicates  the  highest  number  of  correctly 
predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. We used the

split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

Three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using our own data 
(clusters of extracted numbers), as described above, as input for training, 
whereas the other three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained with 
the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) 
dataset of handwritten digits, which can be used to train classification 
models (Deng, 2012).

Table  7  depicts  the  six  models  in  greater  detail  by  comparing 
different loss training values, which indicate how well the model learned 
during training. The goal of training was to minimize the loss value. The 
YOLO loss function was divided into three parts (Zafar et al., 2018). 

The box loss is a regression loss that measures the error in the pre-
dicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions relative to the ground 
truth. When the value is lower, the bounding boxes are more accurate (Li 
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). This value is computed by YOLO using 
Intersection  over  Union  (IoU)  (Zheng  et  al.,  2016)  and  distributional 
focal  loss  (DFL)  (X.  Li  et  al.,  2020b).  The  IoU  measures  the  distance 
between the ground truth and the actual box (Zheng et al., 2016). DFL

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, they utilized diverse datasets for training. Specifically, Models 4, 5, and 6 were trained using their own data, while Models 1, 2, and 3 were trained with the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This approach allowed them to evaluate the performance of their model across different types of data. Secondly, they employed k-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal training-test split for their model. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into 'k' subsets or folds, where one fold is used as the validation set and the remaining 'k-1' folds are used for training. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every subset serves as the validation set once. By doing so, they could assess the robustness of their model against variations in the training and testing data. Lastly, functions from the Python library scikit-learn were used to split the data and analyze the outcomes of each trained model. These functions likely included methods for stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets remains consistent with the original dataset. Overall, these strategies helped enhance the reliability and applicability of their deep learning model.
