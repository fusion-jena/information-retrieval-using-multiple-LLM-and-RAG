according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

• batch 1: visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 2: twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 3: MS + spectral indices  
• batch 4: MS + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands  
• batch  5:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1

sample’s class proportions are typical of the landscape’s real class pro-
portions. The analyst must make methodological decisions that present 
tradeoffs  in  data  quality  (i.e.,  class  representativeness)  and  quantity 
while  creating  training  data  for  RS  image  classification.  The  ideal

space  of  the  decision  boundary  that  separates  the  two  classes  (Yang 
et al., 2018). SVM also has the advantage of being able to work in n- 
dimensional  space,  which  makes  it  superior  to  other  algorithms. 
Furthermore, SVM does not influence the findings that were expected 
before  or  after  making  minor  changes  to  the  feature  extracted  data 
(Almansour  et  al.,  2019;  Gola  et  al.,  2019).  SVM  parameters  are  set 
based on the default values of GEE’s guideline (Radial Basis Function 
(RBF) was chosen as the kernel type, and the Gamma (γ) and cost pa-
rameters were set to 0.5 and 10, respectively). SVM is trained by training 
samples, and then the hybrid feature space (including the Sentinel-2 MS 
bands, Sentinel-2-derived VIs, water indices, bare soil indices, built-up 
indices, Sentinel-1  VV and VH bands, eight textural features, and the 
DSM) is fed to the classifier.

Helpful Answer:
According to the given context, the data was split into training and validation sets using a 60%-40% ratio. This means that 60% of the total samples were allocated for training the deep learning models, while the remaining 40% were reserved for validating their performance. No specific information is available regarding any separate testing dataset. However, typically, such datasets are created from the initial pool of samples before splitting them into training and validation sets. In this case, the distribution of samples can be seen in Figure 8, where there were no mis-collected samples found among the automatically gathered ones.

The data consisted of six batches with different combinations of input features derived from various sources like Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. These included visible (RGB) bands, multispectral (MS) bands, spectral indices, spectral features, textural features, and Digital Surface Model (DSM). Each batch had its unique combination of these features, allowing the exploration of diverse inputs for the deep learning models.

As for the machine learning algorithm employed here, Support Vector Machines (SVM) was utilized due to its advantages in handling high dimensional spaces and robustness against minor changes in the feature extraction process. The SVM parameters were set based on Google Earth Engine's guidelines, specifically choosing Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the kernel type and setting the gamma (γ) and cost parameters to 0.5 and 10, respectively.

In summary, the data was divided into training and validation sets according to a 60%-40% ratio without specifying a separate testing dataset. Six distinct batches containing varying combinations of input features were prepared for analysis. Lastly, the SVM algorithm was selected for modeling purposes, with its parameters configured based on Google Earth Engine's recommendations.
