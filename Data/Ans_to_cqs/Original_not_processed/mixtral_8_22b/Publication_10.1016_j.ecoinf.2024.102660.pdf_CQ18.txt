2.6. Evaluation metric 

This  study  employed  five  metrics,  namely  Accuracy  (A),  Precision 
(P),  Recall  (R),  F1-score  (F1),  and  Intersection  over  Union  (IOU),  to 
assess the effectiveness of the proposed model (Giles et al., 2021). Their 
calculation formulas are shown below:

2.5. Parameter setting 

The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. 
The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) 
Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory, along with 
an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the 
network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, 
flips,  and  other  image  augmentation  operations  to  enhance  the  net-
work’s robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size 
set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate 
was  adjusted  using  the  equal-interval  adjustment  strategy  (StepLR), 
halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the 
model  accuracy  during  the  training  phase,  and  356  image  pairs  for 
testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the study utilized 176 image pairs from the total 1764 image pairs for validation purposes. These image pairs were used to validate the model accuracy during the training phase. Additionally, the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. This approach helped ensure that the model did not overfit or underfit the training data, thereby maintaining optimal performance.
