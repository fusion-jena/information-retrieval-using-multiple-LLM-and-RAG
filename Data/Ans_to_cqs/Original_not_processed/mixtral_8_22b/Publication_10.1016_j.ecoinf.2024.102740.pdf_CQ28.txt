1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world‚Äôs terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world‚Äôs  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‚ÄòMara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform or any other platform was used for this purpose.
