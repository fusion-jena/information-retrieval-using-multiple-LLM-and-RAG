Recently, some approaches have been proposed to evaluate the interpretability of deep learning  models33,34 
including methods based on model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualisation. The relevance of 
network inputs can for example be obtained by the gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), which computes 
the prediction function squared partial derivatives with a standard gradient  backpropagation35. The Layer-wise 
Relevance Propagation (LRP)36 propagates the prediction backward in the neural network using propagation 
rules until the input features are reached. Arras et al.37 proposed a LRP for LSTM networks that provided better 
results than the GBSA on a five-class prediction task. Class activation maps were used to point out the most 
discriminative regions used by a CNN to identify a  class38.

These analyses help to understand the behaviour of deep learning models in agricultural applications. In par-
ticular, in the CAP activities in which payments to farmers must be well-founded, the use of classification models 
providing explainable predictions are of great interest. The conducted work not only confirm well established 
knowledge in remote sensing science but also opens the door to new studies in the field of the comprehensibility 
of deep learning algorithms in agricultural and environmental applications.

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). It also references papers that discuss these models in detail. For instance, reference [38] discusses the use of CNNs for identifying classes, while reference [37] proposes a LRP for LSTM networks. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
