2.7. Accuracy Assessment

The performance of the evaluated methods was expressed in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA),

F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA).

Overall Accuracy (OA): is a global metric that indicates the percentage of samples correctly
classiﬁed in relation to the total samples. It is deﬁned by:

OA =

tp + tn
P + N

× 100

The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

The buffer of both references was obtained applying the morphological dilation, using as
structuring elements a disk of radius 2. This operation expanded the boundaries of the deforested
polygons. Then, a difference between the dilated and original images was performed, resulting in the
outer edge, and the patches with the central pixel in these regions were not considered for training,
validation or test.

areas indicated by the classiﬁer. The ﬁrst metric is the Alarm Area deﬁned in Equation (6), whereas the
second metric is the Recall deﬁned in Equation (4).

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter optimization.
