Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions strategic planning based on a deep learning algorithm, which implies that some form of optimization technique is likely being employed within this process. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the implementation of the deep learning algorithm, we cannot determine which specific optimization techniques are utilized.
