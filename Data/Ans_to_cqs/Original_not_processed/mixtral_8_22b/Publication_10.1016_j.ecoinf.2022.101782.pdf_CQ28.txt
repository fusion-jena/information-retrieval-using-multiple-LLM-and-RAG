5. Discussion 

In this study we developed a workflow which leveraged citizen sci-
ence data to extract further relevant records from social media posts in 
the  same  region.  The  workflow  functions  as  a  data  filter  enabling 
downsampling of an initially very large dataset into a human analysable 
subset - in our case containing 0.5% of the original posts. By massively 
reducing  data  volumes,  it  becomes  realistic  to  analyse  the  remaining 
data by hand to select true positives, with around one hour required for 
the  4000  or  so  candidate  posts  we  identified.  Our  workflow  thus  ad-
dresses  the  research  gap  identified  by  Burke  et  al.,  2022,  using  gen-
eralisable  methods  to  extract  target  data  from  various,  unverified 
sources to enrich data.

high individual contributions while also having the smallest number of unique users. 

4.3. Data quality 

As a final part of the data integration analysis we investigated dif-
ferences  in  the  image  properties  of  the  associated  three  platforms 
(Fig. 6). We manually labelled all images based on:

Since our workflow is designed to be generic, take advantage of the 
text and image data and combine records from citizen science reports 
with social media data, it uses a combination of a simple rule based- 
approach, existing pre-trained models and a model trained specifically 
for our target species (Fig. 2). Our approach is designed to take advan-
tage  of  what  we  assume  to  be  high  quality  data  collected  by  citizen 
scientists with an interest in ornithology, use off-the-shelf models where 
possible, and reduce the initial number of social media posts in a given 
region to a manageable size for manual verification. Our workflow thus:
