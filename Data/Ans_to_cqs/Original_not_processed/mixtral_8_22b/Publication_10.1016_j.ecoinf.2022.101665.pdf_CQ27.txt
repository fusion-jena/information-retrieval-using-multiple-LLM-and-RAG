prediction and training points.

mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

simulated fields the map accuracy metrics were computed (see Section 
2.3),  after  which  the  means  were  computed  from  the  sampling 
distributions.
