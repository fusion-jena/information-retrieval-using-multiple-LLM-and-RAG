%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The given sources discuss various aspects such as camera settings, data splitting, image tiling, and references to other research papers but do not mention any specific cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on the available information.
