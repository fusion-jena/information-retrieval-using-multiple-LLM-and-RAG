analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

Mediterranean  forest  ecosystems.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  most 
extensive database of macrofungal productivity in the world.

Model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model 
using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared 
error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation 
(Roberts et al., 2017) with ten folds, as implemented in the R package 
“mlr3mbo” (Kotlarski et al., 2014). The search space of optimal hyper-
parameters was defined by the ranges of “mtry”  (number of variables 
randomly sampled as candidates at each split), “min.node.size”  (mini-
mum size of terminal nodes), and “num.trees” (number of trees to grow) 
shown  in  Table  S3  (the  abbreviations  of  the  hyperparameters  used 
correspond to the terminology used in the R package “ranger”).

Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does indicate that one metric used is the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. This is done through Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the RMSE of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state that other common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall are used, we can confirm that RMSE is indeed utilized.
