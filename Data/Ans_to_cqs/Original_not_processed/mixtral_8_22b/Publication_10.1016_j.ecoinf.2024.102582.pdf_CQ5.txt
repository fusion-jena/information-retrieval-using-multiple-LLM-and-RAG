5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

(1)  The dataset of long-term images for the study area containing few 
clouds  was  constructed.  The  GEE  platform  was  used  to  select 
Landsat-5  Thematic  Mapper  (TM)  and  Landsat-8  Operational 
Land Imager (OLI) images from June to September in each typical 
year (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020). The 
CloudScoreRange was then set to 5 and images meeting set con-
ditions were spliced to generate cloud-free images in each typical 
year for the study area.

Landsat is the longest running operational system of platforms col-
lecting images of the Earth surface. Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 have com-
parable  sensors:  Thematic  Mapper  (TM),  Enhanced  Thematic  Mapper 
(ETM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land 
Imager (OLI). Multiple remote sensing images (125–130 paths, 45–48 
rows)  from  Landsat  5  TM,  Landsat  7  ETM+,  and  Landsat  8  OLI  are 
available from the Historic Satellite Data Archive of GEE, and are suit-
able for mapping the spatial distribution of mangrove forests since the 
1980s. We used GEE datasets and scripts for mangrove pattern moni-
toring. Approximately three to six annual images are available for the 
southeastern coastal zone of China, with 30-m spatial resolution and a 
16-day  revisit  time.  We  selected  a  total  of  342  cloudless  images  for 
processing  based  on  the  World  Geodetic  System  1984  (WGS84) 
geographical  coordinate  system  and  Universal  Transverse  Mercator

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI images for mapping the spatial distribution of mangrove forests. These images are part of the Historic Satellite Data Archive of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study also uses approximately three to six annual images for the southeastern coastal zone of China, with a 30-meter spatial resolution and a 16-day revisit time. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that they likely involve these Landsat images obtained through GEE.
