An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues regarding the types of images used in certain studies. For instance, one study mentioned using an image set consisting of ten images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora stained with SR2200, which is available at <https://github.com/hsueh-lab/FFT>. Another study used an image set previously employed in other research, such as (Lopez-Molina et al., 2015; Shokouh et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019). Additionally, Sharma et al. (2017) worked with karyotyping images of chromosomes obtained through crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, none of these datasets correspond to well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
