reusable the least compliant. Although for each principle there were also 
repositories that scored higher than others, with Zenodo, Dryad, and Ag 
Data Commons again the best scorers, the degradation observed from 
findable to reusable was observed in all repositories. Translated to the 
content metrics, while data and metadata reached a minimum level of

3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

6. Conclusions 

addressing  data  quality.  For  this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  continue 
developing metrics such as the one proposed by F-UJI and methodolo-
gies  such  as  the  one  proposed  in  this  study  that  favour  not  only  the 
availability of data but also that they are really useful to use, share, and 
reuse. 

Regarding F-UJI, as mentioned by its creators, it is a continuously 
developing tool. Automatic testing of research data objects is based on 
the FAIR ecosystem, and its success depends on automatic testing with 
clear criteria that can be evaluated using machines.

%Query
Query: "What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query as the given pieces of context do not contain any information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are techniques used during training to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or randomly dropping out neurons. However, without more specific details related to the context, I am unable to give a detailed response.
