Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

We  classified  all  the  input  dataset combinations  (10  variable  sets; 
Table  2)  with  each  classifier  (RF,  SVM,  MARS)  and  with  two  sets  of 
classes (7C and 13C); thus, we had 60 models as a result of the classi-
fications. Classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in 
R  4.2  (R  Core  Team,  2023)  with  the  caret  package  (Kuhnaut  et  al., 
2022). 

2.4. Accuracy assessment

During  our  work,  we  discovered  several  challenges  in  identifying 
plant  populations  using  remote  sensing  in  the  field.  Moritake  et  al. 
(2024) also faced challenging problems during their studies classifying 
vegetation by human observers versus deep learning classifiers, in our 
results we also highlight the importance of involving machine learning 
techniques to gain better accuracy. While it is not difficult to survey and 
assess populations in deeper oligotrophic lakes in cooler climates, where 
the species and phenology are predominantly monospecific, the situa-
tion is different in shallow and eutrophic water bodies. In these areas, 
the simultaneous presence of several phenophases and numerous other 
plant  species  can result in  large variations  in  plant  populations, even 
within a small area. In their studies Granados et al. (2013) also identified 
different  phenological  stages  of  plant  communities,  however  they

(Conrad et al., 2015). The optimal segment size was chosen based on the 
extent of the patches, without losing any elements of the species pattern. 
The mean values of the segments were used for classification. Segments 
are  optimal  to  avoid  spatial  autocorrelation  when  using  k-fold  cross- 
validation  (KCV)  in  the  model-building  and/or  accuracy  assessment 
phase.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does discuss various strategies employed to enhance the performance of the classifiers used in the study. These include training data augmentation, post-classification methods like segmentation and filtering, dealing with geometry of training data, exclusion of outliers, refinement of training samples, and adjustment of proportions between training and testing data. Additionally, the authors utilized R software along with the caret package for conducting classifications and hyperparameter tuning. It should be noted that while these approaches contribute to improving classification accuracy, they do not directly correspond to traditional data annotation techniques typically associated with deep learning pipelines.
