Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

This paper proposes a water quality monitoring system based on a 
deep learning model, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), with the aim of improving 
the  performance  of  existing  monitoring  systems  using  the  swimming 
behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator. The LSTM model is 
a representative deep learning model used for learning and predicting 
time-series  data,  such  as  streamflow  forecasting  or  water  pollution 
detection in the field of ecological informatics (Dehghani et al., 2023; 
Guo et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). In contrast to previous studies that 
focused on only one specific pollutant, this research used formaldehyde 
and  benzene,  representative  environmental  pollutants,  each  at  a  con-
centration of 0.1 mg/L. The system's input utilized features representing 
the swimming behavior of nematodes recorded by a CCD camera and 
expressed as Branch Length Similarity (BLS) entropy.
