Tmin < Tmax

The loss factor C must satisfy: 
C1) C(t, h) ≥ 1 for every (t, h) ∈ DT × DH. 
C2) If t↦Tmin  then C(t, h)↦∞. 
C3) If t↦Tmax  and h↦0 then C(t, h)↦1. 
The first condition (C1) is determined by the model itself, while the 
remaining conditions are intrinsically linked to specific factors associ-
ated with the spread of wildfires, as depicted in Fig. 1. In essence, when 
the  temperature  is  close  to  Tmin,  the  expansion  is  unlikely  to  persist. 
However,  if  the  land  is  suffering  drought  conditions  (h ≈ 0),  the 
expansion is more prone to progress rapidly. 

Humidity  and temperature work  in reverse: for  small temperature 
values, the loss factor increases (as well as for large humidity values, 
although to a lesser extent). However, under conditions of extreme heat 
and dryness, the loss factor tends to be 1. We consider the function f 
defined as follows: 

f (t) =

(t (cid:0) Tmin)α,

α ≥ 0, t > Tmin

accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices, among others, to compre-
hensively assess the performance and effectiveness of our model. 

Specifically,  the  use  of  confusion  matrices  will  provide  us  with 
detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications 
made  by  our  model.  This  valuable  insight  will  enable  us  to  identify 
potential  deficiencies  in  classifying  specific  classes  or  categories.  In 
conclusion,  we  will  present  the  evaluation  results  through  the  use  of 
figures  and  numerical  data.  Graphical  visualizations  will  effectively 
portray the performance estimation achievement.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., during the training process. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it can indicate that the model has learned all it can from the training data, suggesting that training could be stopped. Additionally, early stopping techniques can also be employed to prevent overfitting and halt training once the model starts performing worse on the validation set.
