Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithms’ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

exploring the parameter space using randomized grid search methods 
(Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). This approach helps strike a balance be-
tween model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or type of the artificial neural network (ANN) used in this study. However, it mentions that ANNs have been employed in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and freshwater ecology. Given that the study focuses on water quality parameters like chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, and total suspended solids, it can be inferred that the ANN might be used for regression tasks related to predicting these parameters based on remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI satellites. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the architecture and objective function of the ANN, we cannot definitively determine its exact purpose within the scope of classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
