ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network model that uses skip 
connections,  which  made  it  possible  to  get  good  performance  with 
deeper models than was previously possible (He et al., 2015). Training 
deep neural networks can result in exploding gradients, and skip con-
nections  were  introduced  to  ameliorate  that  problem.  ResNet-50  was 
chosen  for  comparison  as  it  is  a  proven  CV  classification  model.  It  is 
commonly used and provides a well-performing baseline. 

Inception-V3  is  a  convolutional  neural  network  used  for  image 
classification, that has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer 
(Szegedy et al., 2015b). The Inception-V3 architecture is built on pre-
vious Inception models, with the aim of making the V3 computationally

For fine-tuning, we used the HuggingFace implementations of ViT 
(“google/vit-hugepatch14–224-in21k”) and ResNet (“microsoft/resnet- 
50”)  but  the  Keras  implementation  of  Inception-V3.  All  fine-tuning 
models  had  been  pre-trained  on  the  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009) 
dataset. 

We replaced the classifier head on all models so that it received the 
output of the models along with the additional parameters, quarters and 
length. We also tried adding additional dropout and dense layers at the 
end of the Inception model as for the DeepOtolith model Politikos et al. 
(2021). To differentiate we use Deep Otolith Inception-V3 for the model

The Inception-V3 model accepts images resized to (299, 299) pixels 
but ViT and ResNet resize to (224, 224) pixels. Dataset imbalance was 
dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. 
For the training we used AdamW optimizer for Hugging Face models, 
which is the default optimizer in the transformers library by Hugging-
Face. For Inception-V3, we used Adam since that was the optimizer used 
in  previous  work  (and  AdamW  is  not  available  in  Keras).  We  used  a 
(cid:0) 4  for 
batch  size  of  16  examples  and  the  learning  rate  was  set  to  10
(cid:0) 5  for  Vanilla  Inception-V3  and  ViT.  For  Deep  Otolith 
ResNet  but  10
(cid:0) 4 as suggested by Politikos 
Inception we used a learning rate of 4 × 10
et  al.  (2021).  For  every  fine-tuning  experiment,  the  model  with  the 

smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions using the HuggingFace implementations of ViT and ResNet, and the Keras implementation of Inception-V3. This suggests that the models might have been implemented using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as both these libraries support HuggingFace and Keras APIs. Specifically, HuggingFace supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch backends, while Keras is a high-level API that runs on top of TensorFlow. Therefore, it can be inferred that the models could have been built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on the backend chosen for each implementation.
