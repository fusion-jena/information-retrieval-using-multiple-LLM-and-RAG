Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’.

gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

2. Methods 

2.1. Biophys sensors description 

Biophys sensors were developed at the Royal Netherlands Institute 
for  Sea  Research  (NIOZ) as  long-term standalone data  logging instru-
ment  that  can  be  used  for  measuring  valve-gaping  (using  magnetism 
/hall  effect  sensor  -  DRV5053VAQLPGM),  water  pressure  (pressure 
sensor  -  MS580314BA01–00)  and  temperature  (temperature  sensor  - 
TSIC506F).  The  valve-gaping  measurement  is  based  on  hall-sensor 
measurements. All sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sen-
sors. A full description of sensors and data processing to convert sensor 
output to valve gape amplitude can be found in Bertolini et al. (2021c).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The method utilized for collecting raw data in this case is through the use of biophys sensors developed at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). These sensors are designed as long-term standalone data logging instruments capable of measuring valve-gaping using magnetism/hall effect sensor (DRV5053VAQLPGM), water pressure (pressure sensor - MS580314BA01–00), and temperature (temperature sensor - TSIC506F). The valve-gaping measurement is based on hall-sensor measurements. All sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sensors. More detailed information about the sensors and data processing to convert sensor output to valve gape amplitude can be found in Bertolini et al. (2021c).
