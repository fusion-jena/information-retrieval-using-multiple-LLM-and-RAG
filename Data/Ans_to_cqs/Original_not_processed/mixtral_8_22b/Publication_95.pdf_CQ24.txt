When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

The following three-step data augmentation procedure was applied to the images dur-
ing training before being processed by the network: (1) randomly ﬂip image horizontally,
(2) scale the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2, and (3)
randomly crop the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

Helpful Answer:
In this context, there isn't explicit mention of specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, we can infer some strategies based on the described process.

Firstly, the use of a validation set allows for monitoring the performance of the network during training and helps prevent overfitting. This indirectly addresses the issue of randomness because even if the initial weights of the network are randomly initialized, the validation set provides a way to evaluate the network's generalization ability.

Secondly, the application of data augmentation techniques introduces controlled variability into the dataset, which can help mitigate the effects of randomness. In this case, horizontal flipping, scaling contrast, and cropping are used. These transformations increase the diversity of the training data without altering its semantic content, making the model more robust to variations in the input data.

Lastly, the choice of the best performing model based on validation set accuracy after each epoch also contributes to handling randomness. By selecting the model with the highest validation accuracy, the impact of any potential negative effects caused by random initialization or other sources of randomness is minimized.

However, it should be noted that these strategies do not directly address the management of random seeds. Typically, setting a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility in experiments involving random processes like weight initialization, shuffling datasets, etc. But since this aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer regarding how random seed values are handled in this particular scenario.
