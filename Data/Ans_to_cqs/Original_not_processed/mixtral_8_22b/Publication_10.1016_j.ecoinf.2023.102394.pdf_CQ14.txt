The  parameter  selection  was  performed  by  minimizing  the  mean 
squared  error.  The parameter  settings  of the  MLP  model are  listed  in 
Table 2.

2.3. Methods 

The overall design of the study is shown in Fig. 2. This is divided into 
five parts: covariate balance optimization, model development, model 
projection, assessment of variable importance, and model evaluation.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the method used for selecting the optimal parameters for the model is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. Unfortunately, without further details about the specific methods employed during the parameter selection process, such as whether a grid search, random search, or another technique was utilized, I am unable to provide a more precise response.
