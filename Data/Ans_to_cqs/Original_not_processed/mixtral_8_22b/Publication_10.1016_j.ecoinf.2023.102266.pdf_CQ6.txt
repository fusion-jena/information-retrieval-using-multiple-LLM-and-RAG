b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

makes our model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena 
such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, since we take into 
account the most important variables in the representation.

Fig.  7  represents  in  Log  scale  the  probability  of  getting  the  Von 
Neumann dynamics according to n, with p0 = 0.5. We observe that the 
probability  decreases  when  n  increases,  so  even  though  such  a  seed 
exists,  it  is  computationally  expensive  to  find  it. Moreover,  thanks to 
Property 4.3 we can deduce that the optimal value for getting this dy-
namic also depends on the grid size and is

Thus, we can conclude that for a sufficiently large n, the probability 
of obtaining the Von Neumann model is sure. Therefore, some random 
seed  exists  for  which  our  model  and  the  Von  Neumann  model  are 
equivalent. □ 

Property 4.3. Let N be an odd integer such that N = 2n + 1, and let 
the tuple of model parameters be 

Γ = (P , C, p0) = ({0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, c, p0), c⩾1, ΔID = 1 and p0 ∈ [0, 1].

Then, the probability pvn  of obtaining the Von Neumann dynamics 

depends on n and p0, and its expression is given by

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically performed on the input data to ensure better performance and faster convergence during training. These steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data from the dataset. It involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling the features to bring them within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This step helps prevent any feature dominance due to their scales and improves the stability of gradient descent algorithms used in training. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, and mean normalization.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones to help the model learn more effectively. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, and binning continuous features.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for use in deep learning models. Techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding are commonly employed.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is utilized to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during development. Finally, the test set assesses the final model's generalization ability.

These preprocessing steps aim to prepare the data for efficient and effective training of deep learning models. However, the exact steps required depend on the nature of the problem, the type of data available, and the chosen architecture of the deep learning model.
