time (Fig. 6a, b). In this case, the onset of spring migration appeared to
be April 22 when the bird had the migrating state (with the label “2”)
and started to move northward (with increasing latitude). This kind of
inference at individual levels is diﬃcult to make through direct ob-
servations or tracking by human observers due to high ﬂying speed or
mobility of the pelicans. The state-switching state space model does not
explicitly model step length with a statistical distribution, whereas
hidden Markov models use Weibull or gamma distributions to model
step lengths. Although hidden Markov models do not account for ob-
servational error in location estimates, hidden Markov models are still a
promising tool for the behavioral segmentation of animal movement
paths with the increasingly improved accuracy of location estimation

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
