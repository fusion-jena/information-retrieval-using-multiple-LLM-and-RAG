NDVI data. Chu et al. (2021a) introduced an adaptive spatial-temporal
tensor completion method (ST Sensor) to fill gaps in the NDVI time se-
ries in cloud- and fog-prone areas. Chen et al. (2021) combined gap-
filling and an SG filter to reconstruct high-quality Landsat NDVI time
series data. These methods focused on algorithmic approaches to fill
missing periods or address weather-related occlusions in NDVI data,
successfully repairing and reconstructing missing data to achieve high-
quality NDVI dense-time-series reconstructions of MODIS and Landsat
data at the spatial scale (Chu et al., 2021b; Yao et al., 2023; Zeng et al.,
2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the deep-learning enhanced fusion methods mentioned in the paper by Wang et al. (2023). Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. However, some commonly used deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. To find out which framework was used in this particular study, further research would be required.
