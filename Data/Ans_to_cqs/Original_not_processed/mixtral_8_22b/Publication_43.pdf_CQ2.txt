Deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, are generally trained based on the prediction loss
minimization. Let x and y be the input images and corresponding output class labels, the objective of
the training is to iteratively minimize the average loss deﬁned as

J(w) =

N

N
∑
i=1

L( f (w; xi), yi) + λR(w)

This loss function measures how different is the output of the ﬁnal layer from the ground truth.
N is the number of data instances (mini-batch) in every iteration, L is the loss function, f is the
predicted output of the network depending on the current weights w, and R is the weight decay with
the Lagrange multiplier λ. It is worth mentioning that in the case of GoogLeNet, the losses of the

The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights.

improvement techniques such as data-augmentation and transfer-learning, which allow reutilization
of the knowledge acquired from a set of images into other new images. Currently, the most commonly
used software implementing CNNs is the open source library of Tensorﬂow by GoogleTM ([18]),
which requires programming skills since it does not have a graphical user-interface.

In this work, we considered the two most accurate CNNs, ResNet ([42]) and GoogLeNet ([43]).
ResNet won the ﬁrst place on the 2015 ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition
(ILSVRC)) and is currently the most accurate and deepest CNN available. It has 152 layers and
25.5 million parameters. Its main characteristic with respect to the previous CNNs is that ResNet
creates multiple paths through the network within each residual module. GoogLeNet won the ﬁrst
place of the 2014 ILSVRC. GoogLeNet is based on inception v3 and has 23.2 million parameters and
22 layers with learnable weights organized in four parts: (i) the initial segment, made up of three
convolutional layers, (ii) nine inception v3 modules, where each module is a set of convolutional and
pooling layers at different scales performed in parallel then concatenated together, (iii) two auxiliary
classiﬁers, where each classiﬁer is actually a smaller convolutional network put on the top of the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The provided context primarily discusses the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet and GoogLeNet for image classification tasks. These networks are typically trained using image datasets, where each image is associated with its respective class label. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. However, the context does not explicitly mention any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being utilized in the discussed deep learning pipelines.
