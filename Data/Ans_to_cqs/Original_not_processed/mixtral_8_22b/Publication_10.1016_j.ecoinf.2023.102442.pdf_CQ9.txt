2.2. Data and platforms 

The initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine 
(GEE),  a  cloud  processing  platform  which  provides  a  public  catalog 
containing  petabytes  of  satellite  imagery  and  geospatial  datasets, 
allowing for high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and 
analysis  of  images.  The  platform  allows  for  access,  selection,  and

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given context about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It is recommended to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more information regarding the availability of the data repository.
