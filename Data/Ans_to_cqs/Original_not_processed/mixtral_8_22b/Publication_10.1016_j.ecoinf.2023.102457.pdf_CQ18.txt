of length 2048. Model and code was run in Python version 3.10 based on 
the code and methods presented in: https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET 
-Analyzer.

The second approach we used to extract embeddings was from the 
pre-trained  BirdNET  model.  The  original  version  of  the  model  was

capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by 
sound (Kahl et al., 2021). BirdNET was trained using a dataset derived 
from  three  primary  sources:  eBird,  Xeno-canto,  and  the  Macaulay  Li-
brary  of  Natural  Sounds.  We  used  BirdNET  version  2.4  which  was 
trained on over 6000 bird and non-bird species (https://github.com/kah 
st/BirdNET-Analyzer). The task-specific model architecture of BirdNET 
was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) (Kiyokawa 
et al., 2019), that consists of 157 layers with >27 million parameters, 
and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and 
mixup. BirdNET creates a mel-scale spectrogram between 150 Hz and 
15 kHz and returns 1024 embeddings per 3-s of audio sample. As with 
the VGGish model, we took the mean and standard deviation for em-
beddings over the entire duration of the call, resulting in a feature vector

Using supervised classification, BirdNET returned the highest accu-
racy of 98.2% ± 0.85 SD at 0 m. MFCCs and BirdNET performed simi-
larly at closer distances while MFCCs returned the highest classification 
accuracies at farther distances (> 150 m) with a minimum classification 
accuracy  of  39.8%  ± 4.3  SD  at  300  m.  In  comparison  with  BirdNET, 
VGGish and Wav2Vec 2.0 performed less well with VGGish and Wav2-
Vec 2.0 returning maximum accuracies of respectively 76.4% ± 2.3 SD 
and 52.7% ± 3 SD at 0 m. Acoustic indices performed the least well with 
classification accuracies ranging between 17.1% ± 2.8 SD and 37.9% ±
2.5  SD.  The  classification  accuracies  decrease  across  distance  for  all 
feature extraction methods (Fig. 4).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that some form of monitoring was done due to the reported accuracy results. Typically, when training deep learning models like BirdNET, several strategies are employed to monitor their performance. These may include tracking metrics such as loss or accuracy on validation datasets, visualizing the learning process through tools like TensorBoard, or implementing early stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting. Additionally, cross-validation techniques might have been utilized to ensure robustness and generalizability of the model. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding these aspects, it remains uncertain what exact strategies were adopted for this particular case.
