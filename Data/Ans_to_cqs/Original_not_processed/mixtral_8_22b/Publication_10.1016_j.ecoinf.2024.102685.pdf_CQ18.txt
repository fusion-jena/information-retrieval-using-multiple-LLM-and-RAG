present, namely (1) Z. marina, (2) N. noltei, (3) C. nodosa, (4) absence 
(hereafter  indicated  as  species  meadows).  The  species  presence  was 
considered if its cover was >20% (Buia et al., 2004). For each dataset, 4

The workflow adopted for data acquisition, preparation and to set RF 
models are summarized in Fig. 2. The field data were collected during 
the summer season in 2010 (see Boscutti et al., 2015 for details about the 
field sampling procedure). The presence or absence and the cover per-
centage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling 
point, by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. To reduce the 
effects  introduced  by  non-vegetated  and  mixed  pixels,  the  points  not 
falling within the region of interest (ROI) (i.e. main channels and tidal 
islands  of  the  lagoon), and  the  points  considered  mixed  (i.e.  those in 
which  the  co-occurrence  of  multiple  species  was  recorded),  were 
removed. The removed mixed points represented 16.7% of the original 
data.  Considering  the different  combinations of  the three  species’  co-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study involves using random forest classification models for monitoring seagrass species in the Mediterranean Sea. However, there is no explicit information regarding the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided context. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or resources related to this study to determine the exact methodology employed for monitoring the model performance during training.
