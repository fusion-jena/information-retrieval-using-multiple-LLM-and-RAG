To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Pachauri 
et al., 2014) provided multiple Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs)  for  predicting  climate  change  under  different  greenhouse  gas 
emission trajectories. We constructed habitat suitability models of the 
three species under the RCP2.6 (low emission) and RCP8.5 (high emis-
sion)  scenarios  using  the  same  modeling  method  and  with  the  same 
habitat variables described above. The predicted current niche models 
were projected into future climate conditions to identify range shifts in

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the model's performance.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning algorithms often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This process is known as normalization. Standardization, another form of scaling, transforms the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Both techniques help prevent attributes with larger magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones during training.

3. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to the prediction task. Some features might even degrade the model's performance due to noise or redundancy. Therefore, selecting relevant features can significantly enhance the model's efficiency and effectiveness. Techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or wrapper methods can aid feature selection.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Neural networks require numeric inputs. Hence, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical representations. One common technique is one-hot encoding where each category becomes a binary column. Another popular method is label encoding, assigning unique integers to categories.

5. Data Augmentation: In some cases, especially with image datasets, generating new samples by applying random but realistic transformations (like rotation, zoom, flip etc.) can increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

These preprocessing steps aim to prepare the raw data into a suitable format for feeding into the deep learning algorithm, thereby improving its ability to learn meaningful patterns and generalize well to unseen data.
