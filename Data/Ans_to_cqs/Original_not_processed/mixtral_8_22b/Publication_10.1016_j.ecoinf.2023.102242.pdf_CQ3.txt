2.10. Random forest classification 

A  similar  approach  was  followed  for  the  object-oriented  random 
forest  classification,  employing  optimal  features  from  three  separate 
segmentation layers (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012). This process also 
involved  the  transfer  of  object  data  from  Levels  1  and  2  to  facilitate 
classification at Level 3. The aggregation of all object data resulted in the 
complete classification result (Puissant et al., 2014). The outcomes of 
this classification for high-resolution images from 2020 and 2021 are 
illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions several research papers related to object detection, semantic segmentation, and object-oriented classification methods. These methods might involve various data annotation techniques depending on their requirements.

For example, Girshick et al.'s paper discusses rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation [1], which could potentially use bounding boxes or pixel-level annotations for training models. Similarly, Hadlich et al.'s work focuses on recognizing Amazonian tree species using bark tissue spectra [2], possibly involving image labeling or other forms of annotation.

Furthermore, the context refers to a study by Xu et al. on object-oriented classification using ERC-forests and Rainfalling watershed algorithms [3] and another one by Hu on extracting non-commercial forest plots dynamic change based on object-oriented classification [4]. Both studies may require different types of data annotation techniques tailored to their respective applications.

Lastly, the text describes a random forest classification approach employed for object-oriented classification, utilizing optimal features from multiple segmentation layers [5]. While this doesn't explicitly mention any particular data annotation technique, it suggests that some form of labeled data is necessary for training these classifiers.

Overall, while the given context does not directly address the query regarding specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it provides insights into various object detection, segmentation, and classification methods that might utilize different annotation strategies like bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or others.
