presented in Section 4.2, the OA of EXP3 (85.19%), based on the mul-
tiple  probabilistic  classification  model,  surpassed  that  of  EXP1

research reaffirms the efficacy of the multiple probabilistic classification 
model for enhancing the LULC classification mapping accuracy. Similar

undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might include metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation.

In this study, several experiments (EXP1 - EXP5) were conducted using different models and approaches for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification mapping. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient. This is evident from Figures 7 and 9, which compare the classification results from different experiments and tile sizes based on OA and Kappa. Additionally, Figure 8 shows a spatial comparison of land categories between classification results from EXP1 to EXP5.

These evaluations suggest that postprocessing steps likely included calculating metrics like OA and Kappa to assess the performance of each experiment. Furthermore, generating a confusion matrix could also be a possible postprocessing step, as it provides insights into the misclassifications made by the models.

However, without more specific details regarding the postprocessing steps mentioned in the research, it cannot be confirmed whether saliency maps or other advanced visualization techniques were used. Therefore, while we can infer that metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation were probable postprocessing steps, the involvement of additional methods remains uncertain based solely on the provided context.
