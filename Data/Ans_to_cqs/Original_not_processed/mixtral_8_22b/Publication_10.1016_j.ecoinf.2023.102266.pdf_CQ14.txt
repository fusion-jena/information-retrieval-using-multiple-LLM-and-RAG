Property 4.2. Let N, K ∈ N and model parameters 

P = {0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, c⩾1, ΔID = 1 and p0 = 0.5  

then some random seed value exists for which our spread model is equal

Thus, we can conclude that for a sufficiently large n, the probability 
of obtaining the Von Neumann model is sure. Therefore, some random 
seed  exists  for  which  our  model  and  the  Von  Neumann  model  are 
equivalent. □ 

Property 4.3. Let N be an odd integer such that N = 2n + 1, and let 
the tuple of model parameters be 

Γ = (P , C, p0) = ({0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, c, p0), c⩾1, ΔID = 1 and p0 ∈ [0, 1].

Then, the probability pvn  of obtaining the Von Neumann dynamics 

depends on n and p0, and its expression is given by

Moreover, the computational cost grows exponentially with the in-
crease  in  the  number  of  variables  in  the  model  and  the  grid  size  for 
analysis. Despite the potential for parallelization to improve efficiency, 
obtaining accurate results under such circumstances can be challenging 
due to computational demands. 

A  critical  consideration  involves  the  estimator  used  in  the  Monte 
Carlo method, which relies on the average of test results Eq. 6. However, 
it is noteworthy that this estimator may not always minimize variance. 
This observation presents an opportunity for future research to explore 
techniques for variance reduction, see Section 6.

b.Modification  of  the  update  criterion  and  application  of  ma-
chine learning: We will seek to improve our model by modifying the 
update  criterion,  maintaining  stochasticity  but  making  it  differen-
tiable. This will allow us to take advantage of machine-learning tools 
and turn our model into an intelligent cellular automaton. 
c.Optimising  the  scope:  We  will  make  changes  in  the  partitions 
used to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration. This 
will become another adjustable parameter to improve the accuracy 
and efficiency of the model. 
d.Strategies of variance-reduction: As previously mentioned, the 
estimator  given  by  Eq.  6  may  not  have  the  minimum  variance. 
Therefore, it opens the possibility to investigate and develop new and 
more sophisticated estimators by using variance reduction strategies 
such as the importance sampling, stratified sampling, Quasi-Monte

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, there are several points in the text that suggest possible optimization techniques. For instance, the use of a random seed value implies that different combinations of hyperparameters could be tested to find the best fit. Additionally, the mention of adjustable parameters indicates that the model allows for tuning various aspects to achieve optimal performance. Furthermore, the discussion about increasing the number of cells exposed in each iteration suggests that the model might involve iterative processes where hyperparameters are adjusted over time. Lastly, the reference to machine learning tools hints at the possibility of employing advanced optimization algorithms commonly used in machine learning applications. In conclusion, while the specific optimization technique is not stated, the context provides clues suggesting that the model likely uses some form of hyperparameter tuning, potentially involving iterative processes and machine learning algorithms.
