The  selected  network  models  were  initialized  with  pre-
trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to our datasets. 
The performance of a deep neural network for a dataset highly 
depends on network hyperparameters. The selection and fine-
tuning of  optimized hyperparameters  is  generally  a  difficult 
and  time-consuming  task.  Instead  of  manually  selecting  the 
hyperparameters, we employed Bayesian optimization to find 
their optimal values for each of the six models.  A Gaussian 
process  model  of  the  objective  function  is  used  by  the 
Bayesian optimization technique.  Different variables can be 
optimized using this technique such as network section depth, 
batch size, initial learning rate, momentum, and regularization 
strength. For this study, we optimized the network for batch 
size  (between  1  and  32)  and  initial  learning  rate  (between 
1×10-4  and  1×10-2).  The  optimization  was  performed  by

minimizing  the  loss  on  the  validation  dataset  to  perform 
objective function evaluations. The models were trained for a 
maximum of 10 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent 
with  a  momentum  (‘sgdm’)  optimizer.  Thus,  a  total  of  six

trained using the outputs of the six models. For each dataset, 
two stacked ensemble models were generated. The input for 
the  first  model  was  all  the  probabilities  generated  by  deep 
learning models and for the second model, it was the mean of 
these probabilities. However, there was not much  difference 
noticed in the performance of both models, so the results are 
reported  only  from  the  first  model  for  both  datasets.  The 
performance  of  the  stacked  ensemble  was  not  found  to  be 
better  than  the  other  three  ensemble  techniques  for  the 
VP_200  dataset  while  for 
the 
improvement was  slightly higher than the outputs generated 
using mean and weighted mean ensemble techniques. We also 
analyzed the performance of meta learners, and it was noticed 
that  in  most  of  the  cases  SVM  and  KNN  outperformed  the 
other  three  classifiers  as  the  meta  learners  for  both  plant 
species datasets. A comparison of all models is shown in Table

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were taken. Firstly, two diverse datasets, namely UBD_45 and VP_200, were utilized. These datasets likely contained different types of images or features, which helped improve the robustness and applicability of the models across various scenarios. Secondly, the models were initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights before being fine-tuned to these specific datasets. This transfer learning approach allowed the models to leverage previously learned features and adapt them to new tasks more efficiently. Thirdly, instead of manual selection, Bayesian optimization was employed to find the optimal hyperparameter values for each of the six models. This automated process reduced human bias and improved the overall performance of the models. Lastly, the models were trained using stochastic gradient descent with a momentum ('sgdm') optimizer for a maximum of 10 epochs. Although no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting was made, these methods could have been implicitly applied during the training phase to further enhance the generalizability of the models.
