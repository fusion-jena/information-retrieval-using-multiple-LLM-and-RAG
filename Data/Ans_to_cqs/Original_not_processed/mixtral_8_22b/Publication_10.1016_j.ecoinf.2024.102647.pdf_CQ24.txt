showed that the risk of groundwater salinity was high in the central areas of the region as well as at the margins 
of Bakhtegan Lake and irrigated farming lands. Based on the modeling results in the testing phase, it was found 
that the frequency ratio and random forest models exhibited better performance, with Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency 
metrics of 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, compared to the classification and regression trees and statistical index 
models, which had Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency metrics of 0.65 and 0.63, respectively. The innovative techniques 
developed  in  the  current  work  accurately  identified  variables  such  as  normalized  difference  salinity  index, 
distance from mines, and land use associated with the highest weight values (0.59, 0.14, and 0.11, respectively) 
compared to other variables to identify groundwater salinity areas of vulnerability. The application of the fuzzy

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about strategies used to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, based on the given context, there is no direct information or discussion related to this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.

To address the query, some common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out the effect of random initializations, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to introduce controlled randomness during model training. These strategies help improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models.
