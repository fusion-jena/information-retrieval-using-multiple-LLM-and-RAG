2.2.5. Classification 

Each  ML  approach  requires  hyperparameters  to  classify  imagery, 
which when optimized during training can increase model performance, 
see  Table  4  for  a  hyperparameter  glossary.  Given  the  computational 
efficiency of the SVMs and the few hyperparameters required, each of 
these can be optimized simply and relatively quickly (subject to dataset 
size)  during  a  k-fold  (k = 5) cross-validated  fine  grid-search  on  the 
training  data.  For  our  CNN  þ SVM  method,  we  followed  hyper-
parameter  recommendations  by  (Hsu  et  al.,  2016),  authors  of  the 
LIBSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011). For our non-linear RBF SVM we 
searched  hyperparameters  C = 23, 23.25, …, 27  and  γ = 2

The number of images you send to the model in each iteration. 
Model parameters are updated after each batch during training. 
How many times you pass the full image dataset through the model. 
The error metric that you wish to minimize. 
e.g. Cross entropy loss for multi-class classification. 
A small number (0, 1] that determines the amount to alter parameters 
during training with respect to the loss. 
Also known as the step size. 
An algorithm that modifies CNN parameters according to a particular 
strategy to minimize the loss. 
e.g. the Adam optimizer sets the learning rate adaptively for faster and 
more efficient training.

For the CNN, The large number of hyperparameters (Table 4) and 
high  computational  demand,  mean  that  an  exhaustive  grid-search  is 
inappropriate.  Instead  our  preliminary  work  showed  that  common 
default parameters, were suitable for our data. These include a batch- 
size of 32 images and a cross-entropy loss function. We also used the 
Adam learning rate optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015), which automat-
ically adjusted our initial learning rate of 1e-03 during training in a way 
that  improved  performance.  Adam  is  computationally  efficient  and 
straight-forward to use. In preliminary work, each model was set to train 
for  100  epochs  maximum.  However  for  later  time-saving  and  better 
automation, we enabled early stopping if the validation error (loss) did 
not reduce for 10 epochs. This identified a suitable number of epochs for 
each dataset: 14, 14 and 23 epochs for Datasets 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Helpful Answer:

In this study, the deep learning model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The hyperparameters used for the CNN include a batch size of 32 images, a cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam learning rate optimizer. The initial learning rate was set to 1e-03, but it was automatically adjusted during training using the Adam optimizer. Each model was initially set to train for a maximum of 100 epochs, but early stopping was implemented if the validation error did not decrease for 10 consecutive epochs. This resulted in different numbers of epochs for each dataset: 14, 14, and 23 epochs for datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
