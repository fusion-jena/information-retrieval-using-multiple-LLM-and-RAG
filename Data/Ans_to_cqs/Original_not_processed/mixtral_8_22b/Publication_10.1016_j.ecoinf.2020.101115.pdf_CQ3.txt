critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

the procedures involved in storing, uploading metadata, and imaging
samples, a high-level process flow was developed (Fig. 3). The process
flow outlines where the sample metadata is generated, analysed, and
eventually stored. Furthermore, it documents how the physical samples
and digital data are linked. This cross-disciplinary process flow is novel
because it outlines how the operational part (routine sampling of fish
for government mandated stock assessment) of an organization (the
MI), and the research capacity of an organization (imaging and reading
growth on scales and otoliths), can be interlinked. Additionally, the
management of the IFBA dataset follows the procedures and roles
outlined within the MI's Data Management Quality Framework
(Leadbetter et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help in identifying and classifying objects within images or videos, enabling machine learning models to learn patterns and make predictions.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image and labeling them accordingly. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation involves detecting individual instances of objects and their boundaries.

In the context of marine science, these techniques could potentially be applied to identify and classify different species of fish, track their movements, or analyze their growth patterns based on otoliths or other biological markers. However, without more specific information regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
