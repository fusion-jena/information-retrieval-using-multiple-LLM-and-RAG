2.5. Random Forest (RF)

The RF algorithm constructs multiple decision trees (DTs), or classiﬁers, that each
predict a class [43]. Each tree within the RF is created using different training data subsets,
which are selected through repetition and replacement of the original training dataset.
This repetition and replacement create a ‘bagged’ dataset for each of the decision trees
within the random forest. The samples that are out of the bag, the so-called out-of-bag
samples (OOB), are used for validation of the RF model. The ﬁnal prediction of the RF
is based on the majority vote from all trees. The RF model was created using the sklearn
module (scikit-learn 0.24). The number of trees and the maximum number of features
to be considered for the best split were tuned via GridSearchCV (scikit-learn 0.24) and
were found to be as follows: best number of trees = 130; maximum features required for
split = auto.

2.6. Deep Neural Network

a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 increased the testing accuracy of the model. These additional layers—dropout and batch normalization—reduce the over-fitting of the model on the training data and increase generalization on testing data. The hyperparameters in this network—the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size—were further tuned such that the testing accuracy and the kappa were the best among all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.  Figure 4.

The output layer contains 11 neurons, corresponding to the number of classes to be classified. 2.7.

worldwide should consider the needs of the local human population. As such, future conservation efforts by the MFG include improving human health and recognizing the importance of people-oriented strategies in order to provide cash crops and a sustainable food source for the locals. Machine/deep learning has been far advanced in some application domains; how-ever, challenges exist for remote sensing applications especially for tropical forest moni-toring due to in part the lack of sufficient training data representing various biomes and forest types globally that must be manually created and in part the challenges of manag-ing and analyzing big satellite data at the global scale.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding the use of random seed values. However, we can infer some strategies from the mentioned techniques used in building the deep neural network (DNN) model.

One strategy to manage randomness in DNNs is the use of dropout layers. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. By introducing randomness into the network, it forces other neurons to learn more robust features, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in input data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization layers. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, reducing internal covariate shift and allowing faster convergence. This technique also introduces some level of randomness since the mean and variance used for normalization are calculated per mini-batch.

While not explicitly stated, another common practice to control randomness in deep learning pipelines is setting a fixed random seed value. A random seed value initializes the pseudorandom number generator, ensuring reproducibility across experiments. Setting a consistent seed value allows researchers to reproduce their results and compare them accurately.

Lastly, the context discusses the optimization of hyperparameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. Hyperparameter tuning can help mitigate the effects of randomness by finding optimal configurations that improve model performance and reduce variability. Techniques such as grid search or random search can be employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

In summary, while the given context does not directly address managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline using random seed values, it implies several strategies such as employing dropout layers, utilizing batch normalization, setting a fixed random seed value, and performing hyperparameter tuning.
