2.3. NHC methodology description

There were two main data sources assembled within a database and
used for the fieldwork/analysis: (1) archaeological survey data from the
Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) (Dagan, 2006) for LTA-LU; and (2)
remotely sensed data (spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-
toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENμS), airborne Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for LC. Addi-
tional ancillary data was required for establishing research control,
georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas, including (1) digital maps
from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC (M.O.
A., 2023); (2) georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of
Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area (S.O.I.,
2018); (3) substrate data for geology, from the Israel geological survey
(I.G.S., 2010, 2016), and soil (Ravikovitch, 1969); (4) climate-related
data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S., 2023) and the US

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the deployment process of any trained deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
