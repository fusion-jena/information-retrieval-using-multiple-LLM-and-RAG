speech  recognition,  and  genomics.  As  such,  AI  algorithm 
development  is  shifting  from  programs  hand-written  by  domain 
experts, to training machines by examples – often millions of data 
points  in  the  case  of  difficult  problems  such  as  unconstrained 
image recognition [32]. The major enablers for the success of DL 
have  been  the  availability  of  large  amounts  of  data,  and  the 
corresponding  computational  infrastructure  required  by  the 
learning  algorithms.  In  comparison  to  other  ML  algorithms,  the 
performance of a DL algorithm scales very well with the number 
of  training  examples  and  the  amount  of  compute  cycles  can  be 
applied. 

The biodiversity monitoring application that we have outlined is a 
prime candidate for application of DL, due to availability of large 
amounts  of  labeled  data  produced  by  the  analysts  using  our  UI.

analysts.  Second,  using  machine  learning  (ML)  techniques,  such 
as  deep  learning  (DL),  we  progressively  train  computational 
models  to  detect  and  classify  events  of  interest,  and  reduce  the 
amount of wildlife data reviewed by human analysts by orders of 
magnitude.

The specific subfield of ML that we have invested in is known as 
Deep  Learning  (DL)  [31].  DL  is  a  quickly  growing  and  vibrant 
field;  here  we  summarize  our  use  of  DL  and  postulate  how 
biodiversity monitoring can be improved using various properties 
of DL algorithms.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that one of the major enablers for the success of Deep Learning (DL) has been the corresponding computational infrastructure required by the learning algorithms. This suggests that powerful computing resources like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) might have been employed for training the models. These types of hardware resources are commonly used for accelerating complex computations involved in deep learning tasks.
