2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm. 

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results

1. Introduction

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results 

Clustering divides data into groups based on inherent characteristics; 
not requiring external information, such as, classes which become data 
labels. Therefore, the created groups align naturally with the data con-
ditions  and  the  clustering  algorithm.  As  a  result,  the  evaluation  of 
clustering results is conducted internally, using Silhouette and Calinski- 
Harabasz.  High  evaluation  scores  on  both  methods  indicate  that  the 
clustering results obtained by the clustering method is the best outcome. 

2.8. Elbow method

to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a 
clustering approach. For each fish, we automatically identify the num-
ber  of  classes  and  their  duration,  evaluating  them  using  the  elbow 
method. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes 
subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of our findings.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

In this case, the text provides information about two postprocessing steps: clustering the freshness data and evaluating the clustering results. These steps occur after the model has been trained to predict the freshness of different species of fish.

Firstly, the data is clustered using a clustering method to determine the freshness class based on the dataset. This step involves partitioning the data into groups based on inherent characteristics, without requiring any external information or labels. The goal is to create groups that align naturally with the data conditions and the clustering algorithm.

Secondly, the clustering results are evaluated internally using Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz methods. High evaluation scores on both methods indicate that the clustering results obtained by the clustering method are the best possible outcome. Additionally, the elbow method is used to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a clustering approach. This helps to minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of the findings.

Overall, these postprocessing steps help to ensure that the model predictions are accurate and reliable, providing valuable insights into the freshness of different species of fish.
