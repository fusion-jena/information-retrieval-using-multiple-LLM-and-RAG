evaluation was done on focal and citizen-science datasets. Swaminathan
et al. (2024) extend the observation to attention-based architectures pre-
trained on human speech. Lauha et al. (2022) show that transfer
learning can be helpful also for small networks trained from scratch on
small, targeted datasets gathered from online resources such as Mac-
aulay Library2 (as opposed to foundation models trained on large
datasets). While the works cited above evaluate transfer learning models
based on classification performance, McGinn et al. (2023) take a
different approach and investigate the topology of fine grained, sub-
species sound events in the embedding space afforded by BirdNet;
they find that different call types of a same species (e.g., drumming
versus vocalization) form distinct clusters, and that the vicinity of each

both the target modality and the domain, yields the best performance as
a feature embedding model. Using BirdNet-1 as the embedding model,
active learning sample selection strategies significantly reduce the
required for annotation to achieve model
number of
convergence.

models for AnuraSet. For UMAP generation, we randomly select 5000 samples
and discard all samples that are aligned to more than one class. Colors and
shapes indicate the 10 classes with the highest occurrence frequency. Layers are
numbered according to their distance from the classification layer, e.g. ‘Bird-
Net-1’ is the last layer before the classification layer of the BirdNet model.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The deep learning model mentioned in this context is called BirdNET, which is used for avian diversity monitoring. According to the paper by Kahl et al. (2021), BirdNET is designed to perform bird species recognition using audio recordings. Therefore, its primary purpose is classification - specifically, identifying the species of birds present in a given recording. This is further supported by the fact that it has been evaluated based on classification performance in several studies, including those by Swaminathan et al. (2024) and McGinn et al. (2023).
