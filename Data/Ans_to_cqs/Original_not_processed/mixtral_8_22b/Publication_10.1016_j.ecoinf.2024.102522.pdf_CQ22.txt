Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As shown in Table 6, the correct prediction rate for “present”  was 
74.81%, the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 76.55%, 
and the overall validation accuracy was 75.68%. These results showed 
that the accuracy of the model in predicting the “present” sample points 
was >70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%, 
indicating that the model is effective (Carranza and Hale, 2000).

3.3.2. Model based on the human transmissibility index

From Table 11, the correct prediction rate for “present” was 76.84%, 
the prediction accuracy of the model for “absent” was 77.55%, and the 
overall  validation  accuracy  was  76.17%.  The  results  showed  that  the 
accuracy  of  the  model  in  predicting  the  “present”  sample  points  was 
>70%, and the accuracy of the “absent” sample points was >50%. The 
model  was  effective,  and  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  model  was 
slightly  greater  than  that  of  the  model  based  on  remote  sensing  data 
without the introduction of nighttime light information. 

3.3.3. Pattern of Hyphantria cunea spreading

percentage  higher  than  that  of  the  original  model,  and  the  overall 
improvement rate was 3.3%. This further indicated that introducing the 
human transmissibility index can improve the prediction accuracy of the 
model.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc. In this case, the authors have used the correct prediction rate or accuracy to measure the performance of their models. For instance, they mention that the correct prediction rate for 'present' was 74.81%, while the prediction accuracy of the model for 'absent' was 76.55%. They also report the overall validation accuracy which was found to be 75.68%. Similarly, for the second model, the correct prediction rates were reported as 76.84% and 77.55% for 'present' and 'absent', respectively, with an overall validation accuracy of 76.17%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors have primarily relied on the accuracy metric to assess the effectiveness of their models.
