RF)]  = [R,  a*,  b*,  shell  diameter],  composed  of  300  data-filled  rows 
collected  from  five  location  sites  in  Portugal,  stratified  sampling  was 
employed with 80% (240 data rows) used for training the model and 
20% (60 data rows) for testing. All pre-trained models under Approach 1

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the optimization algorithm used for training the model was stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). This suggests that some form of gradient-based optimization was employed. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the use of techniques such as grid search or random search, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters were optimized.
