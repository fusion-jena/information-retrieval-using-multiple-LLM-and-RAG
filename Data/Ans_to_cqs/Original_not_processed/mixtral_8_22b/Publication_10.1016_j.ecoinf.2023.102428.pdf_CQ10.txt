Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  Eq.  (6),  Cfuture  and  Ccurrent  are  the  static  C  stocks  in  future  and 
current periods, respectively. The required data to run the model were 
current  and  future  LULC  maps  and  biophysical  table  in  CSV_format 
containing  the  columns:  ‘C_above’,  ‘C_below’,  ‘C_soil’,  and  ‘C_dead’ 
(Table 3). The C-pool data were acquired from the InVEST user guide 
(Adelisardou  et  al.,  2022)  and  a  meta-analysis  of  various  published 
documents (Liang et al., 2017; Piyathilake et al., 2022; Tao et al., 2023), 
assuming  that  C-densities  in  each  pool  have  not  changed  over  the 
different scenarios (from 1995 to 2035). Finally, the Cstorage  is calculated 
in dense forest, open forest, agriculture, grassland, barren land, water 
bodies, and built-up areas to monitor and project the dynamics of CS & S 
in  AWLS  during  1995–2035.  The  other  land  use  classes,  such  as 
degraded land, snow cover, and sand bar, are reported to contain less

missions under the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC). 
Moreover, the National Mission for a Green India under NAPCC also puts 
special emphasis on the forestry sector for enhancing the resilience and 
adaptation capacity of forests against climate change (Negi, 2018).

2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic
