Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

From our own experience, we frequently observe that CNN output is

2.3. Implementation and training 

The  CNN  was  implemented  using  the  Keras  (Chollet,  2015)  and 
TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.,  2016)  software  packages  implemented  in 
Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and 
CuDNN  with  Nvidia  (Nvidia  Corp.,  Santa  Clara,  California)  P100 
accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. We used a Keras imple-
mentation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 (https://github. 
com/qubvel/efficientnet).  The  pre-trained  weights  used  for  transfer 
learning were available through this API.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the implementation and training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were done using Python programming language along with the use of Keras and TensorFlow libraries. Furthermore, computations were carried out utilizing CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards having 12GB of GPU memory. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being utilized for deployment of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
