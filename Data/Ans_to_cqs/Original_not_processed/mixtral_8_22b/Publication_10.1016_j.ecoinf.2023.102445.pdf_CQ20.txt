Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.1.1. Experimental equipment and environment 

In  this  paper,  all  the  experiments  are  conducted  on  a  consistent 
experimental  platform.  The  platform  uses  an  AMD  Ryzen  7  5800H 
processor with a Radeon graphics operating at 3.20 GHz. The graphics 
card is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4 GB of video 
memory.  The  development  environment  consists  of  the  Windows  10 
Enterprise operating system. The software environment included Python 
version 3.7, CUDA version 11.6 and PyTorch deep learning framework 
version 1.12.0. 

2.1.2. Video acquisition

input into the model network for training.

2.2.6. Experimental design 

In this paper, a sequence of 10 ablation experiments are conducted 
and labelled to evaluate the enhancements made to various components 
of the network architecture. These experiments use 10 different network 
models,  of  which  the  model  of  Experiment  1  is  the  original  YOLOv8 
model, and the remaining nine models are models with different struc-
tures modified on the basis of YOLOv8. 

The experimental training parameter settings are as follows: a batch 
size of 16 is selected, the input image resolution is set at 640 × 640, and 
the number of epochs is specified as 150. The learning rate is set to 0.01, 
and the optimizer is Adam. Additionally, the depth_scale parameter is 
assigned a value of 0.33, while the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25.

enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

Helpful Answer:

The experiments are conducted on a consistent experimental platform that uses an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor with a Radeon graphics operating at 3.20 GHz. The graphics card used is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4 GB of video memory. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include both CPUs (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H) and GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti).
