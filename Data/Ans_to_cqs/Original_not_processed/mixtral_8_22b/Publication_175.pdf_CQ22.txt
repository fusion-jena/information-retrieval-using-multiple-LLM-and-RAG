3. Results 

The  deep  ResNet  model  trained  on  the  large  AT0  dataset  (3458 
natural thumbnails in average per species) during the first experiment 
obtained a mean accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct classification) of 
78.00%  (standard  deviation  (SD)  of  15.16%)  on  T2  test-dataset 
(Table  2).  With  this  model,  accuracy  varied  among  species  between 
54.14% (Naso brevirostris) and 99.07% (Abudefduf vagiensis). The same

1)  We  trained  a  classic  DL  algorithms  architecture  with  our  biggest 

dataset AT0 as a baseline for the DL accuracy;  

2)  We  trained  the  same  DL  architecture  with  the  same  hyper- 
parameters (e.g. model architecture and training process) but on a 
much  more  limited  dataset  (AT1).  Hyper-parameters  are  the  pa-
rameters  defining  the  architecture (number of  layers, number and 
size of convolutions, connections between layers) and the training 
process  of  a  Deep  Model  (learning  rate,  neurone  activation,  back- 
propagation compotation).;  

3)  We trained the same DL architecture with limited datasets obtained 
by  subsampling  T0  to  250  and  500  images  per  class  (here  after 
“species” when we are referring to our experiments), corresponding 
to 2500 and 5000 thumbnails in AT0;

Thus, there is a trade-off to make between accuracy and robustness 
on one hand, and the cost of video annotation by experts on the other. 
Modelling the accuracy of neural networks using NLME allowed to 
understand the number of images per species required for the Few-shot 
and Deep architecture to reach 99% of their maximum potential accu-
racy. In our case study, there was a 150-fold factor between the average 
number of images required for a Deep Learning architecture (1153 im-
ages) and for a Few-shot architecture (7) to reach asymptotic accuracy. 
However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  numbers  could  vary  ac-
cording  to  the  number  and  complexity  of  classes  fed  to  the  deep 
classifier.

Helpful Answer:

The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context is mean accuracy, also referred to as the percentage of correct classification. This is calculated as the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made. In the first experiment, the deep ResNet model achieved a mean accuracy of 78.00%, with a standard deviation of 15.16%. However, it should be noted that accuracy can vary significantly among different species, ranging from 54.14% to 99.07% in this particular study. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, and F1 score, which provide additional insights into the model's performance beyond overall accuracy.
