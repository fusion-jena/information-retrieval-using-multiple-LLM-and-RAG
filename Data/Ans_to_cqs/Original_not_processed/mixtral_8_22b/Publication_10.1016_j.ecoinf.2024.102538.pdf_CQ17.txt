The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

networks  have  demonstrated  considerable  potential.  The  mainstream 
deep  learning  approach  for  sound  recognition  involves  mapping  the 
sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified 
network  architecture  adapted  from  advanced  image  recognition  for 
automatic  feature  learning.  The  effectiveness  of  convolutional  neural

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization being employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that a form of regularization has been applied through the use of weight decay, also known as L2 regularization. This can be seen where the text mentions "with a weight decay of 1 × 10". Weight decay is a technique used during optimization to penalize weights with large magnitudes, which helps prevent overfitting by keeping the weights small and thus the model simpler. Additionally, the learning rate schedule mentioned in the context, where the learning rate is decreased when the validation loss remains constant for several epochs, could also be considered a form of implicit regularization. By gradually reducing the learning rate, the model becomes less likely to overshoot optimal solutions and converges more smoothly, potentially avoiding overfitting.
