The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species.

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

layer. From the probabilities obtained for the 8,836 species (represented in green), only the 22 species involved in our study (represented in yellow) are kept and 
multiplied with the corresponding outputs of the baseline model (represented in red). 

the network is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which 
is often the case in ecology datasets. We conducted preliminary exper-
iments  on  enhancing  deep  learning  with  metadata  using  the  Hainan 
gibbon case study and the network developed by Dufourq et al. (2021). 
Our findings revealed that this architecture, applied to the bird classi-
fication  task,  resulted  in  good  results  and  thus  we  adopted  this 
straightforward approach. The proposed methodology can be adapted to 
other CNN architectures.
