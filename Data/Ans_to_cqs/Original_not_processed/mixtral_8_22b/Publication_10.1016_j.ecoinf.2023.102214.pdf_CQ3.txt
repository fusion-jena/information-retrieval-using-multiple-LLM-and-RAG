Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

Our project had access to 359 sightings of snow leopards at hourly 
intervals, yielding 22,120 annotations (i.e., machine learning-detected 
bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos) (Fig. 1). The number 
of  annotations  dropped  to  12,311,  and  the  number  of  separate  en-
counters  dropped  to  116  when  the  data  was  restricted  to  only  in-
dividuals spotted three or more times (three annotations of a side are a 
minimum criterion for PIE model training).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the project had access to 359 sightings of snow leopards at hourly intervals, yielding 22,120 annotations. These annotations were described as machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos. Therefore, one can infer that bounding box annotation was used as part of the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the text also refers to the use of a computer vision model based on machine learning, which suggests that image classification may have been employed as well.
