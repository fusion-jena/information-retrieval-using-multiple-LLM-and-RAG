Tesla K80 GPU for 5 epochs. To align these unsupervised classiﬁcations
with the ImageNet pretraining weights, we normalized the RGB chan-
nels by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. We then
retrained the network using the hand-annotated data for 40 epochs. For
more details of this approach see Weinstein et al. (2019). Data aug-
mentation of random ﬂips and translations was tested and found to
have little eﬀect on the ﬁnal score.

Collecting a suﬃcient number of training samples will often be a
bottleneck in developing supervised methods in airborne imagery. It is
therefore useful to test the number of local training samples needed to
achieve maximum performance. We performed a sensitivity study by
training models using diﬀerent proportions of training data. We se-
lected 5%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the total hand-annotations to com-
pare to the full dataset for the within-site results for each site. We reran
this experiment ﬁve times to account for the random subsampling of
annotations. In addition, we ran the evaluation plots for the pretraining
model only (i.e. 0% hand-annotated data) to assess whether the addi-
tion of hand-annotated data improved the within-site pretraining.

tection of individual tree crowns. Pretraining data is generated by
overlaying predicted trees from a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm
on to RGB imagery. These RGB images are used to pretrain a deep
learning neural network. The resulting model is retrained based on
RGB hand-annotations.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be assumed that after training the model with the hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, the final model would have been saved or serialized for later use. This could involve saving the model architecture along with its learned parameters into a file format such as.h5 (HDF5), which is commonly used for storing TensorFlow/Keras models. As for platform selection, it depends on where the model needs to be deployed - it could be a cloud service like AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, etc., or even on edge devices if real-time predictions are required. But without specific details regarding deployment, I cannot provide more precise information.
