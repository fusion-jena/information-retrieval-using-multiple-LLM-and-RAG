3. Materials and methods 

This section presents the tools and statistical models used to analyse 
the dependencies in this article. The first tool that was helpful in pre- 
processing  the  data  was  standardization  (Williamson  and  Piattoeva, 
2019). This is a kind of normalization that allows changing the scope of 
individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical 
range. It should be emphasized here that this transformation preserves 
the distance relations between individual data. Thus, suppose one have a 
set of records xj ∈ ℝn, j = 1, …, m where n is the number of features. For 
each element j = 1, …, m, the variables are transformed as follows:

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact metrics used to evaluate its performance. However, common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the model in predicting or classifying outcomes accurately. Without further context, I can only speculate which metrics might have been employed in evaluating the deep learning model discussed in the study.
