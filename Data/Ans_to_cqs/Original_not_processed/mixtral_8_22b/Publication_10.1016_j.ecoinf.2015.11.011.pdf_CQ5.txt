Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

For the 2009 NAIP imagery, we used all four bands (R, G, B and IR)
and per-pixel NDVI, and for historical imagery we used the image
brightness and the six GLCM texture measures. We ﬁrst used multi-
resolution segmentation with a large scale parameter to mask forest
and prairie from each other, and then multi-threshold segmentation
on various bands to classify within those areas (Gärtner et al., 2014).
Using ArcGIS's ‘classify’ tool for raster symbology, we examined

the histogram of values for the band in question for breakpoints
in order to choose thresholds. Different bands were helpful for
segmenting and classifying different images. For 2009 NAIP images,
NDVI as well as mean values of different bands (e.g., green, infra-red),
or overall image brightness were often helpful (and for one site, Bald
Hills, per-pixel texture variables calculated for the red band in addition
to the image bands and NDVI were needed in order to discriminate
between classes); for historical imagery the image brightness value
worked well, in addition to contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity and
second moment (see Supplementary data for example eCognition rule
sets).

2.3. Pre-processing of imagery

For the 2009 NAIP imagery, we calculated a per-pixel Normalized Differ-
ence Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer using ArcGIS's Raster Calculator to
use in segmentation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of two types of imagery: 2009 NAIP imagery and historical imagery. These datasets likely include remote sensing data containing multiple spectral bands (Red, Green, Blue, Infrared) and additional layers like per-pixel NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GLCM texture measures (contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity, second moment). The pre-processing involved calculating a per-pixel NDVI layer using ArcGIS's Raster Calculator.
