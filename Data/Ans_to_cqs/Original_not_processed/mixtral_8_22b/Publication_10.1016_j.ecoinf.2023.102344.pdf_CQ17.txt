Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output 
section. For all image-based pre-trained networks, the purpose of CNN

highly  improves  the  performance  of  Hybrid  Deep  Neural  Network 
models, with the zig-zag puzzle nature of the connections resulting in a 
large and diverse number of applications in the field of image analysis 
(Jena et al., 2021).

Approach 2. This is done to avoid bias in comparing their metrics af-
terwards.  All  pre-trained  models  under  Approach  2  converged  the 
training after 1000 epochs with SGDM as the optimization algorithm. 
Adaptive  Moment  Estimation  (ADAM)  was  preliminarily  used  but 
appeared  to  converge  on  a  sharp  minimum  resulting  in  a  negligible 
accuracy, and so, not further considered in this study.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) was initially used as an optimization algorithm but resulted in convergence on a sharp minimum leading to negligible accuracy. This suggests that ADAM might have caused overfitting, and alternative methods were sought. The use of dropout or L2 regularization techniques is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.

Unhelpful Answer:
The text discusses various aspects of deep learning architectures such as ResNet50, InceptionV3, global average pooling (GAP), and skip connections. It also mentions the use of spectral, texture, and geometric features selection using PCA-NCA and sequence layers of GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM in BivalveNet. However, there is no direct mention of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
