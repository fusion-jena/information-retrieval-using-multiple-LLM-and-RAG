3.3. Comparison of data-driven approaches for analyzing aquatic 
ecosystem health 

This study applied conventional machine learning models, including 
ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost, to estimate aquatic ecosystem health. The 
training results of the ANN model showed NSE values of 0.664, 0.651, 
and 0.679 for TDI, BMI, and FAI, respectively (Fig. S1a-c). The RMSE of 
the  ANN  training  were  15.841,  11.787,  and  13.596  for  the  indices

learning rate was initially set to 0.001; however, this value was auto-
matically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best 
performance of the CNN model. The early stopping option stopped the 
model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy 
could not be improved.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting an initial learning rate and then automatically adjusting it to find the optimal point for the best performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Additionally, the early stopping option is used to halt the model training when the validation accuracy cannot be further improved. This approach ensures that the model does not overfit or underfit the data by continuously monitoring its performance throughout the training process.
