means that the model remembered the training data too well and was 
not able to adapt well to the validation data. Dropout is used to help the 
model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and 
improve its generalizability.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the authors deployed their trained models based solely on this excerpt from the paper.
