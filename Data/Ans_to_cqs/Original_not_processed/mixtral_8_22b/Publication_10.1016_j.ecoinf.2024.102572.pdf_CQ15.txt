3.1.3. Fire severity, combustion efficiency

• To enhance the “ForestFireArea” image collection with AGB data, it’s 
important  to  recognize  that  the  global  forest  biomass  dataset 
employed  in  this  study  features  a  resolution  of  100  m.  Initially, 
obtain the MODIS projection details using the “ee.projection()” API 
on  GEE.  Then,  implement  the  “ee.reduceResolution()”  function, 
configuring its “reducer” option to “ee.Reducer.mean()” to average 
the values. Ultimately, this process rescales the image resolution to 
500  m,  resulting  in  the  updated  “ForestFireAreawithAGB”  image 
collection.

resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. However, it mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classification tasks related to forest fires. These techniques could potentially involve various optimization methods depending on the chosen model architecture and training strategy. For instance, neural networks often employ gradient descent algorithms like SGD or Adam during backpropagation to minimize loss and update weights iteratively. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided text, we cannot definitively state which optimization techniques are utilized in this case.
