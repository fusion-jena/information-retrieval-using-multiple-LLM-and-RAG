The  selected  network  models  were  initialized  with  pre-
trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to our datasets. 
The performance of a deep neural network for a dataset highly 
depends on network hyperparameters. The selection and fine-
tuning of  optimized hyperparameters  is  generally  a  difficult 
and  time-consuming  task.  Instead  of  manually  selecting  the 
hyperparameters, we employed Bayesian optimization to find 
their optimal values for each of the six models.  A Gaussian 
process  model  of  the  objective  function  is  used  by  the 
Bayesian optimization technique.  Different variables can be 
optimized using this technique such as network section depth, 
batch size, initial learning rate, momentum, and regularization 
strength. For this study, we optimized the network for batch 
size  (between  1  and  32)  and  initial  learning  rate  (between 
1×10-4  and  1×10-2).  The  optimization  was  performed  by

images  which  do  not  belong  to  a  known  class  (specie)  of  a 
plant. 

The highest testing accuracy was found to be around  96.7% 
using  the  InceptionResNetV2  network.  An  example  of  an 
estimated objective function value for different learning rates 
and batch sizes for this model is shown in Fig. 6 with the best 
batch size of 6 and the learning rate of 0.0014593. On the other 
hand, for VP_200, the maximum testing accuracy was found 
to be 91.8% using Xception net with the second closest one as 
of 91.2% using InceptionResNetV2. Though this dataset was 
more  balanced  and  had  a  large  number  of  samples,  the 
validation  and  testing  accuracies  were  comparatively  lower 
than  the  UBD_45  dataset.  One  potential  reason  may  be  the 
presence of a large number of classes and the nature of images 
in the dataset.

of 87.8% and 91.2% respectively. A comparative evaluation 
of deep learning models was performed by [20] to identify 109 
plant  species  from  the  28,046  images  collected  online.  The 
results  showed  that  MobileNetV2  emerged  as  the  best 
performing  model  with  an  accuracy  of  83.9%  compared  to 
other models. Unlike the approach of [17],[18],[19], and [20], 
Krause  et  al.  [21]  proposed  a  two-stage  approach  for 
identifying  plant  species  from  the  natural  environment.  In 
their  proposed  method,  the  authors  used  a  deep  learning 
semantic segmentation model to segment the plant from the 
images and then used a multiscale crop of the segmented plant 
to train an Inception-ResNet-V2 model. Using the dataset of 
100  species  with  4,500  training  images,  the  proposed 
approach improved the performance of the model by 5.4% to 
achieve  an  accuracy  of  89.21%.  To  study  the  taxonomic

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is for image classification tasks. These models are trained and fine-tuned to recognize and categorize various plant species based on their visual features. Specifically, they aim to distinguish between different types of plants and assign them to their respective classes or categories. This is evident from the use of terms like 'class','species', and 'taxonomic' throughout the text, which all pertain to the identification and organization of organisms into distinct groups. Furthermore, the performance metrics presented in Tables I and II, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, are commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models.
