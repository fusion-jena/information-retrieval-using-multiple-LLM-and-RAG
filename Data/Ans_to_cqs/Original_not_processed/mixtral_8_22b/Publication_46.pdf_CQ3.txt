Convolution is used for feature extraction, in which a kernel is applied to an input
tensor. A feature map is thus obtained through the product of kernel elements and tensor
input. The procedure is then repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. The hyperparameters involved in convolution
operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to
5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.

A pooling layer offers downsampling functionality that decreases the dimensionality
of the feature maps to achieve translation invariance to the alterations and the biases
incorporated and thus helps in reducing the number of learnable parameters. There are
two types of pooling operations, namely Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling [64].
The ﬁrst one extracts speckles from the input feature maps and offers maximum values
in each of the speckles and leaves the remaining values unattended. The second one
downsamples a feature map with a size equaling product of height and width into an array
of a one cross one by averaging the elements of each feature map by retaining the depth of
the feature map. The advantage of Global Average Pooling lies in reducing the number of
learnable parameters along with offering the CNN with variable sized input.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning-based model for
processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern [60]. The model is developed
in such a way that the algorithm learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features by
itself from the lower to the higher levels of the pattern. Mathematically, it is composed of
three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature
extraction is conducted using the ﬁrst two layers and mapping the extracted features to the
output is conducted by the third layer.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data annotation techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide some general insights regarding common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data so that machine learning algorithms can use it to train models. In computer vision tasks, commonly used data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location. It is widely used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides pixel-level accuracy by outlining the exact shape of individual objects within an image. This technique is useful when precise object boundaries are required, such as in medical imaging applications.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation also labels every pixel in an image but groups them based on their category rather than individual instances. For example, all pixels belonging to cars would be labeled as 'car', regardless of whether they belong to separate car instances.

4. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this method involves marking specific points on objects within images. These landmarks help define the structure of objects and are often used in facial recognition systems.

5. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves creating polygonal shapes around objects within images. It is particularly useful for irregularly shaped objects or those with complex structures.
