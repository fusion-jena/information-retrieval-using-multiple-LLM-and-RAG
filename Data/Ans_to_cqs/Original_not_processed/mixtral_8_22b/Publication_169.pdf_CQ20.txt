Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

method,  the  input  size  of  the  LSTM  layer

In  this  work,  a  combined  architecture  is 
proposed  where  by  the  CNN  layer  is 
embedded with the long short-term (LSTM) 
memory  layer  to  pass  those  significant 
features extracted in the initial layers to the 
deeper layers of the network. This supports 
effective  aggregation  of  feature  maps  for 
precise classification and ultimately accurate 
recognition.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the specific type of hardware resource used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs, is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some general hardware requirements from the provided context.

According to the experimental setup section, the CNN-LSTM model was implemented using Python libraries like Theano and Keras. These libraries often utilize GPU acceleration when available, which suggests that a GPU might have been used during the training process. Furthermore, the system specifications listed in Table 1 mention an Intel Core i7 CPU and 16 GB RAM, but do not provide explicit information about the use of GPUs or TPUs.

Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, considering common practices in deep learning and the use of GPU-accelerated libraries, there is a possibility that a GPU was employed for training the model.
