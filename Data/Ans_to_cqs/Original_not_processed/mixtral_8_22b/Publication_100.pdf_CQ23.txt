particular when trained on large data sets.

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained 𝑀 = 5 models with batch size 𝐵 = 64 and a base learning
rate 𝛼 = 10−4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10−3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Eq. (1). We
chose 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999 and 𝜖 = 10−8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ∼14 days.

are in lime, ReLU activations in yellow and grouped convolutions in purple, with an additional argument for the number of groups. ⊕ and ⊙ denote element-wise addition,
respectively concatenation along channel dimension, branching arrows indicate sharing (‘‘copying’’) of the respective tensor. In our experiments we set 𝑵 blocks = [2, 3, 5, 3] and
𝑵 channels = [256, 512, 1024, 2048].

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the authors took some steps towards ensuring the robustness and reliability of their model.

Firstly, they mention training multiple models (M=5), which could potentially help improve the overall performance and reduce overfitting. Secondly, they use a relatively large batch size (B=64) during training, which might contribute to better convergence and more stable gradients. Lastly, they implement early stopping based on validation loss improvement, reducing the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 if no progress is made after 15 epochs. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model doesn't continue training unnecessarily once its performance plateaus.

While these practices do not directly address the issue of generalizability through diverse datasets or specialized evaluation methods, they still demonstrate efforts to create a well-performing and reliable deep learning model.
