encoding and decoding blocks and are summarized in Table 1. These experiments were monitored
using TensorBoard and validated on the validation portion of the dataset.

In general, the limitations of deep learning in comparison to other machine learning methods
are the requirement of large and high-quality training data, as well as hardware limitations related to
GPU computing power. The most notable advantage of deep learning is the grade of automatization
and a high potential to generalize when using large amounts of representative training data, which
might, however, not always be available; especially with respect to ground-truth labels that might be
scarce or not exist at all.. Furthermore, the black-box nature makes these algorithms a good choice for
classiﬁcation as suggested in this study, but a challenge for modeling physical properties, as is often
the case in forestry. This case study relied on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution
obtained from an aerial survey. The great advantage of these data is that many details can be detected.

Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution as it had the best values for IoU and accuracy
while training on fewer epochs. The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 4 and described in
the following.

2.5.1. Encoding Path

As stated in the Introduction, there exist many different CNNs for different applications, and it is
important to ﬁnd the appropriate solution for a speciﬁc task. Retraining existing powerful architectures
such as VGG19 [27], ResNet, or Inception Net to solve other problems by transfer learning is one
approach that is often used. However, this was not an option in our four-band setting and very
particular segmentation task with features that might differ signiﬁcantly from features learned by
networks trained on common image datasets such as ImageNet. Thus, we opted to implement a U-Net
architecture, which is a particular implementation of a CNN ﬁrst developed by Ronneberger [19] for
biomedical image segmentation. One major advantage of CNNs is the ability to extract spatial features
and to detect patterns independently of their position on the input image. The U-Net architecture is

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it mentions that TensorBoard was used to monitor the experiments, suggesting that TensorFlow could have been utilized since TensorBoard is a tool integrated into TensorFlow for visualizing metrics during training. Nonetheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively confirmed if TensorFlow was indeed the chosen framework.
