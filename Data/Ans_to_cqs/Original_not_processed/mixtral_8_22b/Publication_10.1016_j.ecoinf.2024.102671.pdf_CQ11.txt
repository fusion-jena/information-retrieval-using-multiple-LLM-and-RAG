stability within each ecological carbon sink risk zone.

harmonizing  the  enhancement  of  carbon  sinks  with  ecological  risk 
reduction to ensure the prolonged stability of carbon sink ecosystems. 
On the one hand, optimizing carbon sinks is pivotal not only for climate 
change mitigation but also as a foundation for biodiversity protection 
and the sustenance of ecosystem services (Adelisardou et al., 2021; Piao 
et al., 2019). Regions with significant carbon stocks often coincide with 
biodiversity hotspots, making their protection vital for ecosystem health
