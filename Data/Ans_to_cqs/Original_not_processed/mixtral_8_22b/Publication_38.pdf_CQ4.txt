the calls precisely, we converted the probabilistic predictions into individual detections using a
non-maximum suppression to return the local maximum for each peak in the output predic-
tion (Fig 1E). These local maxima corresponded to the predicted locations of the start of each
search-phase bat echolocation call, with associated probabilities, and were exported as text
files.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, it appears that there is no direct mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, one reference does discuss the use of deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation for environmental sound classification [35]. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available and improve the performance of models. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to input data. In the case of audio data, such as that used in environmental sound classification, possible data augmentation techniques could include changing pitch or speed, adding background noise, or applying filters to alter frequency content. Without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline being used, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques employed.
