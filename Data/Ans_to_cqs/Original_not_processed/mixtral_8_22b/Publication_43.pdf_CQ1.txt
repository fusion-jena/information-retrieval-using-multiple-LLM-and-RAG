Deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, are generally trained based on the prediction loss
minimization. Let x and y be the input images and corresponding output class labels, the objective of
the training is to iteratively minimize the average loss deﬁned as

J(w) =

N

N
∑
i=1

L( f (w; xi), yi) + λR(w)

This loss function measures how different is the output of the ﬁnal layer from the ground truth.
N is the number of data instances (mini-batch) in every iteration, L is the loss function, f is the
predicted output of the network depending on the current weights w, and R is the weight decay with
the Lagrange multiplier λ. It is worth mentioning that in the case of GoogLeNet, the losses of the

two auxiliary classiﬁers are weighted by 0.3 and added to the total loss of each training iteration.
The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights.

wt+1 = µwt − α∆J(wt)

The existing works that use deep CNNs in remotely-sensed images can be divided into two broad
groups. The ﬁrst group focuses on the classiﬁcation of high-resolution multi-band imagery (more than
three spectral bands) using CNNs-based methods ([20,21,24,25]). Most of these works reported good
accuracies on well known annotated hyper-spectral scenes (e.g., the Pavia University image and the
Indian pines image [26]).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some sources of data that could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline. For instance, references to high-resolution multi-band imagery suggest that satellite or airborne sensors might be used to collect this type of data. Additionally, there are references to well-known annotated hyperspectral scenes like the Pavia University image and the Indian pines image, which implies that publicly available datasets may also serve as sources of raw data. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
