Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In  the  development  stage,  the  preprocessed  data  was  divided  into 
training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training 
and testing purposes (Shah et al., 2018), followed by the construction of 
predictive  models  using  both  deep  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  Deep 
Neural  Networks)  and  traditional  machine  learning  approaches  (e.g., 
AdaBoost  Regressor,  Support  Vector  Regressor,  etc.),  with  hyper-
parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv 
= 10).  While some studies  might  use different proportions, such as  a 
70–30 split between training and testing/validation (Khan et al., 2022), 
the  80–10-10  split  employed  in  this  study  ensured  a  more  extensive 
training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model. The test 
set,  which  the  model  has  not  previously  seen  during  the  training  or 
validation phases indicates the model’s performance in real-world sce-
narios (Shah et al., 2018).

2.3.3. Transformation 

Two fundamental techniques employed in the data transformation 
process  are  the  MinMaxScaler  and  the  LabelEncoder.  The  former  is 
especially  crucial  for  algorithms  that  are  sensitive  to  the  scale  of  the 
data, such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and neural networks. The 
LabelEncoder was applied to transform categorical fields into numerical 
values. Agricultural datasets often include categorical data, such as soil 
types  or  crop  varieties,  which  must  be  encoded  to  numerical  labels 
before being fed into machine learning algorithms. 

2.3.4. Feature selection

Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

Helpful Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These may include data cleaning, where missing values are handled, outliers are removed, and inconsistent data is corrected. Normalization and scaling are also common preprocessing steps, especially when dealing with features of varying scales. In this case, the MinMaxScaler technique was used, which is particularly important for algorithms like Support Vector Regressors (SVR) and neural networks that are sensitive to the scale of the data. Another preprocessing step mentioned is the transformation of categorical fields into numerical values using the LabelEncoder. This is necessary because agricultural datasets often contain categorical data, such as soil types or crop varieties, which need to be converted into numerical labels before they can be inputted into machine learning algorithms.
