data  can  be  implemented  using  the  encoded  information  of  the 
autoencoder, which concentrates the latent information of the original 
data  (Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Zabalza  et  al.,  2016).  Convolutional  neural 
networks (CNN) are deep learning architectures that have demonstrated 
outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data (Chaddad 
et al., 2021; Gupta and Bag, 2022; Ren et al., 2017). The CNN model has 
been successfully applied to the estimation of variables in aquatic en-
vironments,  such  as  water  quality  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022),  streamflow 
(Hussain  et  al.,  2020),  and  algae  (Cao  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  deep 
learning algorithms are suitable applications for sustainably estimating 
aquatic ecosystem health. Only one previous study applied a CNN-based 
approach, not to classify health levels but to augment aquatic ecosystem 
health data (Lee et al., 2021). Consequently, the deep learning fusion

This  study  adopted  an  autoencoder,  which  is  an  unsupervised 
learning algorithm. It consists of an encoder and a decoder network that 
work together to learn an efficient representation of input data (Badri-
narayanan  et  al.,  2017).  During  training,  the  encoder  compresses  the 
input  data  into  a  lower-dimensional  latent  space,  while  the  decoder 
reconstructs the original input data from this compressed representation 
(Ng, 2011). In particular, effective dimensionality reduction was ach-
ieved using an encoder (Wang et al., 2016). The manifold nodes of the 
encoding layer represent the nonlinear features of the input data (Charte 
et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2015b). Specifically, the encoding layer is utilized 
for  further  application  to  the  input  of  sequential  machine  learning 
models (Ahmadlou et al., 2021; Ju et al., 2015; Shahi et al., 2022). Based 
on the latent information in the encoding layer, the decoder regenerates

2.4.2. Convolutional neural network 

CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image 
recognition and processing tasks (Chauhan et al., 2018). It’s composed 
of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that apply kernels to 
extract  features  from  input  images,  followed  by  pooling  layers  that 
reduce  the  spatial  dimensions  of  the  features.  CNNs  are  designed  to 
automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making them 
highly effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and 
even natural language processing (Khan et al., 2020). That is, the CNN 
architecture  was  designed  to  efficiently  process  complex  datasets 
(Alshehhi et al., 2017). Convolutional layers adopt internal kernel op-
erations that calculate nonlinear features using trainable weights and

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions that only one previous study applied a CNN-based approach to augment aquatic ecosystem health data (Lee et al., 2021). Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of available training data and improve the generalization capabilities of models. These techniques include geometric transformations like flipping, rotating, and scaling, as well as color space transformations and random erasing. While the context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are often employed when working with image data, especially in conjunction with CNNs.
