passes over the entire training set) and a batch size of 64, with an ADAM 
(cid:0) 5. Image augmentation was applied 
optimiser and a learning rate of 10
in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter clock wise shear and a 
random zoom between 0 and 0.2 - all leading to 224 × 244 pixel RGB 
input tensors. Data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, and the 
pixels values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. Model training took 
roughly 4 days. The best model was selected based on minimal valida-
tion loss that occurred at epoch 448. This model showed a training loss 
of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298 and 
validation accuracy of 0.891. We evaluated the red kite model perfor-
mance based on an independent test set of 2060 images (as described in 
3.3). 950 of these images were true positive red kites images and the

only  the  newly  added  layers  were  trained.  ResNet50s  are  commonly 
used in practice, especially for transfer-learning applications, since they 
offer a good trade-off between inference time and accuracy. Similarly,

respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the training process took roughly four days but does not specify whether it utilized GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources.
