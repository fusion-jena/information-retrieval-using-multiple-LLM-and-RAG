Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some common methods used to achieve this include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

A diverse dataset is essential to train a robust deep learning model that can perform well across different scenarios. It should ideally contain images with varying characteristics, such as lighting conditions, object sizes, angles, and backgrounds. Using a diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Cross-validation is another technique employed to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, one subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, while the remaining k−1 subsamples are used as training data. The process is then repeated k times, each time with a different subsample serving as the validation set. Cross-validation provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and test sets based on class labels. This ensures that both sets have roughly the same proportion of examples from each class. Stratification prevents imbalanced classes from skewing the results and allows the model to learn patterns present in all classes equally.

While the given context does not explicitly mention any of these techniques, they are commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models.
