MEE-GP  emerges  as  the  top  performer  for  forecasting  one  month 
ahead; however, on average, MEE-GP-ANN demonstrates higher accu-
racy with an average NSE of 0.5 across all scenarios compared to 0.44 for 
MEE-GP. Table 4 highlights a significant characteristic of MEE-GP-ANN, 
which  is  its  lower  standard  deviation  of  0.09,  indicating  greater  reli-
ability compared to benchmarks DW-GP-ANN and DWE-GP-ANN, which 
have standard deviations of 0.13. Furthermore, MEE-GP-ANN exhibits 
the best performance in terms of variation range, with the lowest ac-
curacy of 0.36 and the highest accuracy of 0.67 (Table 4). In contrast, 
other methods have recorded negative NSE values in their results. Pre-
vious studies have suggested that DW-ANN performs better than ANN 
alone (Dalkiliç and Hashimi, 2020; Santos et al., 2023). However, in this 
investigation  we  presented  MEE  that  outperforms  DW.  Furthermore,

Helpful Answer:
The statistical performance results of the forecasting models mentioned in the given context include Mean Error Ensemble (MEE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Standard Deviation (St.dev). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.

Mean Error Ensemble (MEE): It measures the average error between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE): This metric compares the predictive power of the model against a naïve model that always predicts the mean value of the observed data. An NSE value close to 1 indicates good performance, while a value below zero suggests that the model performs worse than the naïve model.

Standard Deviation (St.dev): It measures the dispersion or spread of the errors around the mean error. Lower values suggest more consistent predictions.

These metrics help assess the overall performance, accuracy, and consistency of the deep learning models.
