to construct soil salinity maps, semantic segmentation—the process of 
assigning a category label to each pixel of an image—is applied to the 
image via the MU-NET deep learning method.

2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors utilize two main sources of raw data collection for their deep learning pipeline: in-situ Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements and remote sensing data.

For in-situ EC measurements, they employ a Veris 3100 Soil EC mapping system, which uses electromagnetic induction technology to measure soil conductivity. This device collects real-time EC readings while being towed across the field by a tractor or other vehicle. These measurements provide valuable information about soil salinity levels, which can be used to create detailed maps of affected areas.

On the other hand, remote sensing data is obtained from satellite imagery. Specifically, the researchers use multispectral images captured by the WorldView-2 satellite. Multispectral images contain multiple bands of light, including visible and near-infrared wavelengths, which can reveal important characteristics of the land surface such as vegetation health and moisture content. By analyzing these images alongside the in-situ EC measurements, the team can develop more accurate models of soil salinity distribution.

Overall, both in-situ EC measurements and remote sensing data play crucial roles in providing comprehensive input data for the deep learning pipeline. While the former offers direct observations of soil properties, the latter provides broader spatial coverage and additional contextual information that enhances model performance.
