3. Experiments and results 

This section details the comprehensive investigation into blue whale 
vocalizations in the Antarctic region. The experimental parameters and 
different crucial steps, and performance evaluation metrics are detailed 
in the section. Additionally, the performance of the proposed WT-HMM 
with varying dataset sizes is presented, showcasing its robustness and 
scalability  across  different  temporal  subsets. The  section extends  to  a 
comparative study involving the WT-HMM and existing feature extrac-
tion  methods such  as PCA,  DMD, and MFCC  adopted with the HMM. 
Finally, the WT-HMM is compared with other machine learning models, 
including  Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN),  Support  Vector  Machine 
(SVM),  and  Spectrogram  Correlation  Detector  (SCD),  over  different 
epochs.

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the experiments were conducted and the performance of the proposed WT-HMM method was evaluated under various conditions. However, it does not specify any details regarding the deployment platform or environment. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
