Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-
niques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating 
notable success in identifying minor fires. Machine learning techniques 
were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable 
success in identifying minor fires. Researchers can utilize the platform’s 
advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. depending on the nature of the problem being solved. In this case, since the context mentions using machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, one could infer that classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score might have been used. But without explicit information, we cannot be certain which metric was used.
