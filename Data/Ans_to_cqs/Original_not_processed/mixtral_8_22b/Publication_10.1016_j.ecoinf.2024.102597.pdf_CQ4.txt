Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

The EL algorithms demonstrate superior performance and high ac-
curacy, but its drawback lies in the inability to uncover the relationships 
between input features and output results, thus lacking interpretability 
for the prediction outcomes, such models are often referred to as black- 
box models. With the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence 
(XAI),  methods  like  Local  Interpretable  Model-Agnostic  Explanations 
(LIME) and SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) have been applied to 
explain  black-box  models  (Lundberg  and  Lee,  2017;  Ribeiro  et  al., 
2016). LIME focuses on providing local explanations, that is, it attempts 
to  explain  the  modelâ€™s  behaviour  around  a  specific  input  data  point, 
whereas SHAP does not have this limitation. SHAP, originating from the 
concept of cooperative game theory, is employed to ascertain the con-
tributions of each collaborator to a cooperative task. It offers the capa-

the corrected data and the true values was smaller than that of the un-
corrected data, confirming the accuracy of our input data.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various 
fields  due  to  its  powerful  ability  to  handle  non-linear  relationships 
(Mohammadi et al., 2023), according to previous surveys, an increasing 
number of studies are attempting to use ML methods to estimate WQP. Li 
et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate 
Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data 
from 2017 to 2019; the results indicated that this model is suitable for 
lakes  with  medium  to  low  Chla  concentrations  (Li  et  al.,  2021). 
Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean 
Color  Network  (OGN)  to  estimate  Chla  concentrations  in  the  Barents 
Sea,  in  comparison  to  Gaussian  Process  Regression,  this  network 
demonstrated  a  5.2%  reduction  in  mean  absolute  error  (Asim  et  al., 
2021). Ensemble learning (EL) is one of the key technologies in the field

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization capabilities of the model.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
The researchers did not apply any data augmentation techniques in their deep learning pipeline because they had a limited number of samples which was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, they focused on using other machine learning algorithms instead.
