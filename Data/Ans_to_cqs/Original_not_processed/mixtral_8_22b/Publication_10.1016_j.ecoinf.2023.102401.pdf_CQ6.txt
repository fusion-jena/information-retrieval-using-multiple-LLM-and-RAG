assigns different weights to each prefusion layer to facilitate adaptive 
feature  fusion.  In  Fig.  6,  we  present  a  novel  feature  fusion  network 
named  the  CRFPN,  which  combines  the  attention  mechanism  with 
feature  fusion.  After  extracting  features  using  the  backbone  network, 
three  output  layers  are  obtained  through  multiple  upsampling  and 
downsampling operations. However, due to the depth of the network, 
some information may be lost, leading to potential negative impacts. To 
address these issues, we propose incorporating a feature layer derived 
from the backbone network, processed by the attention module, as the 
output  layer  for  feature  fusion.  This  approach  not  only  enhances  se-
mantic  information  by  aggregating  additional  characteristics  but  also 
mitigates  the  loss  of  original  information  caused  by  the  increasing 
network depth.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

specific steps are outlined: 

Step 1: Select appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for 
data collection. Pre-processing of the acquired data, such as denoising, 
image enhancement, and correction. In order to train and evaluate un-
derwater target detection models, the dataset needs to be labeled. Then 
separate underwater images collected from the underwater environment 
into training and test images. 

Step 2: Prepare hardware servers capable of training deep learning 
models to deploy the YWnet network. This allows learning weights to 
recognize  underwater  organisms.  Tune  the  hyperparameters  of  the 
model such as learning rate, batch size and network depth to achieve the 
best performance of the model.

The convolutional layer, batch normalization (BN) layer, and SiLU 
activation function are combined to form the CBS block. The SPPF (Li 
et  al.,  2021)  block  operates  three  maximum  pooling  layers,  and  then 
each branch is aggregated to the concat layer. It is capable of combining 
information  from  several  scales.  The  CRFPN  is  utilized  in  the  neck 
portion to combine the extractive features and convey information to the 
head  portion.  Finally,  the  head  predicts  and  presents  the  bounding 
boxes, classes, and concordance scores.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model like YWnet, there are several preprocessing steps involved to prepare the data. These steps include selecting appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for data collection. Once the data is collected, it goes through preprocessing, which involves tasks such as denoising, image enhancement, and correction. Denoising helps remove any unwanted noise or artifacts from the images, while image enhancement improves the overall quality of the images. Correction ensures that the images accurately represent the underwater environment.

After preprocessing, the dataset needs to be labeled to train and evaluate underwater target detection models. Labeling involves identifying and marking objects of interest within the images. For example, if the goal is to detect fish species, each instance of a fish would need to be identified and marked accordingly.

Once the dataset has been labeled, it is separated into training and test images. Training images are used to teach the model how to recognize specific patterns or features, while test images are used to evaluate its performance. During this stage, it is important to ensure that the training and test datasets are representative of the real-world scenarios where the model will be deployed.

In addition to preparing the data, it is also necessary to set up hardware servers capable of training deep learning models. This includes tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network depth to optimize the model's performance. By carefully selecting and configuring these parameters, it is possible to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
