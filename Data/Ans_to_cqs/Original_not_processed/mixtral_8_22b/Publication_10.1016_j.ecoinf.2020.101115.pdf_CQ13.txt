critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It would require more details about the implementation of the machine learning algorithm to provide this information accurately.
