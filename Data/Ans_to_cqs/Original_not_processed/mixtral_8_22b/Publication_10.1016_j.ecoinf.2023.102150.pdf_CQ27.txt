We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

some images from the previous years to the training data set. We then 
retrained the neural network as described before.

2.4. Model retraining 

Based on the quality check, the researcher can decide whether model 

performance  is  satisfactory  or  if  the  model  performance  should  be 
improved by selecting new training images and retraining the model. If 
images from new sites have been classified, model performance can be 
improved by including images from these sites in the training data set. If 
the model had problems with some classes; e.g. identification of some 
species,  it  might  help  to  include  more  images  of  these  species  in  the 
training data set. When selecting new training images, the model output 
from the original model can be helpful to find images that meet a certain 
criteria, e.g. to find images of a certain species. However, all training 
images should be reviewed manually instead of relying on model out-
puts only to avoid misclassified training images.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the specific steps followed for model deployment such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, generally speaking, once a deep learning model has been trained and validated, it needs to be deployed into a production environment where it can receive real-time input and generate predictions. This usually involves saving the model weights and architecture in a format that can be loaded later, known as model serialization. Then, the serialized model can be integrated into a suitable platform or application depending on the use case, which could range from web applications, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.

Since the text does not mention any specifics about the deployment process, we can assume that standard practices were likely followed based on the requirements and constraints of the project.
