NDVI data. Chu et al. (2021a) introduced an adaptive spatial-temporal
tensor completion method (ST Sensor) to fill gaps in the NDVI time se-
ries in cloud- and fog-prone areas. Chen et al. (2021) combined gap-
filling and an SG filter to reconstruct high-quality Landsat NDVI time
series data. These methods focused on algorithmic approaches to fill
missing periods or address weather-related occlusions in NDVI data,
successfully repairing and reconstructing missing data to achieve high-
quality NDVI dense-time-series reconstructions of MODIS and Landsat
data at the spatial scale (Chu et al., 2021b; Yao et al., 2023; Zeng et al.,
2021).

This article presents a new high-quality NDVI image product and a
technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high
spatial resolution. This framework offers a feasible method for recon-
structing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM
technology framework, we successfully produce a Sentinel-2 normalized
NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth
physiological cycles. The key concept of the algorithm is the introduc-
tion of optimal weighted allocation, which calculates and allocates
optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial
and temporal dimensions. By minimizing the sum of squares of the
combined prediction errors within a specific time period, the algorithm
achieves an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel
scale. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial feature
information of two prediction models, providing a robust approach for

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, it focuses on various techniques and studies related to improving Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover analysis. However, I can provide some information about these regularization methods.

Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in deep learning pipelines. It involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less sensitive to individual neuron activations.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reducing the risk of overfitting.

Other popular regularization techniques include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. Each has its own advantages and use cases depending on the specific problem and architecture being employed.
