Deep learning-based denoising methods are most commonly applied 
to  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  such  as  a  human  speech 
enhancement. D´efossez et al. (Defossez et al., 2020) demonstrated the 
potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) performance and be applied in sub-real time on limited hard-
ware. These methods commonly operate on audio spectrograms but in 
recent  years  SOTA  deep  learning  methods  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  have 
successfully  used  raw  waveform  data  (Luo and  Mesgarani,  2019; Luo 
and Mesgarani, 2023) for wider applications such as source separation 
and classification. This removes errors introduced when applying a Fast 
Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  to  generate  a  time-frequency  representation 
and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. These 
networks tend to require more data for training as the latent space must

be  established  (Xie  et  al.,  2021).  Deep  noise  reduction  methods 
(Defossez et al., 2020) often use a U-net architecture which consists of an 
encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent 
space representation. The decoder then uses this latent space to recon-
struct the denoised waveform. Recently, transformer attention mecha-
nisms have also been applied with great success (Cao et al., 2022; Luo 
and  Mesgarani,  2019;  Luo  and  Mesgarani,  2023;  Zhang  et  al.,  2022; 
Zhao et al., 2022). As most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP 
applications, models are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 
22  kHz.  Bioacoustics  applications  commonly  exceed  this  bandwidth. 
Additionally, the sparsity of vocalisations in this application and many 
other  bioacoustics  applications  makes  the  development  of  large-scale 
datasets  infeasible  (Stowell,  2021).  These  factors  limit  the  success  of

For many bioacoustic monitoring applications, noise reduction and 
data  sparsity  are  key  considerations.  This  work  evaluates  various 
traditional and deep learning-based audio enhancement methods with 
sparse data to determine the applicability of common approaches. We 
conclude that traditional methods remain a relevant approach for many 
bioacoustics  applications.  Spectral  subtraction  performs  well  for 
sparsely  spaced  features  and  outperforms  alternative  approaches  in 
terms  of  efficiency  and  data  requirements.  Deep  learning-based  ap-
proaches have seen significant development in recent years. Our results 
demonstrate  that  fine-tuned  audio  enhancement  models  can  achieve 
comparable or better performance compared to traditional approaches 
in  terms  of  noise  reduction.  Audio  enhancement  models  can  also  be 
trained  to  remove  transient  features,  a  key  advantage  compared  to
