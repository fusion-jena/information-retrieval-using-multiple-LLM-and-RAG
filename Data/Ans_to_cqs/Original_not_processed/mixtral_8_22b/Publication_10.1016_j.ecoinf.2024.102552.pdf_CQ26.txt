4.3. Classification scheme choices represent tradeoffs between qualitative 
and quantitative analysis 

Even within our manual classification method, there are options for 
richer analysis. We review our approach to arriving at the existing broad 
classification, but also demonstrate below how a finer classification may 
be possible (and desirable) for individual sites or images.

There may also be ways to include information from online spectral li-
braries  or  other  remote  sensing  products  with  more  detailed  spectral 
information and coarser spatial detail to refine classifications with the 
help of machine learning tools. We do caution, however, that though 
machine  learning  methods  have  great  potential  for  automatic  or  su-
pervised classification, they are still limited by the quality of their inputs 
(both  imagery  and  training  data):  using  NAIP  and  massive  training 
datasets, they can perform well, but they may not succeed for historical 
imagery with its wildly variable characteristics (e.g. blurriness, distor-
tion). More testing is necessary.

Finally, even if uncertainty can be quantified in all stages of analysis, 
which  we  attempted  to  do  (see  Appendix  B),  a  method  needs  to  be 
developed to incorporate all these sources of uncertainty into the final 
result (Comber et al., 2012). In the end, it was only possible to quali-
tatively  connect  our  results  back  to  ground  truthing  data.  This  was 
enough for our purposes but future work may be able to improve on the 
accuracy of the analysis as well as the propagation of uncertainty.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques mentioned in the literature to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes. Both techniques aim to balance the dataset and reduce bias towards any particular class.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and environments to ensure the model learns from a wide range of examples, reducing the risk of biased predictions due to limited exposure to certain types of data.

While these techniques are commonly employed to mitigate data bias, the effectiveness of each technique depends on the specific nature of the dataset and problem being addressed. It is essential to evaluate the impact of these techniques through rigorous experimentation and validation before incorporating them into the deep learning pipeline.
