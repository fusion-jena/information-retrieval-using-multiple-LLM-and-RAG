5.5. Discussion

Recent years have seen increasing concerns about protecting the privacy of conﬁdential
information when processing data using models. This leads to the need for cryptographic
techniques to solve privacy concerns in data-driven models. Several PPDL techniques have
been proposed in the literature to solve these concerns. This research is, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst work that investigates PPDL for satellite image classiﬁcation.

The considered dataset is further divided into three datasets, resulting in 22,666 images
for training the model (training set), 7554 images for validating the trained model (valida-
tion set), and 7554 images for assessing the model performance (testing set).

To obtain this dataset, a semantic segmentation is conducted using our previous
works [51–53]. The four classes—namely, urban, bare soil, vegetation and road—are
extracted from the satellite images, meaning that the resulting images each contain both
the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes.
Then, each image containing a given class is divided into non-overlapping blocks of
256 × 256 pixels and saved into folders, each with the name of the corresponding class. A
sample of this dataset is depicted in Figure 4, wherein the white represents a given land
cover class and the black represents the values of other classes.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements or goals of the analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the model. In the given context, Figures 7 and 8 show the training and validation accuracies of the model over plain and encrypted data respectively.

2. Confusion Matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class.

3. Saliency Maps: Generating saliency maps to understand which parts of the input image were most important for the model's decision making. These maps highlight the regions of the input image that had the highest impact on the final prediction.

4. Visualization of Results: Visualizing the output of the model on test data to gain insights into its performance. For example, plotting predicted vs actual labels, or generating heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution of predictions.

In the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps beyond evaluating the model's accuracy. However, based on standard practices in machine learning, one could infer that they likely calculated additional evaluation metrics and possibly generated some form of visualizations to better understand their model's performance.
