%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only provides details about various deep learning architectures, their performance, and accuracy on a particular task. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
