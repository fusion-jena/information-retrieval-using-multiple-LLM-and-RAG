GA was first proposed by John Holland in the United States in the 
1970s  (Holland  et  al.,  1975).  It  is  an  iterative  adaptive  probabilistic 
search  method  based  on  the natural  selection  principle  and a  natural 
genetic  mechanism  that  simulates  the  development  law  of  biological 
evolution in nature (Deng et al., 2023). The optimization process begins 
with a set of random solutions, also known as a “population.” Each in-
dividual in the population is a solution, and the quality of the individual 
solution  is  determined  by  the  fitness  function’s  evaluation  of  the 
“fitness.” Individuals with high fitness have strong adaptability and high 
survival  probability.  The  parent  generates  the  offspring  population 
through GA operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, and 
the global optimal solution is found through repeated iterations.

P  = 50, the  ESA was  the  best, the  connectivity  rate of  the  ecological 
source  was  84.99%,  the  IIC  value  was  0.81,  the  ecological  source 
coverage  rate was  the highest, and  the fragmentation index  was low. 
Therefore, the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA.

The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

optimization effect and feasibility of the optimization plan. The main 
conclusions are as follows.

Helpful Answer:

According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the genetic optimization algorithm used to identify the optimal Ecological Source Area (ESA) are adjusted using the genetic optimization algorithm itself. This means that the algorithm is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters that will result in the most accurate identification of the optimal ESA.

However, it is not explicitly stated how exactly the hyperparameters are optimized within the genetic optimization algorithm. In general, there are several methods for optimizing hyperparameters, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms. Given that the context mentions the use of genetic optimization algorithms, it can be assumed that some form of evolutionary algorithm is being used to optimize the hyperparameters.

In summary, while the exact method for optimizing the hyperparameters is not specified in the given context, it can be inferred that some form of evolutionary algorithm, possibly a genetic algorithm, is being used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
