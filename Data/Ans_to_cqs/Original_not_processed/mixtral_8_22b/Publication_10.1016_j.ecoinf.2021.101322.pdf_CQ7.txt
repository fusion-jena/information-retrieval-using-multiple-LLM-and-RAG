Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2. Methods 

2.1. CNN training data

Performance of the CNN models were assessed using four different 
metrics (test loss, mean squared error - MSE, mean average percentage 
error – MAPE and accuracy - Acc). Accuracy of the regression tasks was 
calculated  by  rounding  the  prediction  to  the  nearest  integer  age  and 
comparing it with the ground truth. The labelling provided by human 
readers  are  treated  as  the  ground  truth,  and  accuracy  and  other  per-
formance metrics relates directly to this. 

The CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks 
during training are shown in Table 1. During training we use minibatch 
gradient descent.

dataset

Table 2 
CNN performance metrics. MSE is the mean square error, MAPE is the mean 
average percentage error, and Acc% is the average accuracy. In addition, the 
number of images in the dataset (set size) for each task and the weighting of 
classes are given. The × indicates that the performance metric is not applicable 
to the specific CNN.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't a direct mention of how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets for the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that the data would typically be divided randomly into these subsets. A common approach is to allocate around 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and the remaining 10-15% for testing. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, while also providing separate datasets for tuning hyperparameters (validation set) and evaluating final performance (testing set). It should be noted that the exact percentages may vary depending on factors such as the total amount of available data or specific requirements of the project.
