2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

accuracy in comparison to other supervised learning techniques (Brei-
man, 2001; Archer and Kimes, 2008) and allows quantification of var-
iable importance for each potential predictor. To obtain a high level of 
predicted  accuracy,  the  RF  model,  a  regression  tree  method  uses 

bootstrap aggregation and randomisation of predictors (Rigatti, 2017). 
The  model  works  by  using  the  training  dataset  containing  both  the 
response  and  predictor variables,  associated  distance matrix,  and  dis-
tance  thresholds  (Benito,  2021).  The  distance  threshold  is  simply  a

each record was assigned to a 1 km2 grid cell. Specifically, we spatially 
divided the study area into 1 km × 1 km grids and recorded the presence 
of the selected species in each grid cell. Based on this data, two diversity 
metrics viz., species richness and species abundance were calculated. In 
this  study,  species  richness  refers  to  the  number  of  selected  species 
present within the same grid, and species abundance to the number of 
individuals of all the selected species within the same grid.

executions. The relative importance of each predictor variable on both 
the  response  variables  (i.e.,  richness  and  abundance)  was  calculated 
based on the change in prediction error, relying on the median obtained 
from the 30 repetitions. A higher variable  importance score indicates 
that the variable has a greater influence on the model (Xu et al., 2022). 
In addition, the response curves of the most important predictor vari-
ables were plotted to show how the respective variables are important in 
explaining  the  response  variable,  while keeping  all  other explanatory 
variables at their average values.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Random Forest (RF) models have been used due to their high level of predicted accuracy compared to other supervised learning techniques. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics considered when evaluating the performance of the model. Additionally, the text discusses the calculation of variable importance scores based on the change in prediction error, which could indicate that error rate or similar measures may also be relevant in assessing the model's performance.
