research  on  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Traditional  linear  program-
ming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic 
algorithms  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  algorithms,  and  deep 
learning have achieved great success in both theoretical and practical 
applications. Mohammadi (2023) modeled various drought timescales 
by  combining  artificial  neural  networks  with  firefly  algorithms. 
Emamgholizadeh  et  al.  (2023)  used  enhanced  machine  learning 
methods to predict soil cation exchange capacity in the southern region 
of China. Ghezelbash et al. (2023a) combined the GA and firefly opti-
mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al. 
(2023b) added GA to K-means and SVM to construct GIS-based mineral 
prospecting maps, and the results showed that the SVM model based on

The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

rate of the source area was the highest, and a low fragmentation index 
was obtained when the number of ESAs was 50.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the authors might follow common practices in machine learning where the dataset is typically divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation datasets.

A typical approach could involve splitting the dataset into 60-70% for training, 20-30% for testing, and 10-20% for validation. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while using the remaining portions to evaluate its performance and prevent overfitting.

Since the context does not provide any specific details regarding the criteria used for splitting the data, one cannot definitively state how the authors approached this aspect of their work. It would be best to refer directly to the paper or contact the authors for more precise information.
