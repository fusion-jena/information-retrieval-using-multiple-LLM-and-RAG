Recent advances in deep learning techniques have revolutionized the 
field  of  ecology,  surpassing  the  predictive  performance  of  traditional 
methods and giving rise to innovative prediction systems (Capinha et al., 
2021). Deep learning technology has achieved notable success in various 
applications, including the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic 
right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023), the recognition 
of soybean leaf diseases (Yu et al., 2023), bird vocalization recognition 
(Xie et al., 2023), and the monitoring of biological soil crusts (Herdy 
et  al.,  2024).  These  diverse  research  efforts  demonstrated  the  recent 
advancements and promising results achieved by applying deep learning 
techniques to ecological data.

challenging.  This  difficulty  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  bio-
monitoring systems, unlike water quality analysis studies, require sig-
nificant  time  and  effort  to  collect  data  for  training.  As  a  result,  the 
integration  of  deep  learning  into  biomonitoring  for  water  quality 
pollution detection is an area that has yet to see widespread exploration. 
Nevertheless, despite these challenges, recent developments in various 
fields  of  ecology  have  demonstrated  high  performance  in  time-series 
data  analysis  using  the  LSTM  model,  a  type  of  DRNN  model  (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Dehghani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; O'Donncha 
et  al.,  2022;  Zhang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  study,  we  showed  that  the 
performance of a biomonitoring system using time-series data, such as 
the swimming behavior of C. elegans, can be significantly improved by 
introducing  the  LSTM  model.  It  showed  a  high  detection  accuracy  of
