Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained 𝑀 = 5 models with batch size 𝐵 = 64 and a base learning
rate 𝛼 = 10−4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10−3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter 𝜆 from Eq. (1). We
chose 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999 and 𝜖 = 10−8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ∼14 days.

4.3. Loss function

The loss function, which is optimized during training, measures
the quality of a set of network parameters 𝜽 w.r.t. the training data
 = {(𝒙𝑖, 𝒚𝑖)}𝑁
𝑖=1, under some regularizing prior assumptions. We use a
standard loss function (; 𝜽) whose minimization corresponds to max-
imizing the posterior probability of the parameters given the training
data. As it is commonly done in machine learning (see e.g. Goodfellow
et al., 2016), we assume a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian prior over
the network parameters (corresponding to 
2 regularization) and a
Gaussian likelihood function with mean ̂𝝁𝑖 ∶= ̂𝝁(𝒙𝑖; 𝜽) ∈ R5 and
diagonal covariance matrix with logarithmic elements ̂𝒔𝑖 ∶= ̂𝒔(𝒙𝑖; 𝜽) ∈
R5:

(; 𝜽) = 𝜆 ‖𝜽‖

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Training completion is determined based on the validation loss not improving for a certain number of epochs. In this case, the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This indicates that the model might be stuck in a local minimum or unable to learn further from the training data. However, it does not necessarily imply that training should stop completely. It may still be beneficial to continue training with a lower learning rate to fine-tune the model and potentially achieve better performance.
