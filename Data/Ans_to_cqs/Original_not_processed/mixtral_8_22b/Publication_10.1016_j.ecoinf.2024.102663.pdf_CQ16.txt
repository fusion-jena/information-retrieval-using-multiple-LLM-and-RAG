duration of 3.271 s and a predicted duration of 0.029 s. The performance 
measures exhibited by the system were highly accurate, as indicated by 
a  variance  of  0.999  and  an  R2  score  of  0.999.  The  model  achieved  a 
minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.014. The Decision Tree Re-
gressor demonstrated a notably short training time of 0.065 s and an 
even faster prediction time of 0.003 s. Like the extra trees regressor, the 
decision tree regressor demonstrated exceptional performance in terms 
of variance, R2 score, and MAE, highlighting its resilience and suitability 
for the given job. The Linear Regression model was trained in 0.013 s 
and made predictions in 0.003 s. 

Nevertheless, the performance parameters of this particular model 
exhibited distinct differences compared to the other models. It displayed

Random Forest Regressor exhibits the longest training time. However, 
the potential improvement in performance may warrant the investment 
of additional effort. Performance of Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge 
models is deemed unsatisfactory despite their efficient training times.

The  training  duration  indicates  that  both  models  underwent  50 
complete iterations of processing the full dataset. Table 4 offers valuable 
data  regarding  the  performance  of  these  models  across  a  range  of 
criteria. The precision of YOLOv8, denoting the proportion of accurately 
predicted positive observations out of the total anticipated positives, is 
measured  at  0.991.  This  finding  indicates  that  around  99.1%  of  the 
model's detections were deemed to be accurate. In contrast, mYOLOv8 
scored 0.998, indicating that approximately 99.8% of its detections were 
accurate. This suggests that the changed version exhibited a lower rate 
of false-positive detections than the standard version. Another important 
metric to consider is recall, which calculates the proportion of properly 
predicted  positive  observations  in  relation  to  all  observations  in  the 
actual  class.  The  YOLOv8  model  achieved  a  high  detection  rate  of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided information, it appears that the training process for the models mentioned involves completing a set number of iterations through the entire dataset. Specifically, the text states that both models underwent 50 complete iterations of processing the full dataset during training. Therefore, one criterion used to determine when training is complete could be reaching a predetermined number of epochs or iterations through the dataset.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria such as validation loss plateau being used to determine when training should stop. Validation loss plateau refers to a point where the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each iteration, indicating that further training would not improve the model's performance. Other common criteria include early stopping, which ends training if the validation error does not decrease after a certain number of epochs, and maximum runtime, which limits the amount of time spent on training.

Without more detailed information about the training process, it is difficult to definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. Nonetheless, based on the available context, it can be inferred that one possible criterion is reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations through the dataset.
