gen.de/z2/LSAspaces  (Günther  et  al.,  2015).  This  model  has  been 
demonstrated  to  generate  high-quality  performance  with  dense  word 
vectors  and  to  produce  the  best  results  regarding  semantic  similarity 
tasks (Baroni et al., 2014). This space was created using the CBOW al-
gorithm and contains vectors for 300,000 different words, covering a 
broad variety of different topics. It was trained from a 2.8-billion-word 
corpus, a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus (web pages material from . 
uk  domain;  Baroni  et  al.,  2009),  Wikipedia,  and  the  British  National 
Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007).

Word2vec  is  a  widely  known  word  embedding  technique  (e.g., 
Mikolov et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), and has been a successful tool for 
investigating CES from social media data (e.g., Gugulica and Burghardt, 
2023).  Word2vec  can  be  carried  out  in  two  ways:  by  creating  and 
training your own word2vec space based on two different architectures, 
namely, Skip-gram, which predicts the target word based on a nearby 
word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which learns to predict a 
target word according to its context (Mikolov et al., 2013), or by using 
pre-trained  models (e.g.,  Baroni et al., 2014). Training a new  custom 
word2vec model requires a very large dataset, increases the computa-
tional effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data. 
Therefore,  we  performed  the  semantic  analysis  using  the  pre-trained 
baroni  word2vec  model  provided  at  http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebin

%Query
Query: "What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various techniques and tools related to text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. Given this focus, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in these pipelines is likely textual data, such as those found in documents, webpages, and social media posts. Techniques like BERT, Word2Vec, and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are all designed to process and analyze textual data. While other data formats like images, audio, and video may also be relevant in certain applications, they are not directly discussed within the given context.
