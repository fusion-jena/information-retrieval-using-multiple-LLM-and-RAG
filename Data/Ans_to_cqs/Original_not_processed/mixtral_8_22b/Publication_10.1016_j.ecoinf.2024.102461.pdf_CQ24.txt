of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across all experiments to ensure reproducibility. This means setting the same initial state for the pseudorandom number generator used in the model training process. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization or stochastic processes like dropout. Ensemble methods, which combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds, can also improve performance and robustness. Finally, deterministic algorithms or architectures can be used instead of those involving random components, although this may limit their expressive power or generalization ability.
