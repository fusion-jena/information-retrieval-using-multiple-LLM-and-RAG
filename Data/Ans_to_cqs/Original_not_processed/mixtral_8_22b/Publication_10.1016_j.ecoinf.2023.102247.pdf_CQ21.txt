To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include several methods such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, based on the given context, it appears that the authors have primarily focused on evaluating the model performance through cross-validation and calculating the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the metric for specifying the accuracy of their ensemble model. They used 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the remaining 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. The AUC is a scale ranging from 0.5 to 1.0, where a higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate. Therefore, based on the given context, the primary postprocessing step involved after the model training was the evaluation of the model performance using cross-validation and AUC calculation. Other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
