Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

rogates  (100  surrogates)  and  a  significance  level  of  1%. The  network 
computation considered lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h).

2.2. Data collection and processing

(4) 

A  comprehensive  explanation  of  additional  statistics,  such  as  the 
decomposition of individual MI (Eqs. 5 and 6) as well as individual es-
timates of U, S, and R (Eqs. 7, 8, 9, and 10) involved in the generation of 
process networks is provided in the Supplementary text (1.1 Method). 
TPINet  effectively  works  when  there  are  at  least  200  data  points 
(Goodwell  and  Kumar,  2017a).  This  approach  can reveal  interactions 
occurring on hourly to daily time scales over several-day-time windows. 
Studies  employing  an  information  theory-based  transfer  entropy 
approach for network generation, with datasets at sub-hourly and sub- 
daily scales, have consistently provided robust results (Goodwell et al., 
2018; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017a; Goodwell and Kumar, 2017b).

NEE  considering  a  maximum memory  of 6  h, which  is  lacking in  the 
literature.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the use of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
