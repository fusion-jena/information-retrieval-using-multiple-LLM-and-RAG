et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2020). The spectral vegetation index can be 
used not only for monitoring the biomass of surface vegetation but also 
for monitoring forest pests and diseases on a large scale and classifying 
the  degree  of  damage  to  forest  trees.  The  use  of  hyperspectral  moni-
toring for forest pests and diseases has limitations due to complex data 
processing, high acquisition costs, and impractical requirements (Bing-
tao et al., 2023; Taixia et al., 2016; Xiapeng et al., 2022). The application 
of  multispectral  monitoring  of  forest  pests  has  been  more  extensive; 
multispectral  monitoring  can  not  only  discriminate  features  based  on 
differences in the morphology and structure of images but also be used 
to monitor large areas and expand the information volume of remote 
sensing data. The use of multispectral monitoring of changes in spectral 
vegetation information of forest trees enables the response of vegetation 
indices to pest stresses.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another optimization technique was used.
