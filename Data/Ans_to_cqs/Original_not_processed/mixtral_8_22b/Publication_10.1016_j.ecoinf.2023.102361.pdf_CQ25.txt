Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Split the datasets 

In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts 
for training, validation and testing. Here, 60% of the data was used to 
train the deep learning models, and 20% of them was kept to validate the 
models. The remaining 20% data was used to evaluate the performance 
of the models. Table 1 show the number of data in the dataset and how 
they are separated for training, testing and validation. 

2.3. Deep learning models

VGG16 and VGG19 are classical architectures that are well known 
for  simplicity  and  uniformity.  These  models  are  suitable  for  smaller 
datasets and can provide better accuracy by fine-tuning the pre-trained 
network (Sukegawa et al., 2020). The models have several drawbacks, 
such  as  vanishing  gradient  problems  and  loss  of  fine-grained  spatial 
information (Pan et al., 2020). On the other hand, ResNet-50 contains 
residual  connections,  which  can  overcome  the  vanishing  gradient 
problem and enable training very deep networks. The model performs 
well on both large and small datasets (Al-Masni et al., 2020).

2.7. Experimental setup 

The experiments were conducted using a desktop computer with an 
Intel Core i9-9900Ã— processor, 128 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce 
RTX 2080 Ti graphics card. The deep learning models were developed 
using Python 3.8 and Tensorflow 2.4 library. The models were initialised 
with the pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset. Since the 
models were trained to classify 1000 classes of images, the classification 
layer of the models was replaced for fine-tuning them on the crop-weed

2.3. Deep learning models 

The  selection  of  the  deep  learning  models  for  image  classification 
depends  on  available  computational  resources  and  the  trade-offs  be-
tween the model complexity and performance (Druzhkov and Kustikova, 
2016;  Li  et  al.,  2018).  To  test  the  performance  of  our  technique,  we 
selected  the  following  deep  learning  models:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and 
Zisserman, 2014), VGG19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), ResNet-50 
(He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-V3  (Szegedy  et  al.,  2016),  InceptionRes-
NetV2  (Szegedy et  al., 2017), Xception  (Chollet,  2017), DenseNet121 
(Huang et al., 2017), DenseNet169 (Huang et al., 2017), DenseNet201 
(Huang et al., 2017) and MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018). For the 
sake  of  brevity,  we  briefly  summarise  the  main  attributes  of  these 
techniques.

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is for image classification. This is evident from the statement in section 2.3 where it mentions that the models were selected based on their suitability for image classification tasks. Additionally, in section 2.7, it states that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. Furthermore, the statement about replacing the classification layer of the models for fine-tuning them on the crop-weed dataset also indicates that the models are being used for image classification purposes. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning models in this study is to perform image classification tasks.
