speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

significantly  reduce  model  complexity  while  ensuring  detection 
accuracy.

shortened the inference time on RTX 3060 by 54%. This indicates that 
the algorithm is lightweight, achieves an accuracy comparable to state- 
of-the-art methods, and is more suitable for marine zoobenthos recog-
nition tasks.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the trained model using various performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, etc., visualizing results through techniques like saliency maps or heatmaps, and creating confusion matrices to understand misclassifications better. These steps help assess the model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
