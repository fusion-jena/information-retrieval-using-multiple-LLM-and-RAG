Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

3.1. Model evaluation and selection 

The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong 
influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its 
predictions (Fig. 2). In general, longer model training past 1000 itera-
tions tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

The AUV survey took 22 h from deployment to recovery. The whole 
pipeline of analysis including manual annotation and quality assessment 
of the training set, and training and testing of the model itself could take 
5 to 10 days depending on the density of the target species in the images, 
the  hardware available  and  the  experience  of  the  operator. The  most 
time-consuming tasks are the training sets annotations and the training 
of the CNN. Making predictions on 60,000 images was performed in 10 
h. This means that the presented map of species abundance and relative 
seabed cover could be available in less than a day after the AUV came 
back from its mission provided a working CNN is available prior to the 
launch. In that case, these results would require very little time invest-
ment and be available almost immediately.

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, one of the references mentioned is "Google Colaboratory" (Bisong, 2019), which suggests that the authors might have used Google Cloud Platform for their work. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm this assumption with certainty.
