The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, none of the given sources directly discuss or mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These optimization techniques play a crucial role in training neural networks efficiently and effectively.

In general, optimization techniques like SGD and Adam help minimize the loss function during the training process. They adjust the weights and biases of the network iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function concerning those parameters. This allows the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.

While the mentioned papers cover various aspects of deep learning, including comparisons between different frameworks, applications in neuroscience, and event-based platforms for collaborative threat detection, there is no explicit discussion about optimization techniques within these works. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct reference to any particular source regarding the use of SGD or Adam in the deep learning pipeline.
