Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor. 

3.3. Past projections and present climatic suitability

JimÂ´enez et al., 2022). To further refine our projections, we tested two 
types of cutouts; one is called the general extent (GE), encompassing the 
total sum of the natural distribution areas of the four species, and the 
other is referred to as the specific extent (SE), restricted to the individual 
distribution  of  each  species.  To  crop  the  bioclimatic  layers,  we  used

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the study uses climatic variables such as temperature seasonality (Bio04) and precipitation of driest month (Bio14) as input features for predicting climatic suitability for different species. These variables are likely stored in a structured format like CSV or similar tabular data format. Additionally, the use of QGIS suggests that spatial data might also be involved in the analysis. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, this remains speculative.
