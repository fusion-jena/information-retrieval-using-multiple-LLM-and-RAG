split  data  with  the  highest  mAP50  (0.987)  for  the  prediction  of  our 
model.

Three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using our own data 
(clusters of extracted numbers), as described above, as input for training, 
whereas the other three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained with 
the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) 
dataset of handwritten digits, which can be used to train classification 
models (Deng, 2012).

Using this ideal split, a test was conducted using unprocessed data. 
This indicates that the test dataset appeared to be similar to the training 
data  because  it  consisted  of  images  of  the  extracted  clusters  without 
further processing. 

The  dataset  used  in  this  study  included  single-tree  point  clouds, 
images of single-trees, and *. csv containing the attributes used to pro-
duce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers (in two different 
point-thickness settings), labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the 
numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results 
of  our  digit  recognition  are  freely  available  under:  Doi:  https://doi.

3. Results 

3.1. Classification accuracy

Image preprocessing was conducted using Python with the OpenCV 
library (Python Software Foundation, 2023b). The last step was image 
inversion, in which white pixels (representing markings) were switched 
to black pixels, and the black pixels (representing the background) were 
switched to white pixels. 

The  YOLOv8-framework,  an  end-to-end  neural  network  (Jocher 
et al., 2023), was used for model-building training, and a Python (Py-
thon Software Foundation, 2023a) script was used to convert all labels 
into the required format. These labels were annotated to the original via 
Labelbox (Labelbox, 2023) and consisted of the numbers that each image 
was  supposed  to  show.  A  separate  script  downloaded  all  scatterplot 
images,  including  labels  created  through  Labelbox.  Moreover,  the 
required data structure was automatically created, and images and la-
bels were moved to the corresponding folders for training, testing, and 
validation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the information provided. However, it is common practice to use various data augmentation techniques during the training phase of deep learning models to improve their performance and generalization capabilities.
