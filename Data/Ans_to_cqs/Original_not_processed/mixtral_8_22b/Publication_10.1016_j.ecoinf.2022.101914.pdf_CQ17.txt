2.7. Subsetting background points 

We  made  three  random  selections  of  background  points  from  the 
training dataset for use during model construction. First, we made the 
“1×” selection, which selected the same number of background points as 
presences in the training dataset. Second, we made the “10×” selection, 
which selected a number of background points equal to ten times the 
number of presences in the training dataset. Third, we made the “10 K” 
selection, which selected 10,000 background points from the training 
dataset.  We  used  this  approach  to  maintain  consistency  across  back-
ground  points  used  to  train  each  model  so  there  was  no  variation  in 
model results due to variation in the response variable. 

2.8. Training individual models

to model performance by a single component model built with subop-
timal training data. However, RF outperformed all the ensemble models, 
suggesting  that  if  researchers  use  a  single  modeling  approach,  they 
should consider using RF. It should be noted that we found RF to be more 
sensitive to the number of background points used to train the model 
than  other  modeling  methods.  However,  researchers  or  practitioners 
might choose to use a single modeling approach that is found to be less 
sensitive to the number of background points, like a GLM or MaxEnt. In 
this situation, since the gain in performance is minimal, the decision on 
how many background points to use might be instead made to minimize 
computation time and answer time-sensitive questions related to con-
servation  actions.  Nevertheless,  using  an  ensemble  of  models  helps 
overcome any issues that any single model might have, as demonstrated

points. Then, to obtain presences and background points to use during 
external evaluation, we set aside one fold. We then used the remaining 
four folds for internal cross-validation during model training.

2012). Furthermore, the popular software MaxEnt, a machine learning 
approach, is known to perform well with a large number of background 
points (Barbet-Massin et al., 2012). Although the information is useful, 
the within-group inconsistencies described above can be confusing when 
modelers need to decide the number of background points to use in the 
context of ensemble modeling. It remains unclear how the number of 
background  points  selected to  train  each  component model  might  in-
fluence the overall performance of an ensemble model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two common regularization techniques: dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to small changes in input features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. These techniques help improve generalization and reduce overfitting in deep learning models.
