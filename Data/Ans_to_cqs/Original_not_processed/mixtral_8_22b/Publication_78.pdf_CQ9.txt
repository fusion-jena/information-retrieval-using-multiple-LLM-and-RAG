corals bleaching on aquatic animals life.

Similarly, in [8] hyper-spectral bottom index imagery is used for bottom-type classiﬁca-
tion in coral reef areas. The drawback of this technique is the need for an enormous number
of samples in the dataset for achieving higher accuracy. In [9], they proposed a method
of deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 for corresponding coral classiﬁcation that
needs a massive dataset for better accuracy.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various techniques such as SVM, LBP, HOG, LETRIST, GLCM, CJLBP, LTrP, AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, Inceptionv3, CoralNet BoF, and their performance metrics like sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa. However, it does not provide any details about the availability or location of the data repository. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
