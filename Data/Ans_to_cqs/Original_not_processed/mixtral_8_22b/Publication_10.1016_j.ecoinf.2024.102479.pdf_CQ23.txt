hyperparameters  in  a  model.  It  identifies  the  most  effective  set  of 
hyperparameters  that  enhance  the  model's  performance.  During 
training,  GSCV  generates  a  series  of  models,  each  characterized  by  a 
different  set  of  hyperparameters.  The  purpose  of  this  technique  is  to 
systematically train and assess the performance of these various models 
through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the 
model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by 
its optimal hyperparameter combination (Adnan et al., 2022). Details of 
the primary tuning parameters, their range and the optimal combination 
of  hyperparameters  utilized  for  each  algorithm  for  each  model  are 
shown in Table 1.

To assess the performance of the models, k-fold cross-validation was 
employed,  a  widely  used  evaluation  method  in  machine  learning 
(Anguita et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2022; Yadav and Shukla, 2016). This 
technique has proven to be valuable in machine learning for estimation 
and aids in preventing overfitting by dividing the dataset into k subsets. 
Some of these subsets are used for training the model, while the others 
are utilized to evaluate its performance. In the present study, a 10-fold 
cross-validation  design  was  employed  as  per  Tyralis  et  al.  (2019b). 
The  dataset,  consisting  of  138  ground-based  AGB  estimates  (after 
eliminating outliers), was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset 
was designated for model training while the remaining 30% was used as 
testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a 
sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included 138 ground-based AGB estimates after eliminating outliers. Secondly, k-fold cross-validation was employed as an evaluation method. This technique helps prevent overfitting by dividing the dataset into k subsets. Some of these subsets are used for training the model, while the others are utilized to evaluate its performance. In this study, a 10-fold cross-validation design was employed. Lastly, the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training while the remaining 30% was used as a testing dataset. This approach ensures that the model is trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for testing. These measures help ensure that the deep learning model can perform well not only on the training data but also on unseen data, thereby improving its generalizability.
