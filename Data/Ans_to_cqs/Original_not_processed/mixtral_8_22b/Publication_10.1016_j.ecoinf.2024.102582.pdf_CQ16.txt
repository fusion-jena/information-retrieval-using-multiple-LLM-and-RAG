(4)  The accuracy of the classification was  evaluated. The resulting 
classification  confusion  matrix  showed  that  the  total  accuracy 
ranged from 83.04% to 90.13% (Table 2), and the average Kappa 
coefficient  of  the  landscape  classification  exceeded  0.862. 
Therefore,  the  accuracy  of  the  classification  was  sufficient  to

(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

Helpful Answer:
The table provides information on the user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficients for the landscape classification results for different years. However, it does not provide any specific criteria or metrics used to determine when training is complete during the random forest algorithm application process. Therefore, based solely on this table, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, common criteria include reaching a certain number of iterations, achieving a desired level of performance (such as minimizing validation loss), or observing no significant improvement after several iterations. However, without additional context or information, I can only speculate about the specific criteria used in this case.
