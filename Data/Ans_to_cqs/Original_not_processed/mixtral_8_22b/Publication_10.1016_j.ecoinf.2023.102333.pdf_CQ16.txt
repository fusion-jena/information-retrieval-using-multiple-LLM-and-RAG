or Bayesian optimization approaches and should, therefore, be used if 
sufficient computation resources are available. 

Learning  and  loss  curves  were  also  used  to  diagnose  the  learning 
performance of the three models over time (Fig. 7). The training accu-
racy curve provides insight into how the model is learning, while the 
validation accuracy gives insight into the generalizing process. Likewise, 
the training loss curve shows the model’s performance on the training 
data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to 
minimize  the  loss  function.  The  validation  loss  curve  measures  the 
model’s performance on new unseen data.

The  points  were  randomized  and  divided  into  training  (80%)  and 
validation  (20%)  sets.  A  15  m  buffer  was  applied  around  all  sample 
points  to  ensure  independence  between  the  datasets  (Fig.  4).  The 
reference points were then exported to the cloud for model training and 
validation.

2.7. Accuracy assessment 

The  model  with  the  best  accuracy  was  retained  after  training  the 
three main DNN models for 200 epochs. An overall accuracy measure 
was conducted to evaluate the accuracy level of our final DNN model 
using  our  validation  dataset.  A  confusion  matrix  was  produced  to 
highlight the accuracy of each class. Three quality metrics were added: 
Overall  Accuracy  (OA),  Producer  Accuracy  (PA),  and  User  Accuracy 
(UA). 

Overall accuracy is the ratio of the sum of correctly classified pixels 
to  the  total  number  of  pixels  in  the  test  dataset.  While  the  producer 
accuracy refers to the accuracy from the point of view of the mapmaker, 
the user’s accuracy represents the probability that a pixel classified in 
each  category  corresponds to  the  actual  category  on  the  ground.  The 
performance  of  our  final  DNN  model  was  evaluated  using  the  kappa 
coefficient of agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977):

Helpful Answer:

Training completion is determined by several criteria, including the validation loss plateau. In this case, the three main Deep Neural Network (DNN) models were trained for 200 epochs. Epochs refer to one iteration where the entire dataset is passed both forward and backward through the neural network only once. After training these models, the one with the best accuracy was retained. This suggests that the training was considered complete when the desired level of accuracy was achieved or when no further improvement could be made within the specified number of epochs. Additionally, learning and loss curves were used to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time. These curves provide insights into how well the models are learning and generalizing, which can help determine whether more training is needed or not. Specifically, the validation accuracy and validation loss curves give information about the model's performance on new unseen data, indicating its ability to generalize. Therefore, a combination of factors such as achieving a certain level of accuracy, observing a plateau in validation loss, and evaluating learning and loss curves can be used to determine when training is complete.
