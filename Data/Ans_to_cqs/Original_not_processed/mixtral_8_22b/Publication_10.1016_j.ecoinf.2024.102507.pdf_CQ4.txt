With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

after the above training data preparation is as follows (Fig. 6). One of the 
optimal  simulation  results  (72band_256_16bit_split)  was  achieved 
through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution 
kernels, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

5.  Spatial reference information for each tile 

Each image tile used in this study was provided with its own spatial 
reference  information,  ensuring  accurate  geographic  positioning  and 
alignment during further processing stages.  

6.  Data augmentation and reduction 

Data  augmentation  is  critical  for  enhancing  the  robustness  of  the 

deep  learning  model.  Using  Rasterio,  the  original  image  tiles  were 
augmented through techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. 
Data  reduction  techniques  were  applied  to  eliminate  irrelevant  or 
redundant data, streamlining the dataset for efficient processing.  

7.  Disassembling tiles into single-band images 

Rasterio was employed to disassemble multi-band images into single- 
band images to enhance efficacy. This step ensured that each spectral 
band  was  separately  processed,  optimizing  the  potential  for  feature 
extraction.

Helpful Answer:
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, flipping, and zooming. These techniques were implemented using the Rasterio library to augment the original image tiles. Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of the deep learning model by creating new training examples from existing ones, thereby increasing the diversity of the dataset and reducing overfitting. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, while flipping refers to reflecting the image along one of its axes. Zooming entails scaling the image up or down, effectively changing its size without altering its content. By applying these transformations, the model can learn to recognize objects under various conditions, making it more versatile and reliable.
