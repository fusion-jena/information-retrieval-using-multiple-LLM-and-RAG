Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

hyperparameters for model architectures.  

2.  Partial training: Models are partially trained (on a small fraction of 
the data) to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations.  
3.  Successive Halving: The remaining configurations are grouped into 
sets of different sizes, and the associated models are trained further. 
The best-performing configurations in each set are promoted to the 
next  stage,  while 
the  under-performing  configurations  are 
eliminated. 

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until only one configuration re-
mains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

described in the next section. 

During the training of the model, the data is then standardized. In 
section 4, one of the three datasets will be defined as a training base, on 
which the standardizaion parameters will be calculated and applied to 
the  other  two  datasets  considered  as  test  base.  The  best  result  of  the 
optimisation will allow us to determine the base that will be used for 
training.

For more details on the theory of the elements discussed we refer the 
reader to the reference book (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This architecture 
involves  a  large  number  of  hyperparameters  related  to  the  different 
types of layers (convolutional or recurrent) and therefore a large number 
of  parameters.  As  a  reminder,  a  parameter  is  internal  to  the  neural 
network.  It  will  evolve  during  the  whole  training  process  A  hyper-
parameter is external to the training process, it defines the properties of 
the network. It remains static during the training process. 

The  HyperBand  algorithm  is  proposed  for  optimisation  and  is 

described in the next section.

The key idea behind Hyperband is to explore several configurations 
in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising con-
figurations. This enables a more efficient search of the hyperparameter 
space, particularly when computational resources are limited. In sum-
mary, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a ‘successive 
halving’  strategy  to  quickly  identify  promising  configurations  while 
eliminating those that show inferior performance. 

The  detail  of  the  grid  of  possible  combinations  is  presented.  The 
number of convolution layers is lower than that given in the article, the 
network has two convolution layers. Their size and the associated max- 
pooling will be determined in the following interval for each:

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. One common step mentioned in the provided context is data standardization. Standardizing the data involves transforming it so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This helps to improve the convergence speed of the model by making the input features have similar scales. Additionally, the context mentions that the standardization parameters are calculated based on a training dataset and then applied to the test datasets. Other potential preprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in the provided context could include handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. However, these specific steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the particular deep learning task.
