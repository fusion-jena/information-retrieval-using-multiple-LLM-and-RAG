The  volume  of  multivariate  data  increases  as  more  information  is 
generated in fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecol-
ogy, and text processing. Dealing with multivariate data is a complex 
task that may lead to the curse of dimensionality; i.e., redundant or non- 
significant variables, degradation of model performance, and difficulty 
in visualizing the relationships between features (Anowar et al., 2021). 
To  address  these  problems,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  (DRM) 
provide tools to explore linear and non-linear featured relationships and 
help select and extract these from a multivariate space. Some examples 
of  linear  DRM  are  Principal  Components  Analysis,  Single  Value 
Decomposition,  and  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (Ayesha  et  al., 
2020).  However,  linear  DRM  cannot  address  more  complex  relation-
ships,  and  non-linear  DRM  have  thus  gained  importance  in  research.

To our knowledge, this is the first application of UMAP to directly 
estimate species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic vari-
ables.  Other  studies  have  used  DRM  to  visualize  results  from  deep 
learning models; e.g., Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (another DRM) to 
visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural 
network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. On the 
other hand, we applied clustering to identify groups containing species 
and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity 
between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic re-
gions, i.e., to show that groups in the reduced dimension have similar 
bioclimatic  properties  within  a  group,  but  differ  among  groups  (see 
Figs. 6, 7). This behavior underlines the nature of UMAP in that back-
ground points near species samples share similar bioclimatic properties

In  ecology,  species  distribution  modeling  (SDM)  is  an  important 
research  area,  with  applications  in  conservation  management  of 
threatened species, analysis of invasive pests and climate change, and 
niche  modeling  (Franklin,  2013;  Srivastava  et  al.,  2019).  Different 
methods have been proposed to assess how bioclimatic variables influ-
ence  species  occurrence.  Some  machine  learning  techniques,  such  as 
support  vector  machines,  artificial  neural  networks,  random  forests, 
genetic algorithms, and maximum entropy, have been applied to study 
species distribution (Elith and Leathwick, 2009; Gobeyn et al., 2019). 
The fundamental problem in SDM is finding a subset of environmental 
conditions in certain regions that are similar to those in the locations 
where the individuals are found. This is normally achieved by fitting a 
model using a multivariate set of bioclimatic variables, associated with

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve generalization capabilities. Two popular regularization methods include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to small changes in the inputs. The dropped out neurons do not contribute to both forward pass and backward pass calculations. During testing, all neurons are included, but their outputs are scaled down by the probability of being retained during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, it encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. In practice, L2 Regularization can be implemented by adding a factor multiplied by the sum of squared weights to the cost function.

These regularization methods help control the complexity of the model, allowing it to better generalize to unseen data while avoiding overfitting to the training dataset.
