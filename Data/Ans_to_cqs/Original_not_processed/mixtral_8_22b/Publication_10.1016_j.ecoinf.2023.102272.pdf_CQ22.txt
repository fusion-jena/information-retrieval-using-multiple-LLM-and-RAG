3.2. Deep learning model accuracy, predictive performance, and predictor 
importance 

Concerning the performance of the candidate models, the best vali-
dation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years (accuracy 
= 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd) (Fig. 2), a model having a Deep 
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture. 
Model  19,  also  with  a  DeepConvLSTM  architecture  had  high  vali-
dation accuracies too (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), 
followed  by model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) archi-
tecture reaching a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005 (mean of years 
± sd).

Fig. 2. Validation accuracy for candidate models. For each candidate model (1–20 on the vertical axis), each bar corresponds to one test year (from top to bottom: 
2019 to 2013). The best model in all years is model 12, having a DeepConvLSTM architecture.

Also, deep learning approaches should be compared with the more 
classical  statistical  and  machine  learning  approaches  to  assess  how 
model  performances  differ  between  methods.  In  this  sense,  we  com-

Helpful Answer:

The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is validation accuracy. This metric measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of the total number of instances evaluated. The highest validation accuracy was achieved by Model 12, which has a Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture, with an accuracy of 0.833 ± 0.005 (mean of years ± sd). Other models with high validation accuracies include Model 19, also with a DeepConvLSTM architecture (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), and Model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture (validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd). Additionally, the Area Under Curve (AUC) is reported for different classes in Table 2, providing further insight into the model's performance across various categories. However, other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
