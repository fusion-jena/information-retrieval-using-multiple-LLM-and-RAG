Yin  and  Wang  (2019)  used  traditional  MCWS  and  RG  algorithms  to 
segment  individual  mangrove  trees  based  on  a  LiDAR-derived  CHM. 
When  the  traditional  algorithm  was  applied  to  relatively  dense 
mangrove  plots,  individual-tree  segmentation  results  were  relatively 
poor, with an accuracy of <35%. Deep learning (DL), an emerging data 
mining technology, is widely used in image object detection and seg-
mentation research (Hussain and Badola, 2010). Jin et al. (2018) used 
three-dimensional  (3D)  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to 
segment  individual  plants  in  maize  plots  using  ground-based  LiDAR 
data. DL achieved good results, with R, P, and F values above 0.9 for the 
three experimental sites with different planting densities. Wang et al. 
(2019a) used the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation 
based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. Segmentation

Accordingly, this study used a LiDAR sensor mounted on a UAV to 
collect HD LiDAR data, and generated CHMs with different spatial res-
olutions from the LiDAR data. Based on the CHMs and LiDAR data, four

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The studies mentioned utilize various methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipelines. For instance, some researchers use Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or drones equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to collect High Definition (HD) LiDAR data (Yin & Wang, 2019; Windrim & Bryson, 2020). This method allows for the generation of Canopy Height Models (CHMs) with different spatial resolutions from the LiDAR data (Yin & Wang, 2019). Additionally, other researchers employ satellite remote sensing techniques to gather data, such as multispectral images (Liu & Abd-Elrahman, 2018). Furthermore, some studies leverage publicly available datasets like the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset (Xu et al., 2021). Lastly, ground-based LiDAR data has also been used for data collection purposes (Jin et al., 2018).
