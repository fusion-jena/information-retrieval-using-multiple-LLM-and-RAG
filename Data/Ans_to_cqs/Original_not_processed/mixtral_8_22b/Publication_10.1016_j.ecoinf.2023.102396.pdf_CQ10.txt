The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks compiled 
and published the wildlife harvest summaries of Wildlife Management 
Area (WMAs) from the 1980s to the 2000s in three reports (Mississippi 
Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 1990; Mississippi Depart-
ment of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 1998; Mississippi Department of 
Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, 2006). The number of harvested rabbits 
per hunter day (a day hunting trip), a capture per unit effort (CPUE) 
index, was calculated as the total number of reported harvests divided 
by  the  total  number of  hunter days  in  a  WMA for each  year.  Eastern 
cottontail  rabbits  (Sylvilagus  floridanus)  and  swamp  rabbits  (Sylvilagus
