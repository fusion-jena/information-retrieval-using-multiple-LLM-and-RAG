of districts within the NUTS3 units. 

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

This section presents the tools and statistical models used to analyse 
the dependencies in this article. The first tool that was helpful in pre- 
processing  the  data  was  standardization  (Williamson  and  Piattoeva, 
2019). This is a kind of normalization that allows changing the scope of 
individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical 
range. It should be emphasized here that this transformation preserves 
the distance relations between individual data. Thus, suppose one have a 
set of records xj ∈ ℝn, j = 1, …, m where n is the number of features. For 
each element j = 1, …, m, the variables are transformed as follows:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the use of data annotation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used for various tasks in machine learning and computer vision applications. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects or regions of interest in images or videos. Each bounding box is associated with a label indicating what object class it represents. This method is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike semantic segmentation, which only distinguishes different classes without identifying separate instances, instance segmentation aims to identify each distinct object instance within an image. This often involves creating pixel-level masks for each object instance.

3. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding boxes, polygons can also be drawn around objects or areas of interest. However, unlike bounding boxes, polygons allow for more precise outlining of irregular shapes.

4. Landmark/Keypoint Annotation: In some applications, such as facial recognition or pose estimation, it may be necessary to mark specific points on an object or person. These key points help define the structure or position of the subject being analyzed.

5. Text Annotation: This technique involves adding labels or tags to text data, typically for natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.

Without further context regarding the specific application or dataset discussed in the original document, it is impossible to determine which, if any, of these annotation techniques were employed.
