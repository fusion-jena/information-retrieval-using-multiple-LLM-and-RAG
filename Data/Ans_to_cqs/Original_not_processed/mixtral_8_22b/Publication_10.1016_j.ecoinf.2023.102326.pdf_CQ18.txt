Fig. 3. Average Shortest path length (ASPL) by daytime, grouped by land use type. Depicted are all 23 recording sites (Automatic Aural Devices (AAD)) and their 
respective ASPL diel cycle. ASPL values are centered on the mean to put emphasis on the individual course of ASPL. Blue color means that the value for the respective 
hour is above and red color that the value is below the mean. The mean of all ASPL values per site is given by a.

research approach is tailored towards the analysis of diel cycles, it was to 
be expected that the absolute values of the data may not provide a clear 
distinction between the LUMs of all locations being studied.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research paper does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the information available, we can infer that the authors used bootstrapping techniques to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average shortest path length (ASPL) for each hour by device. This could be considered as one way to monitor the model performance during training. Additionally, they also calculated the R2-thresholds for all 24 hours of the day, which might have been used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. But without explicit details about the monitoring strategy, this remains speculative.
