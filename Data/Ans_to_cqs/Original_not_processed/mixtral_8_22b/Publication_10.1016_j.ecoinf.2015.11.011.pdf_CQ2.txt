2.3. Pre-processing of imagery

the histogram of values for the band in question for breakpoints
in order to choose thresholds. Different bands were helpful for
segmenting and classifying different images. For 2009 NAIP images,
NDVI as well as mean values of different bands (e.g., green, infra-red),
or overall image brightness were often helpful (and for one site, Bald
Hills, per-pixel texture variables calculated for the red band in addition
to the image bands and NDVI were needed in order to discriminate
between classes); for historical imagery the image brightness value
worked well, in addition to contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity and
second moment (see Supplementary data for example eCognition rule
sets).

For the 2009 NAIP imagery, we used all four bands (R, G, B and IR)
and per-pixel NDVI, and for historical imagery we used the image
brightness and the six GLCM texture measures. We ﬁrst used multi-
resolution segmentation with a large scale parameter to mask forest
and prairie from each other, and then multi-threshold segmentation
on various bands to classify within those areas (Gärtner et al., 2014).
Using ArcGIS's ‘classify’ tool for raster symbology, we examined

combined with supervised classiﬁcation techniques to assist with dis-
cerning oak from conifer. Dendrochronology through tree cores, or al-
ternative historical imagery from a similar time period, might provide
samples for the supervised classiﬁcation of the historical photos.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the use of any specific data format such as image, audio, video, or CSV in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the pre-processing of imagery using different bands like RGB, Infrared, and NDVI, which suggests that the input data is likely in image format. The text also mentions the use of GLCM texture measures, indicating that the data could be processed as matrices or arrays. Additionally, there is no explicit reference to the use of deep learning algorithms or pipelines in this context. Therefore, based on the given information, it can only be inferred that the data format used is most likely image data.
