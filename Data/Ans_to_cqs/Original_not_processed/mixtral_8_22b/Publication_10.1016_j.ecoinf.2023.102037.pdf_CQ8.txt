2021a; Wang et al., 2020c). Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained 
a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 (Red-
mon  and  Farhadi,  2018)  while  detecting  and  classifying  pest  species 
from  the  images  in  their  “Pest24”  dataset.  The  dataset  consisted  of 
25,378  annotated  images  coming  from  24  pest  species  that  were  all 
collected by an automatic imaging trap. Rustia et al. (2021) designed a 
multi-stage deep learning method including object detection, insect vs. 
non-insect  separation  and  a  multi-class  insect  classification  for  insect 
identification. Data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices 
installed  in  greenhouses  –  under  varying  lighting environments  -  and 
their classification model reached average F1-scores of up to 0.92. Hong

toring  the  black  pine  bast  scale  (M.  thungergianae)  which  reached  a

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, there are references to two repositories related to similar topics. One is Skalski's 'Make Sense' project available on GitHub (<https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense/>), but it seems unrelated to the specific topic of this research. Another reference is to the SmartProtect platform (<https://platform.smartprotect-h2020.eu/en/search?applications%5B0%5D=4>), but again, it doesn't seem directly linked to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the papers. Therefore, without further context or information, we cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
