Bayesian  Optimization  to  minimize  a  5  k-fold  cross-validation  loss 
during model development (Section 2.7).

Among  machine  learning  techniques,  random  forest  models  have 
been found to be particularly effective and are used here due to their 
demonstrated robust performance for a wide range of contexts. The use 
of  random  forests  in  a  variety  of  areas  of  remote  sensing  is  well- 
documented  (Baret and  Buis, 2008; Bonsoms  and  Boulet, 2022; Chan 
and Paelinckx, 2008; Maxwell et al., 2018; Zheng and Jia, 2022) and 
motivated by flexibility in hyperparameter selection, input dimension-
ality, and data volume. Random forest models are a class of machine 
learning methods referred to as ensemble learning, an architecture that 
operates by generating many randomized decision trees based on sub-
sets of the input features (Breiman, 2001). By averaging the results from 
each tree, the model produces a more reliable result than any one tree 
could produce. The number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods are

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization during the model development process. This suggests that Bayesian Optimization was employed to optimize the parameters of the machine learning model, which in this case is a Random Forest model. It should be noted that while Bayesian Optimization can be used for hyperparameter tuning in various types of machine learning models, including deep learning models, the context only discusses its application within the Random Forest framework. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively state whether optimization techniques like SGD or Adam were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
