Fig. C1. 95% Bootstrap intervals of the average shortest path length (ASPL) for each hour by device. For each hour per device, 100 Bootstrap samples were build and 
the 97.5 and 2.5 quantiles of the ASPL values were calculated.

where V is the set of nodes in the network, d is the shortest path between 
respective nodes s and t, and n is the number of nodes in the network. 
Thus, ASPL can be described as the minimum number of “steps” it takes 
to  “go”  from  each  node  to  all  other  nodes,  normalized  by  the  total 
number of nodes in the network. Therefore, its value is dependent on the 
number  of  connections  and  the  topology  of  these  connections.  For 
example, we can see that the nodes for “Main Street”  in Fig. 1 are (i) 
more  frequently  connected  and  that  (ii)  their  connections  are  more 
homogeneously distributed than in “Urban Forest”. In the latter, we can 
see clear rectangular structures, which makes it more “complicated” to

cluster. Depicted are the ten largest land use types, which in total occupy >94% of the 50 m buffer area.

Depicted are AAD_ID, the land use type of all sites, R2-Thresholds (calculated as median from thresholds for all 24 h of day), 
average  shortest  path  length  (ASPL;  averaged  over  all  ASPL  values  for  24  h  of  day  by  device)  and  standard  deviation  (STD; 
calculated between all ASPL values for 24 h of day).

However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;
