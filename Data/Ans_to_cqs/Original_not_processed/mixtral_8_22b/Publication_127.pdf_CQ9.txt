A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

Perhaps most importantly, our results show that using deep-
learning technology can save a tremendous amount of time for
biology researchers and the human volunteers that help them
by labeling images. In particular, for animal identiﬁcation, our
system can save 99.3% of the manual labor (>17,000 h) while
performing at the same 96.6% accuracy level of human volun-
teers. This substantial amount of human labor can be redirected
to other important scientiﬁc purposes and also makes knowledge
extraction feasible for camera-trap projects that cannot recruit
large armies of human volunteers. Automating data extraction
can thus dramatically reduce the cost to gather valuable infor-
mation from wild habitats and will thus likely enable, catalyze,
and improve many future studies of animal behavior, ecosystem
dynamics, and wildlife conservation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not appear that there is any explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine which specific data repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, etc.) contains the relevant data for this deep learning pipeline.
