%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based on the available information.
