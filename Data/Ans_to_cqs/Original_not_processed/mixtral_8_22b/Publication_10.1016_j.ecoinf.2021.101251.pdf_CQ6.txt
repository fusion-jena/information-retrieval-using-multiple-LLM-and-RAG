like processing, cleaning, and curation of the data (the ESIP Research 
Object  Citation  Cluster  is  addressing  this  now).  The  importance  of 
acknowledging these roles increases when data are synthesized and/or 
transformed,  as  the integration  process requires  extensive intellectual 
effort.

The practice of data publication to date had been modeled using the 
paper publication processes as a guide (Borgman, 2016; Silvello, 2018). 
Data producers are typically also the authors of the data publication and 
make decisions on how to package the data using a variety of consid-
erations, including: order of authors who need to be included, theme of 
the  data,  time  range  of  the  data,  type  of  data,  expected  usage  needs, 
project goals, sponsoring organization, and/or scale of the data. Once 
the data have been submitted to a repository with appropriate metadata 
describing  the  data,  they  are  ideally  reviewed  by  the  repository  and 
published (e.g., Kakalia et al., 2019; O’Brien et al., 2016). Typically, the 
repository  assigns  a  DOI  to  each  published  dataset  and  provides  an 
automated  citation  using  DOI  schema  metadata  fields  (e.g.,  authors, 
title,  publication  year,  publisher)  (Fenner  et  al.,  2019).  Another

the best way for data producers to receive credit but are time consuming 
and  result  in  a  static  view  of  the  data.  Challenging  decisions  such  as 
defining  authorship  and  following  usage  policy  requirements  such  as 
attribution are not directly solved. In cases where usage rules for the 
integrated data are not the same, a method for unifying the data usage 
policies is needed. In our experience, treating all the data as having the 
most restrictive policy can work if the policies are compatible. That is an 
approach  we used  with FLUXNET  which  often  has  two different  data 
usage policies.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can infer from the context that some common preprocessing steps might include processing, cleaning, and curating the data. These steps could involve tasks like normalizing or scaling numerical features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers. It is important to note that the exact preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being trained.
