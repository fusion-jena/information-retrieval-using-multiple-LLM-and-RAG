2.5. Automated machine learning (AutoML) 

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed. 

2.5.1. AutoGluon

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

2.5.1. AutoGluon 

AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML library designed to democra-
tize machine learning, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. It 
simplifies  the  process  of  training  high-performance  ML  models  on 
structured  data  with  minimal  code.  The  approach  behind  AutoGluon 
emphasizes  advanced  data  processing,  deep  learning,  and  ensemble 
techniques,  rather  than  just  algorithm  selection  and  hyperparameter 
tuning.  It  automates  feature  engineering,  data  pre-processing,  model 
training,  and  ensembling,  utilizing  methods  like  multi-layer  stacking 
and  neural  network  embeddings.  The  core  training  strategy  of  Auto-
Gluon can be summarized in the following steps:  

(1)  AutoGluon trains a collection of ML models M = (m1, m2, …, mn) 
on the training data, including neural networks, tree ensembles, 
and more.

The suitability of data-driven model predictions depends largely on 
both the quality and quantity of the data used to develop the models 
(Arashpour, 2023). A small training dataset often will lead to overfitting 
issues when developing machine learning models (Jiang et al., 2022). 
There can be several reasons for this, but typically this occurs because 
the small dataset do not satisfactorily represent all possible input data 
combinations. Lack of data will also force the model to learn from the 
noise  and  describe  it,  rather  than  capture  the  data  trends  (Peng  and 
Nagata,  2020).  In  the  context  of  modelling  fire  behaviour,  obtaining 
sufficient  experimental  or  wildfire  spread  data  is  challenging  due  to 
operational, safety, and legal constraints (Anderson et al., 2015); with 
the field of study considered to be data poor (Gould et al. 2024). Syn-
thetic data generation provides a method to enhance real-world datasets

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, I can provide some general insights regarding data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation involves labeling raw data to help train machine learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images or videos to identify their location. It is widely used in object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves assigning labels to every pixel in an image, allowing the model to understand the overall scene better. It is useful for applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Each distinct object receives its own unique label.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves manually outlining complex shapes using polygons. It is particularly helpful for irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark/Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object to define its structure or shape. It is frequently used in facial recognition systems.

6. Text Annotation: This technique involves adding textual descriptions or tags to images, audio clips, or video files. It helps improve search functionality and content organization.
