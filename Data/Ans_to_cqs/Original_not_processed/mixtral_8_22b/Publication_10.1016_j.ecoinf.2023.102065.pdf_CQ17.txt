LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020). Tuning of the network hyperparameters and convolutional filters 
provides automated feature learning, thereby removing an obstacle of 
earlier  machine  learning  methods  (Gupta  et  al.,  2021).  Sound  data 
include frequency, amplitude and temporal information, and there are 
different  approaches  to  express  these  data  in  CNN  architectures.  One 
approach is to represent sound data as amplitude-time waveforms, then 
train  1-dimensional  neural  network  architectures,  such  as  Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify distinct patterns (Sang et al., 2018; 
Weninger and Schuller, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021). Another approach is 
to  train  CNNs  to  classify  2D  image  spectrograms  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021; 
LeBien et al., 2020; Ruff et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2020).  A  popular  extension  is  to  use  mel-spectrograms  from  human

architectures of deep convolutional neural networks. Artif. Intell. Rev. 53 (8),

Helpful Answer:
The papers provided do not explicitly mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, some common regularization methods used in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust to small changes in input data. L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function based on the weights of the connections between nodes in the network, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing overfitting. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping when it starts to increase, indicating that the model has begun to overfit. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations to existing ones, increasing the size and diversity of the training data and helping to reduce overfitting.
