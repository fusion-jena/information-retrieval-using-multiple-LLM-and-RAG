time variable, and kNDVIj represents the maximum kNDVI value in the 
jth  year.  A  positive  slope  denotes  a  vegetation  improvement  trend 
(kNDVI greening), while a negative slope indicates a degradation trend 
in  vegetation  (kNDVI  browning).  The  significance  of  the  trends  was 
evaluated using the F test. Following the criteria outlined in Table 3 and 
derived from prior studies(Lai et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b), the kNDVI 
trends were categorized into four types.

2.3.3. Optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD)  

(i)  Optimal scale and discretization parameters 

As OPGD requires continuous data to be discretized before further 
analysis,  choosing  appropriate  discretization  parameters  (i.e.,  the 
number and method of discretization breakpoints) is crucial for accurate 
identification  of  driver  explanatory  power.  The  discretization  process 
involved  five  methods:  standard  deviation  (SD),  natural  breaks  (NB), 
equal  interval  (EI),  quantile  (QU),  and  geometric  interval  (GI)(Song 
et al., 2020). Following previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 
2023), we considered that too many or too few breakpoints would result 
in  information  redundancy  (insufficiency).  Therefore,  the  number  of 
breakpoints was configured to range from 4 to 13 in this study.

In accordance with established practices (Peng et  al., 2019; Wang 
et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2023b), the NDVI is usually classified into five 
intervals with a 0.2 interval. However, this standard classification is not 
suitable for the MRB because the kNDVI ranges between 0 and 0.75. To 
facilitate  a  meaningful  comparison  of  temporal  changes  in  the  pro-
portions of various levels of kNDVI in the MRB, we opted for an interval 
of  0.15.  Consequently,  we  redefined  a  classification  criterion,  catego-
rizing the original kNDVI data into five levels: Poor, Inferior, Medium, 
Good, and Excellent, as detailed in Table 2.
