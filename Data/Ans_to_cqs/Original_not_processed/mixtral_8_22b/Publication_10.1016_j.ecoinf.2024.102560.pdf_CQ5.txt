The CMAP is a collection of precipitation datasets that can be pro-
duced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipi-
and its temporal 
tation. The spatial resolution of the CMAP is 2.5
resolution is monthly. The data of CMAP can be downloaded from the 
NOAA repository (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html). 
Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water 
surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e. 1985 
to 2020). For this aim, the most suitable data in terms of identifiability 
(i.e. frames with cloud cover <10%) was selected. It takes eight “Landsat 
frames” to cover the entire Urmia Lake basin. In the present study, 150 
images from 1985 to 2020 were used to assess land cover variations in 
the  selected  basin.  To  minimize  the  radiometric  effects,  radiometric 
calibration was done for the selected images. 

2.2. Description of the adapted methodology

-  Satellite-based datasets 

In this study, The MODIS and CMAP datasets were used for drought 
monitoring. These MODIS datasets were extracted from the cloud-based 
Google  Earth  Engine  (GEE)  platform.  GEE  provides  various  types  of 
ready-to-use products derived from satellite imagery (https://eartheng 
ine.google.com).  The  16-day  composite  MODIS  vegetation  product  at 
a 250-m spatial resolution (MOD13Q1) was used to calculate NDVI at 
250 m. MOD13Q1 includes vegetation indices quality control for both 
vegetation  indicators  and  surface  reflectance  bands.  The  eight-day 
composite MODIS LST product at 1-km spatial resolution (MOD11A2) 
was  used  to obtain  day-time land  surface  temperature. MOD11A2  in-
cludes quality control for day-time LST and emissivity. 250 images (with 
cloud cover percentage <10%) were selected to assess drought varia-
tions in the selected basin.

In the next step, the potential of the remote sensing-based datasets 
was assessed for drought monitoring in the selected basin. For evalu-
ating the  efficiency of  the CMAP satellite data, the  mean annual pre-
cipitation  values  were  calculated  using  ground-  and  satellite-based 
datasets. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 6(a). From the results, 
there is a desirable correlation between the two datasets, so that the high 
and low precipitation areas of the basin are well identified by the sat-
ellite. A strong positive correlation can be seen between the precipita-
tion values obtained from the two datasets (Correlation Coefficient (R) 
> 0.8 and p < 0.001). After extracting the monthly precipitation datasets 
from the CMAP, the SPI time series were calculated and de-noised using 
the EWT method. Then, the basin was mapped in terms of drought and 
mean entropy. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 6(b). As could be

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The text does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several datasets used for different purposes within the research.

For instance, the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) dataset was used to analyze precipitation data and estimate satellite-based precipitation. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees and a temporal resolution of monthly. Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were employed to examine water surface area and salinity variations over a long period (1985 - 2020).

Furthermore, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets were utilized for drought monitoring. These datasets include the 16-day composite MODIS vegetation product (MOD13Q1) at a 250-meter spatial resolution and the eight-day composite MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) product (MOD11A2) at a one-kilometer spatial resolution.

However, these datasets are not typically associated with deep learning pipelines like those mentioned in the query. Instead, they are commonly used in geospatial analysis, climate studies, and environmental research.
