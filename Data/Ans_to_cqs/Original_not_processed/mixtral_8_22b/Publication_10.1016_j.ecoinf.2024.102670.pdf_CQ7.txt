An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance. Common ratios for this division are 60%, 20%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing respectively, but these may vary depending on the application and available data.
