Science and SCOPUS), curating specific search terms and synonyms and
used Boolean operators and wildcards (asterisks) to account for word
variants and plural forms. Additional information on search strategy are
provided in the Appendix A along with Table S1 showing all the terms
included in the final search. The literature search was conducted in
January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

analysis. However, while regression-based models remain prevalent (n
= 23), there was an increased use of machine learning techniques (n =
22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7
studies; e.g., Díaz L´opez and Methion, 2024).

while the first study used machine learning in 2007 with Classification
and Regression Tree (CART), Discriminant Analysis and then with the
integration of Maxent in 2010. Over the years, RB and ML approaches
experienced a proliferation in usage, encompassing various innovative
ML for both boosting and classification techniques that gained popu-
larity later on (e.g, RF, BRT, GBM, ANN), or distance-based and enve-
lope models (DIST-ENV) in 2001 and, more recently since 2018, the
models based on point-processes (PPMs). Additionally, the ensemble
modelling approach, where the results of different models are averaged
(ENS, n = 34, 11%), has also increased since its first use in 2013.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based solely on the given information. However, it is worth noting that the context discusses the use of deep learning strategies such as neural networks in ecological modeling, which may involve image analysis tasks like object detection or semantic segmentation. These tasks often require data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation to create labeled datasets for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific deep learning pipelines employed in these studies, I can only speculate on the potential data annotation techniques used.
