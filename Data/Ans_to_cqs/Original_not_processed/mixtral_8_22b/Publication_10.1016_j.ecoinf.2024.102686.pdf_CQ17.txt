In Eq. (4), η(t) is the learning rate, which decreases with time t, and 

Sk(t) is the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t.

2.4.4. Clustering quality index (CQI) 

Owing to the characteristics of unsupervised clustering of SOM net-
works,  changing  the  number  of  categories  significantly  affects  the 
clustering results, and determining the number of categories is the key to

large-scale partitioning (Srivastava and Bhambhu, 2005). However, the 
training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets is not ideal at pre-
sent (Amarappa and Sathyanarayana, 2024), and further optimization of 
the  training  algorithm  is  an  urgent  problem  that  needs  to  be  solved. 
Simultaneously, the boundaries delineated by SVM are not uniform with 
the  administrative  boundaries,  and  the  zoning  results  will  face  diffi-
culties in real applications, which is also a problem to be addressed in 
the future. Because of the increasing long-distance HAs and the remote 
deployment of material and energy, the ability of remote connectivity 
will  be  an  important  driver  of  future  regional  differentiation  (J.  Jiao 
et al., 2020). Quantifying this ability and incorporating it into HA–NE 
coupled zoning will be a topic addressed in future studies.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or outliers in the training data instead of generalizing patterns from the entire dataset. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons. This method prevents any single feature from dominating the others and encourages the network to distribute its capacity across all features. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. By adding this penalty, the model tries to minimize both the error on the training set and the size of the coefficients. As a result, the model becomes more robust against overfitting because smaller coefficient values lead to simpler models that generalize better.

Both Dropout and L2 Regularization can be combined and applied simultaneously to improve the performance of deep learning models. Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization (also called Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the appropriate one depends on the specific use case and requirements.
