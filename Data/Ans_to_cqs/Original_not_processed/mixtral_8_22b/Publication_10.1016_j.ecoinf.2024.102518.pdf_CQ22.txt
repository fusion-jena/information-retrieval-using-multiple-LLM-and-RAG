feature class as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and set the regularization multiplier 
from 0.5 to 5, using the delta in the Akaike minimum information cri-
terion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parame-
ters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value 
(delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible 
(Phillips et al., 2017). The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI)(Hirzel et al., 
2006) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) because AUC-ROC is not reliable 
when  obtaining  true  absences  is  challenging  (Jim´enez  and  Sober´on, 
2020). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 
‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5 (Fig. A.2). The mean AUC- 
ROC  stands  at 95.5%,  while the  average  CBI  index  for the  validation 
dataset is 82.6%.

cross-validation. The threshold was derived from the average output of 
the five models. Nine algorithms—Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM 
(gaussian),  GLM  (binomial),  GLM  (poisson),  MaxEnt,  Random  Forest, 
and SVM—were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. 
Our analysis revealed that MaxEnt emerged as the most suitable model, 
striking  a  commendable  balance  between  accuracy  and  robustness 
(Fig. A.1).

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: the Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The AUC-ROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes, while the CBI evaluates the goodness of fit of the predicted probabilities against the observed data. In this case, the authors also use the delta in the Akaike Minimum Information Criteria (delta.AICc) to select the best tuning parameters for their model. They consider a model with delta.AICc <2 as credible and the optimal model has a minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc=0). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. The mean AUC-ROC stands at 95.5%, while the average CBI index for the validation dataset is 82.6%.
