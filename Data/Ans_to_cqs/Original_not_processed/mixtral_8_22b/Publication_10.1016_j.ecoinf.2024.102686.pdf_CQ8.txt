northwest of China's agro-pastoral ecotone, and includes 35 districts and 
counties (Fig. 1), spans two major basins, i.e., those of the Yellow River 
and Yangtze River, and encompasses an area of 99,300 km2 (Y. Xu et al., 
2021; J. Li et al., 2023). The study area is located in the intersection belt 
of major geographical units in China as well as in the transition area 
from the first to the second step, with the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau in the 
west, Loess Plateau in the east, and Qinba Mountains in the south. The
