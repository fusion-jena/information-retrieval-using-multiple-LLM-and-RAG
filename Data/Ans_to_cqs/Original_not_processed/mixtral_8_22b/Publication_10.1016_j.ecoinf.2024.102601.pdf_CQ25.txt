In the domain of WSM utilizing ML models, optimizing data struc-
tures is paramount. Our study’s engagement with this challenge has led 
to identifying efficient data structures for ML classification. This opti-
mization focuses on the strategic selection of predictors from S2 imagery 
and  the  integration  of  XAI  techniques.  Specifically,  we  optimize  the 
input  matrix  X  = i  × j,  where  I  represents  the  number  of  predictors 
(columns) and j represents the number of training points (rows). We aim 
to select the 12 most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance

Our study leverages ML for multi-layer classification to accurately 
identify  areas  affected  by  wildfires.  Given  the  critical  importance  of 
precision in wildfire mapping, we evaluated our model’s performance 
using two primary metrics, OA and Cohen’s Kappa statistic, which are 
vital for understanding the model’s effectiveness. 

OA  is  the  proportion  of  correctly  predicted  instances  (wildfire- 
affected  and  unaffected  areas)  out  of  the  total  instances  evaluated. 
Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, given the information available, it can be inferred that the model is used for multi-layer classification. This is evident from the statement "Our study leverages ML for multi-layer classification to accurately identify areas affected by wildfires." Therefore, the main objective of the deep learning model is to classify different regions into those affected by wildfires and those unaffected.

Additionally, the study aims to optimize data structures for machine learning classification, focusing on selecting the most relevant predictors from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. This suggests that the input to the model consists of satellite images, and the output is a binary classification indicating whether each region is affected by wildfires or not. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics mentioned, such as overall accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic, support the conclusion that the model is designed for classification tasks.
