Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Appendix A. Network architectures 

The network architectures of the models evaluated in the experiments are described in detail in Fig. 9. The light green areas in that figure represent 
feature extractor modules based on the different architectures, i.e., VGG, ResNet, and Xception. The orange area represents the architecture of the 
classifier module, to which the outputs of each feature extractor are submitted.

3.2. ResNet 

Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et al. (2016), aimed at 
improving convergence issues during the training of very deep network 
architectures. ResNet is a deep learning model that aims to alleviate two 
main  problems  in  training  neural  networks.  The  first  problem  is  the 
vanishing  gradient,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  optimize  the  model 
during training. The second is the degradation problem, which occurs 
when  adding  more  layers  to  a  deep  neural  network  leads  to  greater 
training errors. ResNet solved those problems by using residual learning 
blocks between layers of the network, allowing for better optimization 
and higher training accuracy.

identify  morphology  classes;  and  another  for  S/W  fragments  classes. 
Considering  the  different  ResNet  variants  (see  Section  3.2),  networks 
based on six different architectures (i.e., VGG, ResNet18 V1, ResNet50 
V1,  ResNet18  V2,  ResNet50  V2,  and  Xception)  were  trained  for  each 
substratum type and site.

Variants  of  the  VGG  network  have  demonstrated  that  increasing 
network  depth  can  improve  classification  accuracy  by  enabling  the 
learning  of  semantically  enriched  features.  In  the  present  work,  we 
adopted a particular architecture inspired by VGG that has 14 layers (13 
convolutional  and  one  dense  layer).  A  detailed  description  of  the  ar-
chitecture implemented in this work can be found in Section 7.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of various network architectures such as VGG, ResNet, and Xception but does not provide any details about the programming framework or library employed to implement these architectures. Therefore, I cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or some other framework was utilized.
