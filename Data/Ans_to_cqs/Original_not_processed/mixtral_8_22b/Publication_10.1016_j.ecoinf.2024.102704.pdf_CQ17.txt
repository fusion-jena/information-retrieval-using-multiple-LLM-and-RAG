several  times  higher  than  those  of  other  operations  (Li  et  al.,  2018). 
Therefore,  reducing  memory  access  is  the  key  to  further  enhancing 
model  performance.  By  reconfiguring  the  computation  sequence  of 
‘convolutional layer + batch normalisation + activation layer on NVI-
DIA TESLA V100 GPUs, Wang et al. (2019) reduced memory access by 
33%,  22%,  and  31%  for  the  ResNet-50,  Inception  V3,  and  DenseNet 
models,  respectively,  leading  to  increases  in  the  computational  effi-
ciency  of  20.5%,  18.5%,  and  18.1%.  Lowering  the  memory  access  in 
models can accelerate operations across the three main layers of CNNs, 
thus fully harnessing the model's strengths and more effectively utilising 
the computational resources provided by the embedded devices (Gilan 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, by reducing the number of 
layers  in  the  network  model,  the  number  of  convolutions  and  data

(n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x). These scales 
meet the requirements of various scenarios and tasks. As scale increases, 
so does the network depth and width of the model; therefore, ‘n’  rep-
resents the smallest and fastest scale, whereas ‘x’ is the largest and offers 
the  highest  accuracy.  Although  the  accuracy  improves  as  the  model 
depth increases, this also leads to changes in the number of parameters, 
amount  of  computation,  and  detection  speed,  with  correspondingly 
higher demands on the hardware configuration. To delve deeper into the 
underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed, 
we utilised LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to train 
across  four  scales:  n,  s,  m,  and  l.  As  Fig.  9  illustrates,  reducing  the 
number  of  parameters  in  the  various  models  does  not  enhance  the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from dominating the others. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and stopping when it starts to increase, indicating that the model may be beginning to overfit. Data augmentation generates new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation or scaling to existing images, increasing the size of the training set and making the model more generalizable. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, improving convergence and reducing overfitting.
