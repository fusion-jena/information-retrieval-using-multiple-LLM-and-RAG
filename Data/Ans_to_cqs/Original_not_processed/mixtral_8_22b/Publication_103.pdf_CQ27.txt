Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

very beginning the weights of ImageNet were used.
For example, H1KI.PC.PC means the transfer
learning was progressive, done from ImageNet, to
Herbarium1K, to PlantCLEF, and tested with
PlantCLEF data.

• Initialization: weights used to initialize the model.
• Training: training set used (e.g., Herbarium255

training set, PlantCLEF training set, etc.)

• Testing: test set used (e.g., Herbarium255 test set,

PlantCLEF test set, etc.)

• Top-1/Top-5: accuracy achieved with top-1 and

top-5 best predictions, respectively.

no collector was shared by the training and testing sets
to avoid bias in the data. The following four experiments
were conducted:

• R.H255.H255: The neural network was initialized

randomly, trained on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

Table 1 shows the modified GoogleNet model with
the batch normalization added outside the Inception
modules. Just like the original GoogleNet, the model is
comprised of several inception modules, however Batch
Normalization is added inside each inception module for
faster convergence right after each pooling layer. Figure 1
shows how the modified Inception module is comprised.
The model was implemented by using the Caffe frame-
work [37]. A batch size of 16 images was used for each
iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075 with images of
224×224 resolution. Simple crop and resize data augmen-
tation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning projects, once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed through various methods such as model serialization or platform selection.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters into a file format that can later be loaded back into memory for making predictions. This serialized model can then be integrated into applications or services where its functionality is required. Common formats for model serialization include.h5 files for Keras models,.pth files for PyTorch models, and.pb files for TensorFlow models.

Platform selection refers to choosing a suitable environment for running the trained model. Depending on the use case, this could range from cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, to edge devices like mobile phones or IoT devices. Each platform may have specific requirements regarding hardware resources, software libraries, and APIs, which need to be considered during the deployment phase.

In summary, while the exact process for deploying the trained deep learning model mentioned in the context cannot be determined due to insufficient information, typical steps involve model serialization and selecting an appropriate platform for executing the model.
