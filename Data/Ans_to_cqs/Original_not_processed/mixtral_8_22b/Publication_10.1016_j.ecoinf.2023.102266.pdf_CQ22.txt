5.1. Limitations of the model as a classification model 

Our classification model is built upon the Monte Carlo method. While 
Monte Carlo codes have achieved significant sophistication, simulations 

suffer  from  the  drawback  of  demanding  extensive  computational  re-
sources  to  attain  an  adequate  level  of  result  confidence.  Hence,  it  is 
crucial to acknowledge the associated limitations. 

Specifically, a substantial number of tests may be required. Insuffi-
cient  testing  could  lead  to  a  heightened  sampling  error,  resulting  in 
overly broad confidence intervals. Ensuring an ample number of trials is 
crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates.

Therefore, while our classification model harnesses the power of the 
Monte Carlo method, its practical application requires careful consid-
eration  of  the  computational  challenges  and  the  need  for  a  sufficient 
number of trials to ensure reliable results. Exploring innovative variance 
reduction  techniques  (Kleijnen  et  al.,  2010;  Botev  and  Ridder,  2017) 
would help to improve the model’s accuracy and broaden its applica-
bility in future research and real-world applications. 

5.2. Application to a real wildfire 

Since our model can be used as a Monte Carlo method, we apply it to 
a  real  case.  We  consider  the  wildfire  in  Vall  de  Gallinera  (Valencian 
Community, Spain) in August 2020, see Fig. 10. This is part of a database 
of  wildfires  in  our  community,  which  we  are  setting  up,  see  Supple-
mentary Data. 

Then, the estimate that our model would make is given by Fig. 12, 

assuming Fig. 11 as our climate conditions for θ and ρ.

model that we address in Section 6. 

After discussing the interdependency and range parameters can take, 
our aim now is to justify why E is a reliable measure to anticipate the rate 
of expansion and therefore to establish a hierarchy and a direct search 
for the optimal parameters. When we want to conclude the impact of 
parameters  on  the  expected  rate  of  expansion,  the  study  cannot  be 
limited to specific data from a particular phenomenon, since there is a 
great variety of climatic conditions and potential wind-driven events. 
This could introduce a bias into our study so, the best way for conducting 
the aforementioned study is to simulate climatic data by means of 

θ ∼ Unif (0, 2 π) and ρ ∼ Unif (0, 1).

First of all, we set an arbitrary partition 

P := {0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1}

estimates of the state of the cells in each time step, considering a level of confidence. In this way, the model 
provides a tool to obtain a quantitative estimate of the probability associated with each state in the spread of 
forest fires.
