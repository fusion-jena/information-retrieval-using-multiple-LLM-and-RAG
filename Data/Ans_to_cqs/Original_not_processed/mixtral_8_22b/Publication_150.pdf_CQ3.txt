information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131

0.01 for all models except MansNet, which was initially set at 0.1. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of

Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are at the forefront of computer 
vision. More commonly applied in the fields of self-driving  cars22 and healthcare  diagnostics23, researchers are 
beginning to apply CNNs to insect detection and  identification21,24–26. Mobile apps such as Seek (inaturalist.org/
pages/seek_app) and Google Lens (lens.google.com) can be used to identify some taxa but species-level accuracy 
for bees in these apps is not sufficient for research purposes.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss various architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, which have been employed for tasks like insect detection and identification. These architectures are typically used in conjunction with labeled datasets, where each image is assigned one or multiple labels corresponding to its content.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images and assigning them appropriate labels. It is widely used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: Here, every pixel in an image is assigned a label based on the object or region it belongs to. This technique is often utilized for scene understanding applications.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation also aims to classify every pixel in an image. However, it goes a step further by differentiating between instances of the same class. For example, if there are two dogs in an image, instance segmentation would distinguish between them, whereas semantic segmentation might group them together under the 'dog' category.

4. Polygon Annotation: This method involves outlining complex shapes using polygons instead of simple rectangles. It is particularly helpful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this technique involves marking specific points on objects of interest. It is frequently used in facial recognition systems and pose estimation tasks.

While the given context does not provide explicit details about the data annotation techniques used, it is reasonable to assume that one or more of these methods may have been employed during dataset creation for training the mentioned CNN architectures.
