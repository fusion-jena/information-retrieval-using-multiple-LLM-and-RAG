More recently, there has been a great effort to automate the process 
of classification/mapping of specific targets using Deep Learning (Lecun 
et al., 2015) algorithms, such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN), which 
includes  a  learning  algorithm  based  on  an  artificial  neural  network 
(Langford et al., 2019). In this study, we developed a semi-automatic 
methodological approach for mapping burned areas in the entire Cer-
rado  biome  in  Brazil  using  Deep  Learning  techniques  available  on 
Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery, which consist of eleven 
spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1-7 and 9, 
15 meters for band 8, and 100 meters for bands 10 and 11. We did not 
use  Landsat-7  imagery  because  of  the  data  gaps  observed  images  ac-
quired after 2003, which would substantially affect the spatial coverage 
of  our  analysis.  We  assessed  accuracies  and  compared  our  mapping

The  algorithm  includes  two  steps:  training  and  prediction.  In  the 
training phase, the following parameters where defined, based on tests: 
the  learning  rate  (0.001),  the  batch  size  (1,000),  the  number  of  in-
teractions  (7,000),  and  the  inputs  for  classification  were  the  spectral 
data acquired from the training samples of spectral bands defined based 
on the burned and non-burned areas. The following Lansat-8 spectral 
bands were used for the classification model of burned areas: red (RED - 
0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 
1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). In addition to those selected spectral 
bands, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalizes Burned Index) were 
tested. The Landsat spectral bands were chosen because of their sensi-
tiveness to fire events. The input of the training data was split into two

We used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images 
and Deep Neural Network models to detect and map burned areas within 
the  Cerrado  biome.  The  image  processing  and  classification  followed 
four steps as follows: (1) collecting spectral training samples of burned 
and non-burned areas for the entire study area, well distributed in space, 
(2) training the deep learning models, (3) developing model prediction, 
and (4) model assessment (validation and concordance analysis). Fig. 2 
uses  step-by-step  bases  to  show  all  details  of  our  methodological 
approach for detecting and mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome 
in 2017.

Since  deep  learning  methods  require  a  powerful  computational 
processing, we conducted our analysis using graphics processing units 
(GPUs)  and  specialized  hardware  components  for  running  parallel 
arithmetic operations (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The access to GPUs in a 
virtual  machine  environment  was  implemented  on  the  Google  Cloud 
suite  of  cloud

3.1. Optimal period of burn scar mapping 

The fire hotspot data analysis provided by INPE (http://www.inpe. 
br/queimadas/bdqueimadas)  indicates  that  most  of  the  fire  events  in 
the  Cerrado  biome  occurred  between  May  and  December,  showing  a 
peak in September 2017 (Fig. 4). Based on it, we focused our mapping 
analysis of burn scars on the period between May and December, which 
comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017 by INPE.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if some pixels in the Landsat 8 imagery have no data due to sensor malfunction or atmospheric interference, these should be removed or filled in appropriately.

2. Feature Selection: Not all features (or variables) in a dataset may contribute equally to the task at hand. Therefore, selecting relevant features is crucial. In this case, the authors chose to use only certain spectral bands (red, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) and indices (NDVI, NBR, and delta NBR) known to be sensitive to fire events.

3. Data Transformation: This refers to converting raw data into a more suitable format for the model. Common transformations include normalization and standardization. However, the paper does not explicitly mention whether these were performed.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the amount of training data and prevent overfitting, synthetic examples can be generated through various means like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. Again, the paper does not indicate whether this technique was employed.
