Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

the  shortcut  connections  within  the  network  that  makes  the  training 
faster; bottleneck architecture which consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional 
layer  for  dimension  reduction,  3  × 3  convolution  layer  for  feature 
extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension resto-
ration;  shortcut  connections  which  allows  gradients  to  flow  directly 
through  the  network  due  to  the  input  added  directly  to  the  output; 
global  average  pooling  (GAP)  which  computes  spatial  average  of  the 
feature  maps  at  the  end  section  of  the  convolutional  layer;  and  skip 
connections which bypass multiple residual blocks. On the other hand, 
InceptionV3 is a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters with 
enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers 
in order to easily propagate the information from the input to the output

considerable  model  for  real-time  classification  problems.  As  said,  the 
goal of this study is to develop the BivalveNet which is the best deep 
network  that  could  sensitively  and  specifically  identify  the  sampling 
location of the provided bivalve shell image. Here, six combinations of 
LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM were configured followed by a fully connected 
layer and classification layer (Figs. 4(d) and 4(e)). For all these three 
neural network-based sequence layers, the first, second, and third layers 
consist  of  1000,  500,  and  100  hidden  artificial  neurons,  respectively.
