Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

IF (DistMr is UP) OR (DistSr is UP) OR (DistMWr is UP) OR (DistOWr 

is UP) THEN (DistSuit is UP). 

IF (DistMr is AP) OR (DistSr is AP) OR (DistMWr is AP) OR (DistOWr 

is AP) THEN (DistSuit is AP). 

The effective solution of our tree-based FIS in Apis-FIS, the last node 
of  our  architecture  with  two  input  Prox-FIS  and  LCWT-FIS.  For  the 
output  of  Apis-FIS,  we  used  triangular  and  trapezoidal  membership 
function  with  five  fuzzy  sets  for  the  output  with:  “very  low  suitable” 
(VLS), “low suitable” (LS), “moderate suitable” (MS), “suitable” (S) and 
“highly suitable” (HS) for linguistic variables appear in Fig. 10.

The rules for this Apis-FIS subsystem are: 
IF (LCWTSuit is VL) THEN (ApisSuit is VLS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is L) OR (DistSuit is UP) THEN (ApisSuit is LS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is M) THEN (ApisSuit is MS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is H) OR (DistSuit is AP) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is HS) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
To  implement  our  FIS  models,  we  use  the  fuzzy  logic  toolbox  of 
Matlab 2023b. This toolbox provides large capabilities to choose several 
membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

2.3.2. Architecture of tree-based FIS model 

A  tree-based  FIS  is  a  system  of  interconnected  sub-FIS  models  ar-
ranged in a cascade structure. Each subsystem outputs are then used as 
inputs  for  the  next  subsystem  or  the  final  decision,  forming  a  hierar-
ˇ
Sindel´aˇr,  2005;  Torra,  2002).  Depending  on  the 
chical  structure  (
application and computational efficiency, several configurations can be 
used  (Mutlu  et  al.,  2018;  Torra,  2002).  Hybrid  architectures,  for 
example, are suitable for modelling systems with high uncertainty and 
correlated variables (Mutlu et  al., 2018). We decided to use a hybrid 
architecture, as shown in Fig. 6. Our system is divided into three simple 
subsystems (Wth-FIS for weather, Topo-FIS for topography, Prox-FIS for

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of using any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it appears that the authors have utilized Matlab 2023b's fuzzy logic toolbox to develop their FIS models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which deep learning framework was used since none were mentioned in the provided context.
