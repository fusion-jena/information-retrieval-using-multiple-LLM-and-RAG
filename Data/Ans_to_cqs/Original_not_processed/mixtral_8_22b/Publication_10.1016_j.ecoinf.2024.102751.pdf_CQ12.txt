Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

method was used to estimate the model parameters, recommended by
the authors of the mgcv library (Ingrosso et al., 2023). Automatic
elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory
variable was chosen. The parameter ‘select = T’ indicated that the
smoothing parameter estimation, part of model fitting, could completely
remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. Due to the
skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC a gamma distribution
with natural logarithm as the linking function was used for modeling.
The accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed
using the ‘yardstick’ package for R, specifically the ‘metrics’ function.
Three selected model parameters were calculated: RMSE (eq. 1), MAE
(eq. 2), and R2. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in pre-
dictions without considering their direction. RMSE is more sensitive to
outliers as it squares residuals. R2 represents the proportion of vari-

land reclamation. Forecasting accurate spatiotemporal soil moisture
pattern is a critical element for success of model. Topographic frame-
work is crucial for estimating digital elevation models are a vital part of
soil moisture modeling dynamics. Understanding the spatial and tem-
poral variability of soil moisture is essential for effective land manage-
ment, water resource allocation, and climate change adaptation
(Vereecken et al., 2014). This study delves into the complex interplay of
factors influencing soil moisture dynamics, harnessing the power of
multi-source data fusion to develop a predictive model for volumetric
water content (VWC) (Larson et al., 2022).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The given references do not provide any details about using a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, the conclusion mentions testing various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks in the future to increase the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, we can infer that no particular deep learning model has been implemented yet, but they plan to explore different options later.
