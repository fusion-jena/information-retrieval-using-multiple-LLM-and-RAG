1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world‚Äôs terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world‚Äôs  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‚ÄòMara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

the training subset. In this case, the total number of samples used for validation is 8. 

System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad, 

2015) was employed to perform classification utilising the RF technique, based on Red 

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

data with zero cloud cover over the test site, was selected for spectral modelling. Out of 

all the selected images, 9 cloud-free Sentinel-2 images from December 2020 to August 

2021 were downloaded from European Space Agency ESA's Copernicus Open Access 

Hub  (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).  Furthermore,  the  images  were  selected  based  on 

Martin-Rosset (2015) methodology..

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the research primarily involves the use of remote sensing images, specifically Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. These images are likely in a standard image format such as.jpg or.png. Additionally, Level 2A atmospherically and radiometrically corrected bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance products are also mentioned, suggesting the use of geospatial data formats commonly associated with satellite imagery. However, the exact file format is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, while we can infer that image data is being used, the specific file format remains unknown without further information.
