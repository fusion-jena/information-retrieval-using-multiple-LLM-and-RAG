• No-overfitting. In this setting, the optimization algorithm of CNNs is 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001 
and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of 
training epochs to 200 and finally the batch-norm and dropout (0.5) 
are used to reduce the overfitting level.  

• Overfitting.  We  use  the  same  hyperparameters  setting  as  the  no- 
overfitting  but  we  remove  the  use  of  batch-norm,  weight  decay 
and dropout techniques to ensure that the model overfits.

Strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively 
poses  a  significant  challenge  within  the  domain  of  deep  learning. 
Indeed, generalization refers to the variation in a model’s performance 
when applied to data it has been trained on, as opposed to data it en-
counters for the first time during testing. This issue is of fundamental 
importance and has far-reaching implications for applications employ-
ing  deep  neural  networks.  In  particular,  this  challenge  becomes

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there is mention of a dataset called the GREMM dataset, which was used for evaluating discrimination accuracy using Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA approaches. Unfortunately, without additional context, further details regarding the nature of the GREMM dataset cannot be determined.
