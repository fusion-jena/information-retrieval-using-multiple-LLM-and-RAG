more  recently,  deep  learning  techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  the 
generated data (Perakis et al., 2020; Swain et al., 2020). However, the

formation is presented to the end-users. There are two common purposes 
of developing  visualization systems  in the  smart system  to help users 
identify the trend of data or the pattern of data. The data visualization 
types  were  also  considered  to  deliver  insightful  information  to  users 
(Krisnawijaya et al., 2022). There are three types of visualization based 
on the generated information from the system, such as temporal infor-
mation  (represented  by  using  a  line  graph  or  scatter  plot),  multi- 
dimensional information (using a pie chart, Venn diagram, bar graph, 
or  histogram),  and  geospatial  information  (using  heat  or  flow  map).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that traditional data management systems are inadequate to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by sensors and IoT devices in smart farming applications. It also discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for analyzing this data. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used, they likely involve large volumes of diverse agricultural data collected through IoT devices and sensors.

Regarding general deep learning pipelines, popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets have been widely used for various computer vision tasks like image classification, object recognition, and segmentation. MNIST consists of handwritten digit images, CIFAR contains small natural images categorized into ten classes, and ImageNet is a vast dataset with over 14 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to around 22,000 categories.
