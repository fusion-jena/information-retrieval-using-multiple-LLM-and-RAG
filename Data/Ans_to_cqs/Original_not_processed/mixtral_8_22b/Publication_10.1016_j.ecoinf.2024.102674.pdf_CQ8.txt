over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses various aspects such as fitting Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) using specific packages in R, evaluating variable importance in Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and citing several scientific papers related to topics like microclimatic challenges in global change biology, optimizing input data for gridding climate normals, and downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography. However, there is no mention of any code repository or version control system used for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
