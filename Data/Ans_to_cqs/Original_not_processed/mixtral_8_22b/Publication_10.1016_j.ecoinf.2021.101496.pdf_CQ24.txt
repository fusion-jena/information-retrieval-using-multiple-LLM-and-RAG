value gained by SPAD-502Plus (Fig. 6). Furthermore, modelling of the 
SPAD  value  was  performed  by  a)  a  simple  linear  model  (LM),  b)  a 
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and c) an 
artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset contained 89 valid records 
(outliers were removed according to the empirical rule), while one re-
cord represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on 
one  leaf.  For  the  purpose  of  SPAD  value  modelling,  the  dataset  was 
divided  into  a  “training  dataset”  containing  60  randomly  selected  re-
cords and a “testing dataset” that contained the remaining 29 records. 
All three models were then fitted using the “training dataset” and further 
validated using the “testing dataset”.

applied to provide wide nutrient diversity of plant material. To achieve a 
low nutrient substrate, garden soil was mixed with sand in a 1:1 ratio. 
After seed germination and seedling selection, rapeseed was planted in 
pure substrate for three weeks to provide equal initial nutrient uptake 
within all 50 pots. This ensured the ideal conditions for the following

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not contain information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any mention of random seeds. Therefore, it is impossible to provide an accurate response based solely on this context. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed random seeds, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization or data splits.
