Table C.2

Surface area as a share of each bioregion (ID) for every SRI category for each of the three grid sizes (R1= ∼ 1
). Values show the surface area as 
a share of each bioregion for every SRI category (see §2.2.1). ID is the identification number given to each bioregion (Table 1). H are cells with a high representativeness 
of species richness (i.e. SRI > 0.85). M are cells considered as having a medium representativeness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0.60, 0.85)). L cells are cells with a low number of records 
and are thus not considered to be representative of actual species richness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0, 0.6)). NR as cells with no records (SRI = NA), and IR as cell with insufficient 
records to apply SRI.

◦ = 958 cells). Table C.2 contains 
the results of this analysis for these grids. We have also mapped these results (see Fig. A.3), to understand how the effect of spatial resolution on the 
◦
evaluation of biodiversity macropatterns. Finally, we also plot the frequency of cells for each SRI category for the three grid sizes (R1= ∼ 1
; 
R10= ∼ 10

) to understand how the data is distributed in our analyses (see Fig. A.4).

Table 3 
Results  from  overlapping  FAO  fishery  areas  and  SRI  grid.  The  surface  area 
corresponding to each bioregion, and the share of surface area of each classifi-
cation. Areas are in thousands square km; NR is the share of cells with No Re-
cords; IR is the share of cells with Insufficient Records; L is the share of classified 
cells with low number of records; M is the share of classified cells with medium 
number of records, and H is the share of cells with a high number of records. The 
largest values for each column are highlighted.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search.
