P = 100 or P = 80, G = 100, and setting the minimum fitness value as 7 
according to the specific situation of this study, is shown in Fig. 7a. The 
obtained ecological source using P = 60 or P = 50 and G = 100, and 
setting the minimum fitness value to 10 according to the specific situ-
ation of this study and based on the results obtained in the previous step 
is shown in Fig. 7b. Finally, the obtained ecological source using P = 30 
or P = 20 and G = 100, and setting the minimum fitness value as 15 
according to the specific situation and based on the results obtained in 
the previous step is shown in Fig. 7c. Different “initial population” and 
different minimum fitness values were set for each result. Therefore, the 
ESA resulted in these three cases were used in the result analysis. By 
calculating the source coverage area, source coverage rate, source con-
nectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC, it was found that when

P  = 50, the  ESA was  the  best, the  connectivity  rate of  the  ecological 
source  was  84.99%,  the  IIC  value  was  0.81,  the  ecological  source 
coverage  rate was  the highest, and  the fragmentation index  was low. 
Therefore, the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help us understand how well our model has learned from the data and how accurately it can predict new instances.

2. Visualization: Visualizing the output of the model can provide insights into its behavior and help identify any potential issues. For example, saliency maps can highlight which parts of the input image had the most significant impact on the final prediction. Similarly, confusion matrices can show the distribution of predicted vs actual classes and help identify any class imbalance problems.

3. Hyperparameter tuning: After evaluating the initial model, we may want to fine-tune some hyperparameters to improve its performance further. This could involve adjusting learning rates, regularization parameters, batch sizes, etc., and retraining the model with different combinations of hyperparameters until we find the optimal configuration.

4. Ensemble modeling: In some cases, combining multiple models together can lead to better overall performance than relying on a single model alone. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be employed to create ensembles of models and leverage their strengths collectively.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated various indices related to ecosystem service assessment (ESA), including source coverage area, source coverage rate, source connectivity rate, fragmentation index, Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC), and Proximity Coefficient (PC). They also mention using different "initial populations" and minimum fitness values for each result, suggesting that they may have applied optimization techniques during the postprocessing stage. However, without more information about the specific algorithms and tools used, it is difficult to determine exactly what postprocessing steps were taken beyond those mentioned above.
