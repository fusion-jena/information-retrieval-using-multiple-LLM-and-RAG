diverse datasets. This includes addressing issues such as class imbalance 
and sampling bias.

vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

methods have shown significant advancements when applied to large 
datasets, often outperforming traditional machine learning techniques 
in various fields (Brown et al., 2020; Christin et al., 2019; Jumper et al., 
2021; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). A distinctive advantage of deep learning 
approaches lies in their inherent flexibility, enabling the simultaneous 
integration of diverse data types and the modeling of multiple species, a 
capability  that  is  increasingly  vital  in  ecological  research.  Recent 
research emphasizes the potential of deep learning methods in SDMs, 
showing performance that matches or exceeds traditional techniques. In 
particular, this improvement seems to extend to both presence-absence 
(Chen et al., 2016; Teng et al., 2023) and presence-only datasets (Botella 
et al., 2023; Deneu et al., 2021).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the references to diverse datasets and the use of remote sensing in the Geolifeclef 2023 challenge that various sources may be employed. These could include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, Botella et al. (2023) discuss the use of high spatial resolution remote sensing data for predicting species composition at continental scales. Similarly, Brown et al. (2020) highlight the application of deep learning methods on large datasets, which could potentially encompass publicly available information. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the collection process, it remains speculative to pinpoint exact methods for gathering raw data within the described deep learning framework.
