RESULTS 

The training process took around 10 hours on 
the  CPU.  The  accuracy  obtained  reaches 
95%  on  140  epochs.  We  first  measure  the 
performance  of  the  proposed  model  fig  6. 
and then compared it with the state-of-the-art 
approaches to justify its performance.

Experiment  show  that  the  proposed  CNN-
LSTM  performs  better  in  classifying  plant 
species  than  the  convectional  CNN  as  it 
attains  the  accuracy  of  95.06%  while  the 
literatures (Zhang et al. 2019) have reported 
only 91% accuracy. 

Performance Evaluation

containing  64  different  element  vectors  of 
plants in a set of 100 distinct classes of plant 
species.  Several  state-of  the-  art  model 
architectures were trained, with the proposed 
model  attaining  performance  of  95.06% 
success rate in identifying the corresponding 
plant  species.  The  significant  success  rate 
makes the model very useful identifier or/and 
advisory tool. The approach could be further 
expanded  to  support  an  integrated  plant 
species  identification  system  to  operate  in 
real ecosystem services.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. None of the sources mention any specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on this context.
