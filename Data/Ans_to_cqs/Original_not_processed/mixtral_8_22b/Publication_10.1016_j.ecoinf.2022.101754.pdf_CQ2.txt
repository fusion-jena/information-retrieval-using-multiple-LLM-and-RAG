Preprocessed  ALS  data  (see  Section  2.3)  were  combined  with  the 

field data and further processed as follows:  

1.  Cylindrical plot design. Based upon coordinates of the center of each 
field plot, a circular buffer of 500 m2 is taken and a subsection of the 
point cloud is cut out.  

2.  Lidar data thinning. Cloud density is unified based on the number of 
the first returns per plot. We worked with four point density levels: 
2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 points per m2 (Fig. 4). That was achieved by a 
random selection of 1250, 2500, 3750, and 5000 points from each 
cloud subsection. More precisely, these point counts were weighted 
by  a  ratio  of  first  return  versus  all  returns  to  simulate  a  uniform 
density of emitted laser pulses. 

3. Descriptive  statistics  calculation.  Using  data  from  each  cloud  sub-
section  with  a  unified  density,  the  following  descriptive  statistics 
(hereinafter referred to as predictors) were calculated:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and Landsat 8 satellite imagery. These datasets are typically available in various formats such as raster or vector files, which can then be preprocessed into suitable formats like arrays or matrices before being fed into the deep learning model. Additionally, field data is also mentioned, but its exact nature is not specified. It could potentially include measurements stored in structured formats like CSV or Excel files. Therefore, while the precise data formats cannot be determined solely from the provided context, it can be assumed that they involve spatial data formats like raster or vector files along with possibly other structured data formats.
