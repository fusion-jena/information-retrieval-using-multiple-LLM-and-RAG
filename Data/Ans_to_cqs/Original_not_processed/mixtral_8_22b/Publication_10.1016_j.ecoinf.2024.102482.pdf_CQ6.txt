2.4.4. System structure 

We endeavored to design the model structure as simple as possible to 
ensure its usability on devices with limited computing power and enable 
real-time predictions, as long as the performance was not significantly 
reduced. Our aim was to create a model that balances performance and 
efficiency.  The  selected  system's  structure  consists  of  an  input  layer, 
three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. In the 
case of binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, 
and σ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more 
than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs and the softmax 
function is used as the activation function. The overall structure of the 
model is depicted in Fig. 5.

challenging.  This  difficulty  may  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  bio-
monitoring systems, unlike water quality analysis studies, require sig-
nificant  time  and  effort  to  collect  data  for  training.  As  a  result,  the 
integration  of  deep  learning  into  biomonitoring  for  water  quality 
pollution detection is an area that has yet to see widespread exploration. 
Nevertheless, despite these challenges, recent developments in various 
fields  of  ecology  have  demonstrated  high  performance  in  time-series 
data  analysis  using  the  LSTM  model,  a  type  of  DRNN  model  (Con-
cepcion et al., 2023; Dehghani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; O'Donncha 
et  al.,  2022;  Zhang  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  study,  we  showed  that  the 
performance of a biomonitoring system using time-series data, such as 
the swimming behavior of C. elegans, can be significantly improved by 
introducing  the  LSTM  model.  It  showed  a  high  detection  accuracy  of

The features used as input vectors of the learning significantly impact 
the performance of machine learning-based systems. The limited set of 
patterns used as features in the paper is what the HMM requires, not 
specific characteristics, as needed for LSTM. Using a finite number of 
patterns  has  the  advantage  of  facilitating  the  analysis  of  C.  elegans 
response behavior using statistical analysis or metrics like Levenshtein 
distance  (Kang  et  al.,  2012).  However,  this  clustering  step  inevitably 
leads to information loss, which may result in performance degradation 
of water quality assessment methods. Conversely, the proposed LSTM- 
based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, and 
it can be expected to achieve relatively higher accuracy because it uses a 
larger  feature  domain.  Additionally,  computational  measures  such  as 
BLS entropy have limitations in capturing important information found

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the model performs optimally. These steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or redundant data from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the data.

2. Normalization or Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range. This is because different features might have different scales, and thus, their magnitudes could influence the learning process. Common techniques for normalization include Min-Max scaling, where all values are transformed to lie between 0 and 1, and Standardization, where each value is subtracted by the mean and divided by the standard deviation.

3. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to the prediction task. Therefore, selecting relevant features can improve the model’s performance and reduce overfitting. Techniques for feature selection include correlation matrix, mutual information, chi-square test, etc.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models work best with numerical inputs. Hence, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. One popular technique is one-hot encoding, where each category is represented as a new column filled with zeros except for a '1' in the row corresponding to the category.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training, the dataset is usually split into three parts - training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.
