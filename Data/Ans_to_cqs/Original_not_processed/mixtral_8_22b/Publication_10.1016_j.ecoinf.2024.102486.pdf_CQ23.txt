computation. The first was in 2016 (Mill´an et al., 2016), and thereafter 
the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine 
learning  where  the  training  phase  can  readily  be  parallelised  and 
accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose. 
(A review of machine learning in ecology is given by Pichler and Hartig, 
2022.) Typical machine learning applications involved recognition and 
classification  of  visual  images  (e.g.  Atila  et  al.,  2021)  or  acoustic  re-
cordings (e.g. Nanni et al., 2020). The most used software tools were 
those  that  provide  accessible  extensions  to  the  Python  programming 
language, such as TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015), Keras (Chollet et al., 
2015), and PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), although alternatives using

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions several relevant concepts related to machine learning and deep learning, including GPU computation, parallel processing, and popular software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. It also discusses typical machine learning applications involving image and sound recognition and classification. To improve the generalizability of a deep learning model, one could consider employing diverse datasets, cross-validation techniques, stratified sampling methods, or other strategies aimed at reducing overfitting and increasing robustness.
