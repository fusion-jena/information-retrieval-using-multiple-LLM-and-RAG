parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

(Hudak et al., 2020). This strategic sampling technique was chosen to 
capture  the  full  distribution  of  AGB  values  within  the  LiDAR-derived 
AGB  maps  accurately.  This  stratified  random  sampling  approach  was 
chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented 
the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The 
use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-
ated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values

reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task. 
The  winning  parameters  are  as  follows:  numberOfTrees:  150,  min-
LeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the data splitting strategy employed for the machine learning model is not explicitly mentioned as being specifically for a deep learning model. However, the information does provide details about how the data was divided into training and testing sets.

A stratified random sampling approach was used to capture the full distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived AGB maps accurately. In this approach, a randomly selected half of the pixels were used for the training and testing split. This ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps.

Additionally, a random number seed was used to ensure reproducibility, and multiple seeds were evaluated to select the one that provides the most stable and reliable results. Cross-validation techniques were also employed during the grid search process to evaluate the model's performance.

However, there is no explicit mention of a separate validation set or any specific criteria used to create such a set. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it can be concluded that the data was primarily split into training and testing sets using a stratified random sampling approach, with a focus on maintaining the distribution of AGB values across both sets.
