%Query
Query: "What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be assumed that common strategies such as cross-validation or validation set evaluation might have been employed based on standard practices in machine learning research.

Unhelpful Answer:
I do not know what strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training since this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
