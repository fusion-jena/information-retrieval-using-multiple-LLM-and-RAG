their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

The study of bird populations is crucial for biodiversity research and conservation. Deep artificial neural net-
works  have  revolutionized  bird  acoustic  recognition;  however,  most  methods  overlook  inherent  relationships 
among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. To address this limitation, we propose the 
Phylogenetic  Perspective  Neural  Network  (PPNN),  which  incorporates  hierarchical  multilevel  labels  for  each 
bird. PPNN uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels. 
Attention  mechanisms  are  employed  to  extract  and  select  common  and  distinguishing  features,  thereby 
improving classification accuracy. We also propose a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions. 
Experimental results on bird acoustic datasets demonstrate that PPNN outperforms current methods, achieving

the  two  datasets  using  the  “stratified  sampling”  method.  We  selected 
birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018, abbreviated as “BC-S" 
(BirdCLEF-Small)  and  “BC-L"  (BirdCLEF-Large).  From  the  Lishui- 
Zhejiang Birdsdata, we chose 100 bird species, referred to as “LS”. We 
then halved the number of training samples of each species for “LS” to 
construct  a  supplementary  small-scale  training  set,  denoted  as  “LS*”. 
The datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 
10% for validation, and 10% for testing to compare the experimental 
results. Detailed statistical information is presented in Table 3.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the provided text mentions any specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the given context.
