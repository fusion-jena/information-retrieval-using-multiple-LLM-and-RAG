model for extracting the embeddings. 

These are pulled from YAMNet and then fed as input to a sequential 
and  a  reduce  mean  layer  mapping  to  the  classes  mentioned  above 
(Ntalampiras et al., 2021). At this point, the final layers of the network 
map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels as shown in Fig. 5.

The  dataset  presented  in  Section  3.2  was  divided  into  70%  for 
training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. The division 
was  kept  the  same  when  experimenting  with  RF  and  YAMNet-based

3.2.2. Transfer learning based on YAMNet 

The second algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a 
deep neural network, i.e. YAMNet, which is pre-trained on data coming 
from 521 classes. Interestingly, YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convo-
lution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus (Shor 
et  al.,  2020).  Towards  using  YAMNet,  the  audio  data  is  processed  as 
follows:  

1.  The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 

16 kHz.  

2.  The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 

25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.  

3.  The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel 

scale within the range of 125–7500 Hz.  

4.  Finally, the algorithm is applied and its outcome is passed to YAMNet 

model for extracting the embeddings.

table); it is reconstructed based on the start times and durations of both 
entities. A particular scenario is that of event instances whose duration is 
very short (impulsive events, duration d ≈ 0s) or impossible to detect 
(unknown events, duration d = (cid:0) 1). In these cases, the event is auto-
matically associated with all the audio files that cover its start time.

Therefore, the recording campaign was planned to last an entire year so 
as  to  capture  the  variations  that  goat  vocalizations  demonstrate 
throughout  the  year.  Overall,  we  have  collected  approximately  10  M 
sound  events  lasting  more  than  34,000  h.  Fig.  7  illustrates  the  data 
distribution per farm in terms of number of audio files, annotations and 
durations.
