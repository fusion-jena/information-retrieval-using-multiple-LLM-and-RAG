learner was trained on a slightly different subset generated by resam-
pling (i.e., bootstrapping). Training on varied subsets can change the
model parameter values of the weak learners, enhancing the diversity of
learners within the homogeneous ensemble. Among the ensemble
models, weighted soft voting obtained low biases and variances across
all taxa, thus minimizing the loss in all three RHIs. The high generaliz-
ability of weighted soft voting might be conferred by the probabilistic
representations from each individual base model. Unlike binary classi-
fications, probabilistic representations allow weighted soft voting to
account for the confidence and uncertainty in the prediction of each base
model (Taha, 2021). In contrast, the single models exhibited low
generalizability with either high bias or high variance, indicating an
underfitting or overfitting tendency depending on the model

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform various preprocessing techniques on datasets before feeding them into a model. These may include:

1. Normalization: This involves transforming the dataset so that its features have zero mean and unit variance. It helps in stabilizing the learning process and improving convergence rates during optimization. Common methods used for normalization include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.

2. Scaling: Scaling refers to adjusting the range of independent variables or features in a dataset to improve the performance of the model. Techniques like standardization and normalization help bring all features to the same level of magnitude, which can significantly impact the results when using distance-based measures or gradient descent-based optimizers.

3. Cleaning: Dataset cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and dealing with inconsistent entries. Missing values can be replaced with statistical measures like mean, median, mode, or imputation techniques. Outliers can be detected using visualizations or statistical tests and removed if necessary. Consistent entries ensure that the dataset maintains integrity and reliability.

While these preprocessing steps are commonly applied, they depend heavily on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the specific deep learning task. Therefore, it is essential to understand the characteristics of the dataset and choose appropriate preprocessing techniques accordingly.
