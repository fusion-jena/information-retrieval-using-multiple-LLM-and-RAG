spectrometer Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that measures 
solar  radiation  reflected  by  the  Earth  in  21  spectral  bands  at  spatial 
resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on 
these Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same 
world  region  around  the  same  hour  (see  Table  2)  and  having  a  high 
temporal  resolution  is  essential  for  the  development  of  a  monitoring 
system.

The  landscape  of  aquatic  environmental  monitoring  has  been 
notably transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with 
satellite data interpretation. Pioneering studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim 
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a significant leap in refining 
the  precision  of  satellite-derived  analytical  processes,  particularly  for 
the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al., 2022) have 
spearheaded  the  development of  sophisticated algorithms  tailored for 
atmospheric  correction,  optimized  for  application  with  data  from  the 
Sentinel-3 satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demon-
strate marked efficacy in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations 
within the optically complex waters of shallow lakes.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models mentioned in the text. However, considering the general practices in evaluating deep learning models, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance, including its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances, balance between false positives and negatives, and overall correct predictions. Given the focus of the study on estimating Chl-a concentrations using ML techniques, it can be assumed that similar evaluation methods might have been employed. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which exact metrics were utilized.
