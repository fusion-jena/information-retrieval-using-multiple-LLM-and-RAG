of a plethora of runs with different number of trees (Probst et al., 2019). 
For  the  best  split  selection  measurement,  the  Gini  Index  was  used 
(Breiman,  2001).  The  number  of  variables  used  for  each  node  (mtry) 
were  automatically  selected  by  using  repeated  cross  validations  per-
formed  with  10  folds  and  10  repetitions  for  the  seagrass  meadow 
models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow 
models. The available validation dataset was used to create a confusion 
matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, metrics 
as  overall  (O.A.),  producer  (P.A.)  and  user  (U.A.)  accuracy  for  each 
classified class were calculated (Congalton, 1991). O.A. represents the 
proportion  of  correctly  classified  validation  samples  (found along  the 
diagonal in the error matrix) to the total number of validation samples, 
irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately clas-

Helpful Answer:
The statistical analysis section describes the use of random forest classification for mapping seagrass meadows and species meadows. To evaluate the performance of this model, several metrics are employed based on the confusion matrix generated from the validation dataset. These metrics include Overall Accuracy (O.A.), Producer Accuracy (P.A.), and User Accuracy (U.A.).

O.A. measures the proportion of correctly classified validation samples to the total number of validation samples, regardless of class. This metric provides an overall assessment of the model's performance across all classes.

P.A., also known as sensitivity or recall, calculates the proportion of true positives (correctly identified instances of a particular class) out of the actual positive cases (total instances of that class). In other words, it indicates how well the model can identify instances belonging to a specific class.

U.A., also referred to as precision, determines the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positive cases (both true and false positives). It reflects the reliability of the model's predictions for a given class.

These three metrics—O.A., P.A., and U.A.—are presented in Table 2 for both seagrass meadows and species meadows mapping, covering various years such as 2003, 2007, 2010*, and 2019. Each row in the table corresponds to a specific year and type of meadow, displaying the respective values for O.A., U.A., and P.A.
