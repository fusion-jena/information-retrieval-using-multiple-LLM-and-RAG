2.2. Observation content and methods

In order to ensure a similar process between the two methods, the 
same subset data were used to apply an RF. Before running the model, it 
was necessary to define two basic parameters in advance: the number of 
variables to try (M), and the number of trees to run (Nt), at each split. 
The parameter M was found through the internal RF function TuneRF, 
which  calculates  the  optimal  number  of  variables  starting  from  the 
default  value  and  finds  the  value  with  the  minimum  OOB  error  rate 
below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number 
of  variables  for  regression).  The  function  looks  below  and  above  this 
threshold for the value with the minimum OOB error rate. Typically, the 
value  of  M  in  the  RF  model  is  largely  based  on  empirical  formula. 
However, in this study, the alternate method of successive screening was 
used to determine the optimal parameter M, which attempts to take all

Future research should consider the changes of predictors at different 
spatial and temporal scales in order to better evaluate the explanatory 
power  of  independent  variables  in  different  climate  regions.  Such 
knowledge could then be applied to other climate region types to un-
derstand the importance level of climate region differences to selected 
variables and the overall prediction ability of the model. In addition, the 
observation  index  can  be  increased,  the  observation  time  can  be 
extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree spe-
cies can be strengthened. Big data theory and technology, neural net-
works, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods 
are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on 
selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models, 
so as to comprehensively and systematically understand the influence of 
forest microclimate on NAI.

remaining sample data was called the out-of-bag predictions (known as 
OOB), which were used to evaluate the overall error of the model and 
the  importance  of  variables.  If  Xj  is  one  of  the  input  variables,  when 
calculating the importance of variable Xj in the N-th tree VIn, we first use 
the sample data of bootstrap sampling to establish the regression tree 
model  Tn,  calculate  the  prediction  error  of  OOB,  and  then  randomly 
replace the observation value of variable Xj. The regression tree model 
Tn’ is established again to calculate the prediction error of OOB’ (out-of- 
bag predictions after random displacement variable observation). After 
the difference in prediction error of the two OOB data is standardized, 
the mean value of all regression tree results is the importance of variable 
Xj  in  the  N-th  tree  VIn(Xj)  (Delgado  et  al., 2016),  and  the  calculation

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some general principles related to handling data bias can still be observed.

One technique mentioned is using the same subset data for applying Random Forests (RF) to ensure a similar process between two methods. This approach helps maintain consistency and avoid potential biases introduced by using different subsets of data.

Additionally, the context discusses determining the optimal number of variables (M) using the internal RF function TuneRF, which calculates the optimal number of variables with the minimum Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate. By minimizing the OOB error rate, this method aims to reduce the impact of noise or irrelevant features in the dataset, thus addressing potential sources of bias.

Furthermore, the text suggests increasing the observation index, extending the observation time, and strengthening the joint observation of multi-regions and multi-tree species. These recommendations imply collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets, which can help mitigate biases caused by limited or skewed data representation.

Lastly, the context mentions applying big data theory, neural networks, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods to understand the importance level of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. While not explicitly stated, these advanced analytical techniques may also contribute to identifying and reducing biases within the data.
