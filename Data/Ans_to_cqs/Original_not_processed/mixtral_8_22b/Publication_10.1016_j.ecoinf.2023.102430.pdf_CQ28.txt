specimens,  our  species-level  coverage  was  still  limited;  therefore,  we 
focus on algorithm performance at the genus level, for which we were 
able  to  gather  large  enough  samples  of  specimens  and  pictures.  We 
follow  the  currently  accepted  systematic  arrangement  for  the  Tri-
atominae (Monteiro et al., 2018), with all our bugs falling into one of the 
three genera to which the main vectors of human Chagas disease, from 
the USA to Argentina, all belong – Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius 
(WHO,  2002).  Our  assessment  shows  that  convolutional  neural  net-
works can identify these major triatomine genera with very high accu-
racy  using  low-resolution  pictures  taken  with  ordinary  cellphone 
cameras, irrespective of the angles or positions at which the bugs were 
photographed.  This  result  paves  the  way  for  ‘hybrid’  entomological 
surveillance systems  combining  human  taxonomic expertise  with  ma-

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not mention any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform where a deep learning model has been deployed. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based solely on this information.
