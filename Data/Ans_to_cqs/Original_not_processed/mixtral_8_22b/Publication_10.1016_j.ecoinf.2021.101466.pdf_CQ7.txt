these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

To re-identify the candidate regions, we inputted outputs from the 
YOLOv4  into  the  EfficientNet.  As  mentioned  above,  there  were  eight 
types of the EfficientNet. Starting from the baseline EfficientNet-B0, the 
baseline network was scaled up from EfficientNet-B1 to B7 based on the

capacity  over  various  benchmark  datasets  by  adopting  a  compound 
scaling method that enlarges the network depth, width, and resolution. 
In  addition,  we  proposed  a  data  augmentation  method  to  train  the 
two-stage CNNs as a generally applicable model under various camera or 
field conditions.

Helpful Answer:
The data was split into training and validation sets using an 80/20 ratio. This means that 80% of the 4000 images per category were used for training the EfficientNet model, while the remaining 20% were used for validation purposes. The splitting process is not explicitly stated to be random, but it can be assumed that the data was randomly divided to ensure fairness and prevent any bias towards certain types of images during training. No specific mention of a separate test set was made, suggesting that the validation set might have been used for both validating the model during training and testing its performance after training. However, without explicit information about the use of a separate test set, it cannot be definitively confirmed.
