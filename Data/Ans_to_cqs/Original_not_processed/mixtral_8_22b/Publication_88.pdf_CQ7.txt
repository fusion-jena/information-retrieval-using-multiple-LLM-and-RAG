The EF network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers (Conv) including the
Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), two Max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two Fully Connected layers
(FC), with a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to “deforestation” and
“no-deforestation” classes. The ﬁlter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

2.6. Inﬂuence of the Number of Training Samples

To evaluate the inﬂuence of the number of training samples, four scenarios were considered.
Speciﬁcally collecting samples from the training set of a one, two, three and four tiles, denoted as Ni,
where i corresponds to the number of tiles used in each scenario. For EF and SN methods, the validation
set (val) was used to stop training once the loss increased in 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping).
As mentioned before, for CSVM and SVM the samples in this set were added to the training set (tr).
The number of training samples in each scenario for the Amazon and Cerrado databases is presented
in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

For training the EF and SN models, we selected the following setup empirically: batch size equal
to 32 with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the
validation set) and a dropout rate of 0.2 in the ﬁnal FC layer. Additionally, Adam optimizer was
selected empirically with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10−3. As loss function,
we used the binary cross-entropy.

second metric is the Recall deﬁned in Equation (4).

Helpful Answer:
The data was split into training, validation, and test sets for both the Amazon and Cerrado databases. However, the specific criteria used to split the data are not explicitly stated in the given context. It can be inferred that the splitting was done based on different tiles or regions, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Each table lists the available deforestation and non-deforestation samples for various tiles in the respective datasets. Furthermore, it appears that the number of training samples was varied across multiple scenarios, ranging from using one tile to four tiles for training purposes. This suggests that the dataset was divided based on spatial distribution rather than random sampling.
