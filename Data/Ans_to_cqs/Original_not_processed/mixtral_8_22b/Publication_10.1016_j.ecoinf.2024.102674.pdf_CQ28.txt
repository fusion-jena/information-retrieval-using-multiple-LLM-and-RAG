%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide information about which specific cloud computing platforms were used to deploy their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they used Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based solely on these sources. To find this information, one would need to consult additional resources such as technical reports, conference proceedings, or direct communication with the authors.
