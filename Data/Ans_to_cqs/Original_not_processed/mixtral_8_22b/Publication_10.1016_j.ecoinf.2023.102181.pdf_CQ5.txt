Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model.

training  (i.e.,  bagging),  then  to  obtain  unbiased  estimates  of  model 
performance  without  omitting  portions  of  the  feature  space  during 
validation. An important note is that the latter procedure also enables 
leveraging of spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction. 
Bagging normally proceeds by drawing many bootstrap samples of 
the data and training models on each, which are aggregated to form an 
ensemble predictor (Breiman, 1996). Individual data points each have 
probability P(si) = 1
n  of being selected during a single draw of a single 
bootstrap sample, where si  is one of n data points distributed over the 
study  area.  Non-independent  data  observations  can  be  considered  as 
partial replication of some information in the modelling dataset. In an 
extreme example, consider two data points at the same location with 
exactly the same environmental measurements. We could conceptualize

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on research papers related to machine learning applications in geology and soil science. These studies use different types of data, including soil class predictions in semi-arid landscapes, sampling methods for validating digital soil maps, supervised and unsupervised classification techniques for marine benthic habitat mapping, and covariance-weighted bagging for reducing bias in machine learning models with clustered data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
