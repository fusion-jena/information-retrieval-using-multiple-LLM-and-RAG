Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that a subset of the data was used for training the models, while the rest was used for testing. It also states that the dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites. Therefore, we can infer that random selection might have been one of the criteria used to split the data. Additionally, the context suggests that the authors used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning techniques for their analysis, which typically require splitting the data into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. In general, common practices include using a larger portion of the data for training, a smaller portion for validation during the training process, and another small portion for final testing after the model has been trained.
