The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity. 

CRediT authorship contribution statement

As with any other type of remotely sensed data and image analysis 
approach, there are challenges in this study that need to be taken into 
consideration  with  the  interpretation  of  the  results.  The  biggest chal-
lenge was working with a mosaic of historical B&W aerial images from 
different years together with compiling the training/validation dataset 
for large-area, high spatial resolution aerial images. Therefore, it was 
essential  to  build  an  easy  and  efficient  sampling  strategy  and  export 
methodology. GEE played a significant role in this process, as it allowed 
different  independent  operators  to  collect  training  and  test  samples 
using a cloud-based server to run the analyses which minimized large 
data  management  and  storage.  Furthermore,  as  mentioned  in  Section 
2.4, photojob 155 (1940) was the aerial image with the highest number 
of  visible  artifacts  (i.e.,  dark  round  green  circles)  and  this  can  be

4. Discussion 

The historical aerial images covering KNP provided an opportunity 
to apply OBIA to a large dataset (approx. 1.7 million ha) and to create a 
methodology  tailored  to  classify  land  cover  of  B&W  historical  photo-
graphs.  This  methodology  was  an  iterative  process  built  on  previous 
studies in the field (Eckhardt et al., 2000; Fensham and Fairfax, 2002; 
Hay and Castilla, 2008; Tassi and Vizzari, 2020; Vogels et al., 2017) and 
on new site-specific methods. We first developed a supervised learning 
workflow in GEE that detects woody cover from B&W images and then 
conceptualized  an  efficient  training/validation  sampling  strategy  that 
was  applied to create  the first historical woody cover map of  KNP in 
1939–1944.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Google Earth Engine (GEE) played a significant role in building an easy and efficient sampling strategy and export methodology. It also allowed different independent operators to collect training and test samples using a cloud-based server to run the analyses. From this information, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform since GEE is a part of the Google ecosystem. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.
