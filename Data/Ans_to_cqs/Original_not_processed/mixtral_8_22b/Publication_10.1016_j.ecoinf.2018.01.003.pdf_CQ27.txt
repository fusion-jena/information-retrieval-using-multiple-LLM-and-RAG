and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

model which is widely used in the neural network and the SVM model
which can make up for the shortage of the neural network is conducted
to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking the ad-
vantages of both.

tolerance of 0, and the least allowable gradient as 1e-5 (Fig. 5). The
experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6).

Data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. The network
ﬁnally converges after 50–100 iterations (repeated experiments) using
5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. The results predict
the 2014 total EF of Beijing to be 8726 ten thousand acres with an error
of 2% and a standard deviation of 1082, compared to the actual value of

8874 ten thousand acres. The 2015 value is predicted to be 8743 ten
thousand acres with an error of 3%, a standard deviation of 1193 and a
root mean square error (RMSE) of 121.65, compared to the actual value
of 8984 ten thousand acres. (Table 2).

Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6). This suggests that the experiment might have been carried out within the Matlab environment itself. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment.
