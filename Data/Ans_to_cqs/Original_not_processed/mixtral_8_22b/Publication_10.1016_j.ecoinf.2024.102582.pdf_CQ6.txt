(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions some general steps taken during the process of creating training samples and extracting landscape types.

In the given context, the researchers generated 1800 sample points in the study area's image for each year, with 300 sample points for each land cover type. They imported these sample points into the Google Earth Engine (GEE) application programming interface (API) for further analysis. Then, they divided these samples into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. Finally, they applied the random forest algorithm to quickly classify the land use types in the study area.

Additionally, post-classification processing was performed on the images. Manual visual interpretation was employed to rectify the image classification outcomes for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone stretching inland from the coastline. This method effectively addressed misclassifications between forests and mangroves due to spectral confusion.

Although these steps do not directly correspond to typical preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, they demonstrate essential stages in preparing data for training a deep learning model. These include generating sample points, importing them into an API, dividing them into training and validation sets, applying algorithms for classification, and manually refining the results when necessary.
