found that a model trained on images of one of the two bright-
ﬁeld channels (i.e. channels 1 and 9) performed best in terms of
accuracy with a species-averaged accuracy of 95% and 94%,
respectively. Species-averaged accuracy means that we ﬁrst deter-
mine the accuracy per species, before averaging across all species.
In this way we prevent dominant classes in an unbalanced dataset
like ours, that is, some species occur more often than others, to
also dominate the overall performance measure. We also found
that a model trained on a combination of one brightﬁeld channel
(channel 9) and two ﬂuorescence channels (channels 2 and 7)
performed best overall with a species-averaged accuracy of 96%
and an F-measure of 0.96.

Classiﬁer evaluation For the evaluation of the classiﬁer results,
different parameters were determined. The classiﬁcation rate or
accuracy for a species is given by the relation:
TP þ TN
TP þ TN þ FP þ FN

Accuracy ¼

where TP (true positive rate) indicates accurate positive identiﬁ-
cations (e.g. pollen species x is identiﬁed correctly as pollen
species x) are correctly predicted (pollen x), TN (true negative
rate) indicates accurate negative identiﬁcations (e.g. pollen species
y is identiﬁed correctly as not being pollen species x), FP (false
positive rate) indicates that the observation is different but pre-
dicted as true (e.g. pollen species y is identiﬁed to be pollen
species x), and FN (false negative rate) indicates that a true obser-
vation is predicted to be different (e.g. pollen species x is identi-
ﬁed to not be pollen species x). As accuracy counts all kinds of
errors with the same costs, it is important to consider other more
detailed parameters in addition:

Higher values of per-channel accuracy and F-measure indicate better
performance and vice versa.

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. This learning rate is then exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. The model's performance is evaluated based on its classification rate or accuracy for each species, which is calculated using the formula: TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN). Here, TP refers to true positives, TN to true negatives, FP to false positives, and FN to false negatives. Additionally, the model's performance is assessed using per-channel accuracy and F-measure, where higher values indicate better performance.
