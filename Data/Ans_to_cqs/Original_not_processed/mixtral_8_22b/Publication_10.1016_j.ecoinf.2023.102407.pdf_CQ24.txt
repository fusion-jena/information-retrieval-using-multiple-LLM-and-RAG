learning  (ML)-based  methods  have  been 
employed for more accurate species distribution predictions (Rew et al., 
2020;  Saranya  et  al.,  2021).  Due  to  their  ability  to  capture  complex 
spatial patterns, they exhibit superior predictive performance compared 
with traditional methods. For instance, Bellin et al. (2022) showed that 
an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer outperforms 
GLM  in  their  distribution  prediction  experiments  using  27  environ-
mental variables for two zooplankton species. In addition, several well- 
known ML methods, including the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method 
(Phillips  et  al.,  2006),  and  various  ensemble  models  such  as  random 
forest  (RF)  (Ahmed  et  al.,  2021),  gradient  boosting  machine  (GBM) 
(Marmion et al., 2009), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) (Effrosynidis 
et  al.,  2020),  and  light  GBM  (LGBM)  (Effrosynidis  and  Arampatzis,

Helpful Answer:
The context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to set a fixed random seed value before training or testing a model to ensure reproducibility of results. This allows researchers to compare different algorithms or hyperparameters under identical conditions. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, where data is split into multiple subsets for training and validation, help mitigate the effects of randomness by averaging over multiple runs with different splits. The context mentions using 10% and 30% of the remaining dataset as validation and test sets, which could be part of a cross-validation strategy.
