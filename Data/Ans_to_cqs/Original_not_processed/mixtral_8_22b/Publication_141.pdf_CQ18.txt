Fig. 3. Morphological characters of the training set used by the classiﬁer in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily level of taxonomic identiﬁcation. Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps with the relevant characters for each of the three models (red = most important region for classiﬁcation). The
percentages indicate proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classiﬁcation in the training set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

factors: network architecture, protocol type of image acquisition
(Martineau et al., 2017), and robustness of input matrix (number
of entities and replicates). Our choice to use a ResNet-50 network
architecture, in combination with transfer learning, data augmen-
tation, and dropout proved appropriate for the current number of
taxa in our demonstration dataset. ResNet-50 network architecture
represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette (18, 34, 50, 101,
152 layers) that combines both representation power and lower
complexity that allows relatively fast training of the models. How-
ever, the protocol for image acquisition inﬂuences the complexity
of features, which will be processed by CNNs. Controlled object
position during the collection of images can also govern the level
of feature variability. Our dataset was constructed under the lab-
based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position
of the larvae (ventral point of view). This was not the case in pre-

character but this was taxon-dependent- and with low number
of cases in the training set (Fig. 3).

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions several techniques used to improve the model's accuracy, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout. These methods are commonly employed to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Additionally, the text discusses the use of a ResNet-50 network architecture, which has been proven effective for handling complex datasets like the one presented here. It also highlights the importance of the image acquisition protocol and its impact on the model's ability to process features accurately. Lastly, the text presents various metrics related to misclassified images and accuracy rates for different stages of the training process, suggesting that these indicators were likely used to evaluate the model's performance.
