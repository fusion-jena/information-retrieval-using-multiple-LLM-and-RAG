4.1. Evaluation of fusion quality 

(1)  The  feature  dataset,  training  samples,  and  validation  samples 
were used as input into five base models to generate prediction 
results  (TKNN,  TRF,  TAdaBoost,  TXGBoost,  TLightGBM)  of  the  training 
samples  and  prediction  results  (VKNN,  VRF,  VAdaBoost,  VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM) of the validation samples.  

(2)  TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM  were combined in a 
column manner to obtain T, and VKNN, VRF, VAdaBoost, VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM were combined in a column manner to obtain V.  
(3)  Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the 
RF  algorithm  was  used  to  generate  the  prediction  results 
(α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of  training  data  T  by  5-fold  cross-validation.

pruning  is  repeated  recursively  until  the  cross-validation  accu-

This study used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation 
(RFECV) to select the optimal features that could reduce the redundancy

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to the data. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical data to a similar range, which helps prevent variables with larger ranges from dominating those with smaller ranges during model training. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling, StandardScaler, and RobustScaler.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models typically work better with numeric inputs rather than categorical ones. Therefore, it might be necessary to convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.

4. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features can help improve model performance and efficiency. Techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV) can be employed to identify important features.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, various transformations can be applied to existing images, including rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc.

In this specific case, the authors have mentioned using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV) for selecting optimal features. However, they did not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps like data cleaning, normalization, or encoding categorical variables.
