Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

5.2. Deep learning with Ppf-CM

achieved with Ppf-CM based SAE method, suggesting SAE beneﬁted
more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages
using Ppf-CM (Table 4). This was mainly because, compared to the
traditional machine learning method (SVM), deep learning method
(SAE) can easily capture and exploit more complex information with its
deep network structure and strong self-learning ability (Penatti et al.,
2015; Xie et al., 2015).

This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, generally, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling techniques to maintain class balance. In some cases, time series datasets may be divided chronologically, where earlier data is used for training and later data for testing/validation. It is also important to note that the proportion of data allocated to each set depends on factors such as the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, but other ratios like 80/10/10 or 60/20/20 might also be employed depending on the requirements of the project.
