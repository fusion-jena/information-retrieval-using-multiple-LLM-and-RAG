The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

between 0.2 and 0.5 indicate acceptable accuracy, and values above 0.5 
indicate incorrect predictions.

3.1.1. CASA model 

Using  light  energy  utilization  efficiency  as  a  basis,  in  the  CASA 
model, NPP is obtained by multiplying the absorbed photosynthetically 
active radiation (APAR) in green vegetation, with the light energy uti-
lization  efficiency  of  APAR  converted  into  plant  biomass  increment 
(Potter et al., 1993). Based on the above principles of CASA model, NPP 
is calculated using the following formula: 

NPP(x, t) = ε(x, t) × APAR(x, t)

Here, x represents the pixel and t represents the time; NPP(x, t) de-
(cid:0) 2; ε(x, t) denotes how 
notes the NPP of pixel x in month t, in units of g⋅m
(cid:0) 1; 
much light energy pixel x consumed in month t, with unit of g⋅MJ
APAR(x, t) denotes the radiation produced by pixel x in month t when 
photosynthetically active, in units of MJ⋅m

(cid:0) 2. 

APAR(x, t) = SOL(x, t) × FPAR(x, t) × 0.5

Here, Tε1(x, t) represents the limiting effect of vegetation at low and 
high temperatures, while Tε2(x, t) denotes the ambient temperature to 
which the vegetation is exposed. Wε(x, t) signifies the effect of humidity 
conditions  on  the  use  of  light  energy.  εmax  represents  the  vegetation 
conversion efficiency to APAR under an ideal condition, signifying the 
maximum percentage utilization of the light energy. Parameter εmax  is 
pivotal  for  calculating  light  use  efficiency  in  the  model  and  its  value 
varies  according  to  region  and  vegetation  type.  Huang  et  al.  (2023) 
applied  the  CASA  model  to  estimate  NPP  in  the  ASEAN  region  by 
exploring and adopting locally εmax  value. In this research, we employed 
the εmax  value proposed by Zhu et al. (2007), which is suitable for the 
Chinese region and has been utilized for regional-scale NPP estimation 
(Xiao et al., 2022). The εmax  of each vegetation type used in this research

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that the PLUS model uses development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data, which could potentially serve as a means to evaluate the model's performance over time. Additionally, the PLUS model employs a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds, which might also contribute to monitoring the model's progress during training. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the actual implementation or evaluation metrics, it remains unclear what exact strategies are being used to monitor the model performance during training.
