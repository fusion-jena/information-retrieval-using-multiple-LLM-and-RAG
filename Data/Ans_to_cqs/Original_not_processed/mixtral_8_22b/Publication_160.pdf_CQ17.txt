contextual information. If the patch size is too small, it contains in-
sufficient information and most probably fails to capture whole in-
dividuals; if it is too large, the context scrambles the signature of the
central information, confusing the algorithm. The patch size 64 × 64
pixels performed the worst out of all the metrics; the large differences
between validation and test performances was indicative of its poor
capacity for generalization. A patch size of 224 × 224 gave the highest
micro-F1 on the test set (65.94). This patch size included enough con-
textual noise to regularize overfitting, and it enabled better general-
ization. While the single RestNet18 based on the patch size 224 × 224
obtained the best accuracy, our ensemble network, which was based on
the four tested patch sizes and followed the feature extraction scheme
improved classification

2.3. Automatic classification via deeply learned features

Training a LR on the penultimate and final layers of the ensemble
network improved classification performances (72.20 vs 70.37 micro-
F1, see Table 4). LRs derived from the results of the concatenation of
the GAP or the first fully connected layer (fc512) greatly decreased
performances on the validation set and led to a further decrease in
performance on the test set, indicating that the LR massively overfitted
the training set. It is widely known that using a CNN in combination
with other machine learning algorithms can improve classification ac-
curacy (Donahue et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017; Li
and Yu, 2016), but additionally applying them to the logits of a neural
network is further beneficial to the use of a selective classification
framework, LR is a linear classifier that uses negative log-likelihood
(NLL) as a loss function for a multiclass problem. When feeding the
logits taken from the last layer of the ensemble network into a softmax,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses how the choice of patch size can help with preventing overfitting by including enough contextual noise. Specifically, a patch size of 224 x 224 pixels was found to give the highest micro-F1 score on the test set, as it included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting and enable better generalization. Additionally, the text mentions that combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with other machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression (LR) can also improve classification accuracy and help prevent overfitting.
