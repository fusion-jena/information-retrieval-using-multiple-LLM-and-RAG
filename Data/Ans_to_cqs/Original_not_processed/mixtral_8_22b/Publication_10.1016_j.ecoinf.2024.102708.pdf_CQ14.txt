adjusted when drafting a drone survey by entering the camera model or 
camera parameters and the flight altitude in any of the most common 
drone planning software tools including DJI GS PRO, Pix4D or Litchi.

survey grade cameras with better shutter speed and pixel resolution such 
as the 35 mm lens DJI Zenmuse P1, the same resolution of 0.5 cm can be 
achieved  at  40  m  altitude,  further  increasing  the  area  that  can  be 
covered on each drone campaign (approximately up to 15 Ha within 30 
min).

As three of our models are based on the YOLO structure, we would 
expect the results to be relatively similar, and the results demonstrate 
the success on small training data quantities compared to larger model 
complexity. Intuitively, it would be expected that a smaller model can 
successfully learn from fewer data to represent less complex problems, 
whereas larger more complex models may require more data to repre-
sent more complexity within the object to detect. The results indicated 
that YOLOv5s, as the smallest model, performs best in terms of preci-
sion. The TPH-YOLOv5, which is an extension of the YOLOv5s model is a 
slightly more complex model, and further pre-training on RPAS specific 
imagery. The results indicated that detection of Pacific oysters does not 
demand  the  complexity  of  the  larger  YOLOv5m  model  and  using  the 
TPH-YOLOv5 model pre-trained with RPAS data, is not beneficial in this 
instance.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether through methods like grid search, random search, or other techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.
