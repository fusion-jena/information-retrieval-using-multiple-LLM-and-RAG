Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

We obtained a test dataset of 4405 annotated ﬁsh thumbnails be-
longing to 18 out of the 20 species present in the training dataset (Table
S3). We then randomly selected a subset of 1197 ﬁsh thumbnails be-
longing to 9 species to compare the performance of humans vs. ob-
tained models (Table S3).

2.2. Deep-learning algorithm

We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to build
a ﬁsh identiﬁcation model (Schmidhuber, 2015). CNNs are a class of
deep learning algorithms used to analyze data and particularly to
classify objects from images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).

CNNs are made of layers of interconnected neurons and each neuron
includes a ‘convolutional kernel’ that computes a set of mathematical
operations (deﬁned by ‘weights’) on the matrices of values describing
the image (i.e. values for each color channel for each pixel).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the model is designed for fish identification and classification. The model uses a GoogleNet architecture, which is known for its high accuracy in image recognition tasks. Additionally, the model is tested on a dataset of fish thumbnails belonging to different species, further suggesting that the primary goal of the model is to identify and classify fish species accurately.
