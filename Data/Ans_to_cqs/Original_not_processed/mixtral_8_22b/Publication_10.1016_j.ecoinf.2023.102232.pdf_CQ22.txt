Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Computing tools 

All the calculations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific 
computing centre of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia. The system 
provides  for  two  Hewlett  Packard  Enterprise  (HPE)  ProLiant  DL560 
Gen10 nodes, each one equipped with: four processors Intel Xeon Gold 
5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads; and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes 
worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package 
Ray,  version  1.9.2.  All  the  scripts  and  dataset  to  fully  reproduce  the 
results of this work are publicly available at https://github.com/lucar 
os1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo. 

2.5. Preliminary analysis with perturbed numerical solutions and given 
parameters

From each combination of values belonging to the first quarter of 
values stored in the Python dictionary, the GA generates four random 
combinations of initial values considered as input for the LS procedure 
previously described. Each best fit value stored in a single row of the 
dictionary is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution, 
μ, while the associated variance is still considered as σ2  = (zμ)2. Each 
new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the 
genetic algorithm is again stored in the database together with all the 
previously estimated sets of values. 

At the end of a genetic algorithm cycle, the rows of the database are 
again ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual. The 
genetic algorithm can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for 
simplicity we considered a nGAC = 2, that leads to a total number of nTGA 
= 2nGAC+1 ⋅ nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

method  to  estimate  the  model  parameters  directly  from  field  data,  where  experimental  activities  are  less 
expensive and less time consuming. In this study we propose a combination of least squares methods via genetic 
algorithms to preliminary evaluate the best parameter values and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain 
their distribution. The algorithm has been tested in the special case of Drosophila suzukii, to quantify part of the 
parameters  of  an almost  validated model in  two  steps:  i) a first pseudo-validation  using perturbed  numerical 
solutions, and ii) a validation using real field data. The results highlighted the potentialities of the algorithm in 
estimating model parameters and opened several perspectives for further improvements from both the compu-
tational and experimental point of view.

The hybrid MCMC algorithm provides a series of independent chains 
containing a trace of values for each parameter to estimate. The traces 
corresponding to each chain are stored in specific text files and can be 
further analysed to obtain the final parameter values, their distribution, 
and  their  associated  uncertainty.  The  key  point  of  this  phase  of  the 
process is to evaluate if each chain provides a set of “best” values that are 
“suitable” to represent, once inserted into the model, the field dataset. In 
case different chains lead to a set of best-fitting parameters that faith-
fully represent the field data, the corresponding traces can be merged to 
obtain the final value as the mean of their values and the uncertainty as 
the standard deviation.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears there might be some confusion regarding the nature of the information requested. The context primarily discusses the use of computing tools, such as the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center, and the application of a hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Least Squares method combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters. However, there is no explicit mention or discussion of any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query about what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the type of problem being addressed.
