in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter clock wise shear and a 
random zoom between 0 and 0.2 - all leading to 224 × 244 pixel RGB 
input tensors. Data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, and the 
pixels values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. Model training took 
roughly 4 days. The best model was selected based on minimal valida-
tion loss that occurred at epoch 448. This model showed a training loss 
of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298 and 
validation accuracy of 0.891. We evaluated the red kite model perfor-
mance based on an independent test set of 2060 images (as described in 
3.3). 950 of these images were true positive red kites images and the

In this paper we propose, implement and evaluate a workflow taking 
advantage of citizen science data documenting and recording sightings 
of birds, and more specifically red kites (Milvus milvus). Analysing social 
media data until recently has often used simple keyword-based methods 
to perform an initial filtering or search step, meaning that content tag-
ged in other ways was not found. However, improvements in content- 
based  classification  now  mean  that  it  is  also  possible  to  use  off-the- 
shelf,  pre-trained  algorithms  to  reliably  identify  predefined  classes 
such  as  presence  of  buildings,  people  or  birds  in  image  data  with 
reasonable accuracy. Our workflow uses these improvements, together 
with training data generated from citizen scientists, to identify further 
relevant sightings in a social media dataset using both textual metadata 
and  image  content.  Since  both  datasets  include  metadata  capturing

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the information about the model's performance evaluation based on an independent test set of 2060 images, out of which 950 are true positive red kites images, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for object detection or classification tasks related to identifying red kites in images. Additionally, the mention of using pre-trained algorithms to reliably identify predefined classes such as the presence of birds in image data suggests that the model might be employed for classifying bird species in images. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, one cannot definitively state the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
