number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

The  energy  magnitude  and  distribution  across  different  frequency 
ranges are considered crucial information in the spectrograms generated 
by WT. By incorporating the CBAM attention module into the generator, 
the  model  can  learn  weight  parameters  for  the  spectrogram  channels 
and spatial dimensions. It enables the generator to focus more on the 
vital  information  in  the  image,  ultimately  enhancing  the  quality  and 
level of detail in the generated image.

3.4.2. Classification evaluation metrics 

To  evaluate  the  accuracy  and  effectiveness  of  the  classification 
model, we use several metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1- 
score,  Top-1  accuracy,  Top-5  accuracy,  Top-1  error,  and  Top-5  error. 
The formulas for these metrics are shown in 14. 

Accuracy =

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error to monitor the model performance during training. These metrics were calculated using specific formulas, which have been mentioned in the context. Additionally, the authors compared the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of the sampled generated spectrogram of different ACGAN models. They also presented figures showing the classification accuracy of different models in two experimental groups, with bars representing the Top-1 accuracy for each network group and lines representing the Top-5 accuracy. However, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy or methodology employed to monitor the model performance during training beyond these evaluation methods.
