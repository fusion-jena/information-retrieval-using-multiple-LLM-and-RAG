Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that large datasets are necessary to optimize the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, it discusses the need for a certain number of images for training and validation purposes, specifically mentioning that the zebra finch data required 400 pictures for training and 100 for validation. For other species like sociable weavers and great tits, the Mask R-CNN was used to identify multiple birds perching simultaneously at the RFID antenna, but no specific datasets were mentioned. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
