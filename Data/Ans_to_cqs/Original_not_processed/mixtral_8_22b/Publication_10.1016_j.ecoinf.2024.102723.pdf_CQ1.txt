5. Conclusions

The ongoing need for advances in Deep Learning techniques applied
to agriculture is driving research towards the development of cost-
effective models, robust to noise and variability, facilitating real-time
decision-making (Attri et al., 2023). Current frameworks are hindered
by their reliance on large datasets, limited interpretability, and chal-
lenges in generalization; they are deployed on personal computers,
which are inefficient and energy-intensive for practical applications.
Therefore, it is essential for emerging smart farming–oT initiatives in
agriculture to be supported by a new perspective in artificial intelligence
research (Abdar et al., 2021; Attri et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2022).

Query: "What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning and IoT in agriculture, we can infer that various methods might be employed. These include using sensors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors, cameras for image analysis, drones for remote sensing, GPS for location tracking, and weather stations for meteorological data collection. Additionally, public datasets like satellite imagery from platforms like Google Earth Engine could also be leveraged. Surveys may also be conducted to gather additional information relevant to the agricultural context. It should be noted that these are speculative answers based on typical approaches rather than direct evidence from the given text.
