distance  and  each  of  the  original  features  of  the  background  points 
(Fig. 1-D). The MIC measures the amount of information shared by each 
pair (Hausser and Strimmer, 2021). One advantage of using the MIC is 
that it considers a diverse array of relationships, not simply a linear one 
(Kraskov et al., 2004; Zeng, 2015). Another group of indices was esti-
mated with the package PresenceAbsence (Freeman and Moisen, 2008) 
to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier; i.e., with 
probabilities for presence (species points, Sss) and absence (background 
points,  Ssb),  we  calculated  the  area  under  the  curve  (AUC),  receiver 
operating  characteristics  (ROC)  (Valavi  et  al.,  2022),  kappa  index  K 
(Cohen, 1960), and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index (Fig. 1-D). 
The AUC ranges between 0 and 1, in which the closer to 1 the value, the 
better the model (Valavi et al., 2022). The kappa index ranges between

(cid:0) 1 to 1, and again, the closer to 1 the value, the better the model. The 
COR index is similar to the correlation coefficient but applied to a binary 
response. These indices are commonly used to assess species distribution 
models (Phillips and Elith, 2010). For comparative purposes, the UMAP 
runs  were  performed  by  fixing  the  hyperparameters  of  minimum  dis-
tance  at  0.005  and  the  number  of  neighbors  at  15  using  the  uwot 
package  (Melville,  2022)  with  the  R  language  version  4.2.1  (R  Core 
Team,  2022).  Moreover,  Maxent  3.4.4  (Phillips  et  al.,  2017)  was  run 
with its default parameters and 10 replications to compare the AUC of 
both models and to visualize their geographic distributions (Fig. 1-C5). 
MaxEnt runs were performed with the same data sets for species and 
background  points  and  with  the  same  selected  variables  presented  in 
Table 1.

Helpful Answer:
To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics can be used. In this case, the authors use the maximum information coefficient (MIC) to measure the amount of information shared by each pair of features. This metric has the advantage of considering a diverse array of relationships, not only linear ones. Additionally, they estimate another set of indices using the package PresenceAbsence to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier. These include the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index. The AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate a better model. Similarly, the kappa index ranges from -1 to 1, with values close to 1 indicating a better model. The COR index is like the correlation coefficient but applied to a binary response. These indices are commonly used to assess species distribution models.
