1.  Advancement  of  inductive  biases  by  exploring  the  effect  of  pre- 

training on a more relevant data distribution. 

2. Increased interpretability by introducing a simple method to inter-

pret downstream classification.  

3.  Better temporal aggregation by integrating intermittent and periodic 

audio signals over time into a probabilistic representation.

quency response that create a potential bias; we demonstrate how a simple linear transformation can be used to 
mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation under our approach. Our novel approach 
paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable learned 
ecoacoustic representations to advance both fundamental and applied science and support global conservation 
efforts.

The  encoder  uses  a  pre-processing  block  containing  a  convolution 
with a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along 
the time axis (2 × 1 kernel) (Kahl et al., 2021). Coarsening follows the 
changes suggested in (He et al., 2018) and replicates later versions of 
BirdNet’s  down-sampling  strategy  by  recombining  the  concatenated 
output  of  2 × 2  maximum and  2  × 2 average  pooling using  a  1 × 1 
convolution.  After  convolution,  feature  representations  are  chunked 
along the time axis into T = 19 independent frames each corresponding 
to 3.072 s. Each frame is flattened and passed through a final linear layer 
to  output  T  d-dimensional  mean  μ  and  log  variance  logσ2  vectors  as 
parameters  for  the  Gaussian  variational  posterior.  A  latent  vector  for 
each frame in the time-series is sampled from the posterior using the 
reparameterisation trick. We set d = 128 for comparability with ecoa-

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a technique to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. This technique involves applying a simple linear transformation after the initial convolution operation in the pre-processing block. The aim of this transformation is to counteract the potential bias introduced by frequency responses that vary across different hardware devices. Therefore, while not directly addressing data bias in terms of class imbalance or diversity, this approach attempts to ensure that the learned representations remain consistent despite variations in recording equipment.
