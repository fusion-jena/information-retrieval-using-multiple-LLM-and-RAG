5.2. Species detection per session and habitat 

The results of the linear mixed modelling (Table 4) concur with that 
of the overall pooled data with the survey type and the interaction be-
tween  survey  type  and  survey  method  being  statistically  significant 
(Fig. 4.). 

The interaction between habitat and survey type was strongly sig-
nificant whereas the interaction between habitat and survey method was 
not (Fig. 5.).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context alone.
