the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

For each of these experiments, table columns are

Herbarium specimen classification
These experiments aim at assessing the feasibility of using
a deep learning system dedicated to herbarium specimen
identification at a realistic scale (255 species from Costa-
Rica in Herbarium255 and 1K species from France in
Herbarium1K). Herbarium255 was divided in 70% train-
ing data and the rest 30% as test data used for computing
the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Herbarium1K
was divided in 80 and 20% respectively, to keep the pro-
portion of the data provided by the PC challenge. The
separation was done by species, and within each species,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data was split based on the proportion of the data provided by the PC challenge. For Herbarium255, the data was divided into 70% training data and the remaining 30% as test data. This division was done for computing the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Similarly, Herbarium1K was divided into 80% training data and 20% testing data. The separation was carried out by species, and within each species, the division was made accordingly.
