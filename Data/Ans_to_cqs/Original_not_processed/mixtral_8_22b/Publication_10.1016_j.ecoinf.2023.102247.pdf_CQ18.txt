3.1. Model accuracy

To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

Helpful Answer:
The authors employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the remaining 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. They used the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the index to measure the accuracy of their models. A higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate. This means that they monitored the model performance during training by evaluating its ability to accurately classify or predict the target variable based on the input features. By splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, they could assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, which helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can perform well when applied to real-world scenarios.
