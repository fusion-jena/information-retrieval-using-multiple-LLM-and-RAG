flight time and performance. Flying time and performance is linked to 
many weather factors like temperature, wind, precipitation, solar radi-
ation, and these factors combined dictate if and when honey bees will 
take flight.

Qu´ebec with a high spatial resolution of 10 m pixel, which includes 
land  (cropland, 
the  following  thematic  classes:  agricultural 
pastureland,  vineyards,  and  ornamental  horticulture,  etc.),  forest 
environments  (conifer,  deciduous,  mixed,  shrubland,  cuts  and 
regeneration, etc.), wetlands (bogs, swamps, meadows, ponds, etc.), 
aquatic  environments  (streams,  canals,  lakes,  reservoirs,  etc.), 
anthropogenic environments (residential, commercial or industrial, 
etc.), and bare land (strip mines, quarries, bare exposed rock, etc.) 
(see Table 1 and Fig. S1.1 in the Supplementary Material for details 
of the land cover class).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study primarily uses raster and vector data formats. The LULC dataset is a raster format with a high spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel. Other datasets mentioned include MNT-Lidar, Weather data, Database of Parcels and Declared Agricultural Production (BDPPAD), Geobase of Quebec Hydrographic Network (GRHQ), and Geobase Addresses Quebec. However, the specific file formats for these datasets are not explicitly stated. It is common for raster data to be stored in formats such as.TIFF,.GEOTIFF, or.IMG, while vector data might use formats like.SHP,.KML, or.GPX. Without more detailed information about each dataset, I cannot definitively state the exact file formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
