For each fold, the frames from Trainingclips  were used to train the 
models. The Testingclips were used to assess the robustness of our method 
on short sequences centered around the presence of fish presence. The 
Testingstations, common to all k-fold were used to assess the robustness of 
the method on 1-h videos, corresponding to the real use-case scenarios 
of ecological studies (Supp. Fig. 1). 

2. Methods

displayed a slightly higher F-measure standard deviation, ranging from 
0.08 to 0.11 between models. Considering the superior performance of 
the models trained on 27 species (Supp. Table 1), these were selected for 
subsequent analyses.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods such as grid search or random search. However, it can be noted that the authors did perform cross-validation by splitting their data into training and testing sets, as well as selecting the best performing models based on their results.
