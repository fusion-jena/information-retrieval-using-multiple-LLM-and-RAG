Augmentation is an important part of the neural network learning process that resolves the
problem of overﬁtting [53,54]. Original satellite images were obtained in diﬀerent atmospheric
conditions and had slightly diﬀerent values of saturation, so we decided to use a speciﬁc augmentation
technique to expand the number of training images, and thereby improve the network performance.
As an augmentation transformation, we chose random changes of RGB channels of the original images
and random vertical and horizontal ﬂips. Random changes for each RGB channel did not exceed
0.1 by absolute value and were applied simultaneously to all channels, as it is implemented in the
utility function “apply_channel_shift” from the Keras package [54]. Random ﬂips provided additional
variability of images used for training and reduced overﬁtting. We also considered using small random
rotations in the augmentation pipeline. However, adding rotations did not improve the network

Therefore, having a batch size of 20 and performing typically up to 1500 epochs for training the

network, we used almost 30,000 diﬀerent augmented images of size 256 × 256.

2.4. Artiﬁcial Neural Network Architecture

The problem of forest damage identiﬁcation is a semantic segmentation problem. Eﬀorts to solve
such problems have recently made signiﬁcant progress due to artiﬁcial neural networks of complex
architecture, which are closely related to a general term referred to as deep learning [55–57].

Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classiﬁcation problem aimed at determining the class of
the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. It is usually handled by means of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). As was noted in the introduction, one of such CNNs is U-Net, which is of an
encoder-decoder architecture [58].

Helpful Answer: The authors applied specific data augmentation techniques to address the issue of overfitting caused by different atmospheric conditions during image acquisition. They employed two main transformations: random changes to the RGB channels of the original images and random vertical and horizontal flips. These changes did not exceed 0.1 by absolute value and were applied simultaneously to all channels using the utility function 'apply\_channel\_shift' from the Keras package. Additionally, they considered using small random rotations but found that this did not improve the network's performance. With a batch size of 20 and up to 1500 epochs for training, nearly 30,000 different augmented images of size 256 x 256 were utilized.
