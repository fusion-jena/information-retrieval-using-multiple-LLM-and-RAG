One  of  the  most  valuable  tools  developed  in  recent  years  is  deep 
learning models which have been used for the tasks mentioned above

In this paper, we present an automated framework that allows the 
monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over 
extended periods and across various time scales. The framework relies 
on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model (BirdNET-Analyzer, n.d.),

Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model presented in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model, known as BirdNET-Analyzer, is designed for the task of identifying and classifying bird species based on their vocalizations. This is supported by the fact that the authors mention applying the framework to more than 80 species and selecting 20 species with the highest recall scores for further analysis. Additionally, the reference to the BirdNET paper suggests that the model is part of a larger project focused on avian diversity monitoring using deep learning techniques. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary purpose of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model is likely related to the classification or identification of bird species through their vocalizations.
