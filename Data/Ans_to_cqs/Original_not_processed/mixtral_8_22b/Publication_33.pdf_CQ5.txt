Material and methods
Data.  We decided to build our own dataset instead of using existing datasets (e.g. Fish4Knowledge: https ://
group s.inf.ed.ac.uk/f4k/), to be in phase with quality of videos currently used by marine ecologists. We used 3 
independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test our CNN 
model and our post processing method. For the 3 datasets, we used fish images extracted from 175 underwa-
ter high-definition videos which lasted between 5 and 21 min for a total of 83 h. The videos were recorded in 
1920 × 1,080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3 + black and Hero 4 + black. The videos were recorded between 2 and 30 m 
deep, with a broad range of luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and bar-
rier reefs.

Whatever the goal, our framework is highly flexible and can be adapted by tuning the species thresholds 
regulating the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage in an attempt to monitor biodiversity 
through big datasets where species are unidentified. To unclog the bottleneck of information extraction about 
organism forms, behaviors and sounds from massive digital data, machine learning algorithms, and particularly 
the last generation of deep learning algorithms, offer immense promises. Here we propose to help the users to 
control their error rates in ecology. This is a valuable addition to the ecologist’s toolkit towards a routine and 
robust analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors. With this control of error 
rate in the hands of users, Deep Learning Algorithms can be used for real applications, with acceptable and

Helpful Answer:
The authors built their own dataset instead of using existing ones like Fish4Knowledge. They used three independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and their post-processing method. These datasets consisted of fish images extracted from 175 underwater high-definition videos, lasting between 5 and 21 minutes for a total of 83 hours. The videos were recorded in 1920 x 1080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3+ Black and Hero 4+ Black cameras. The videos were recorded between 2 and 30 meters deep, with varying luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and barrier reefs.
