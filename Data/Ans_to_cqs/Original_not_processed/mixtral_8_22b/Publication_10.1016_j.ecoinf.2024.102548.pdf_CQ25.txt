5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments.

classification tasks. The evaluation of model performance was based on 
the  accuracy  metric.  Each  model  underwent  training  for  10  epochs, 
utilizing  a  batch  size  of  32.  The  class  mode  was  set  to  ‘categorical,’ 
indicating  that  the  labels  were  encoded  using  one-hot  encoding  for 
multi-class  classification  tasks.  These  generalized  parameter  settings 
were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and 
standardization throughout the study experiments.

3.2.4. ResNet-50 

ResNet-50 is a widely used deep residual neural network architecture 
that addresses the challenges of training very deep networks. It employs 
residual blocks with skip connections to enable the flow of gradients and 
facilitate the training of deeper models. ResNet-50 has been pre-trained 
on  large-scale  datasets,  allowing  it  to  capture  complex  patterns  and 
achieve strong performance.

InceptionV3 

InceptionV3 is an advanced CNN architecture that incorporates the 
concept of inception modules. These modules utilize parallel convolu-
tions  of  different  kernel  sizes  to  capture  multi-scale  features.  Incep-
tionV3  has  been  pre-trained  on 
large-scale  datasets  and  has 
demonstrated  excellent  performance  in  various  image  classification 
tasks.

Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning models discussed in this study is not explicitly stated. However, considering the common applications of these models, we can infer that they might be used for image classification tasks. Specifically, both ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 have demonstrated excellent performance in various image classification tasks. Additionally, the evaluation of model performance mentioned in the context is based on the accuracy metric, which is commonly used for assessing the effectiveness of classification models. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning models in this study is not specified, it can be reasonably assumed that their primary function is image classification.
