4. Discussion 

Ensemble models for all orchid groups have AUC values >0.90 and 
TSS > 0.80 for predicting current suitable areas. These models include 
almost 92% of the actual occurrence records for lowland epiphyte, 94% 
for lowland terrestrial, 96% for upland epiphyte, and 98% for upland 
terrestrial.  Ensemble  models  also  predict  that  the  suitable  areas  for 
lowland  epiphyte  orchids  cover  14.89%  of  the  total  New  Guinea’s 
mainland  area,  11.11%  for  lowland  terrestrial,  18.83%  for  upland 
epiphyte, and 16.54% for upland terrestrial orchids. Lowland and up-
land orchids, either epiphytic or terrestrial, are predicted to respond to 
climate change and land cover change by shifting their suitable areas. 
The lowland  epiphyte  group is  predicted to  lose suitable  areas in  the 
worst case climate change scenario (SSP 5–8.5), but suitable areas for 
lowland  orchids  will  expand  in  the  most  optimistic  climate  change 
scenario (SSP 1–2.6).

data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for this purpose.
