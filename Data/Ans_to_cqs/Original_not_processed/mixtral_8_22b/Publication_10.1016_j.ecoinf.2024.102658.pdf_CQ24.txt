4.2.1. Baseline model: random forest 

Random forest (Breiman, 2001) utilizes an ensemble of classification 
or regression trees; each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of the 
training dataset, and represents a series of sequential decisions, in which 
each node of the tree is a binary split made on a predictive feature (e.g., 
whether  the  mean  annual  temperature  is  above  25 
C).  Further,  a 
random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at 
each node (we use a value of sqrt(n), n being the number of potential 
predictors, for the size of this subset). When used for classification, the 
outputs from the component trees are put through a majority vote to 
create a single output. This is known to be a simple but powerful method 
of retaining the complex non-linearity of decision trees while avoiding 
overfitting.

The list of features. We utilize two feature sets selected through different CV 
processes  in  a  previous  study  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024),  which  we  name  the 
‘random-CV’ feature set and the ‘spatial-CV’ feature set, respectively. The two 
feature sets share six common features.

The  final  settings  restricted  the  non-linearity  enough  to  make  the 
models fit on random-CV features resemble the results from Bayesian 
and  MLE  logistic  regression.  The  models  fit  on  spatial-CV  features, 
however, still gave very unrealistic predictions for the future, in which 
every area on Earth is a suitable habitat for Elephas maximus. It seemed 
that restricting the priors and the basis dimension of the model has only 
a limited effect that varied depending on the feature set used to fit the 
models. 

6.2.2. Random forest

frequently in the best-performing feature set were retained for the final 
model  (Mechenich  et  al.,  2024).  Random  and  spatial  CV  selected 
different feature sets, and these are compared in our final modeling and 
analysis,  under  the  names  ‘random-CV’  and  ‘spatial-CV’  features, 
respectively.  Lists  of  features  and  short  descriptions  are  presented  in 
Table 1. 

5.2.2. Feature scaling 

We tested both raw and scaled versions of features when modeling. 
Thus, there were four feature sets to fit per model type (raw random-CV 
features, scaled random-CV features, raw spatial-CV features, and scaled 
spatial-CV features).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, some general strategies to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value before training the model, using cross-validation techniques, and employing ensemble methods like random forests. In the case of random forests, multiple decision trees are created with different subsets of data and features, reducing overfitting and improving overall performance.
