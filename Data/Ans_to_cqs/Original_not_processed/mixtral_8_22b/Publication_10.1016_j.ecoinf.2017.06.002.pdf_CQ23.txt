start, middle, or end of the sampling period), 3) data processing level
with related processing approaches (e.g. raw, translated/processed,
data originator QA/QC, project-level QA/QC), 4) references to the
measurement setting description (e.g., E-ﬁeld Log ﬁle)—this informa-
tion is essential because it links the data to additional metadata re-
ported in the separate templates described in Section 3.3 (see
Fig. 2)—, and 5) references to data ﬁle descriptions (Data Column
Description).

approaches because common and transparent processing approaches
facilitate comparability. An additional advantage of this ﬂexible ap-
proach is that data originators and consumers can assimilate data into
variety of databases. A key component of this ﬂexibility is achieved by
separating the data column description from the data ﬁle description so
that the data column description can be customized to the speciﬁc data
ﬁle.

4.3. Lessons learned and future development

Additionally, for every data ﬁle, a corresponding “Data Column
Description” template provides the information necessary to under-
stand the data ﬁle. This is a semi-standardized template that includes
information on header rows (e.g., those automatically generated by
instrumentation), column names, units, data averaging (e.g.,
in-
stantaneous or a mean/standard deviation over the sampling period),
measurement
ID,
Measurement Position ID, or Sample ID) if multiple measurement po-
sitions are recorded in the same ﬁle. The location identiﬁer is critical
because it links the observations to installation details and other events
aﬀecting data quality that are described in the measurement setting
templates. Data originators can conﬁgure the Data Column Description
as a series of tabs in a single MS Excel ﬁle, a standalone ﬁle, or as a
separate tab within the data ﬁles (if data ﬁle is MS Excel).
