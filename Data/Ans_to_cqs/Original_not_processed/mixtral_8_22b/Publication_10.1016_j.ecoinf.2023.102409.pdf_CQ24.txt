Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) is an essential indicator that captures variations in vegetation and doc-
uments the impacts of climate change and human activity for environmental assessment. However, conventional 
methods encounter challenges in accurately extracting fine-scale FVC in drylands due to the vegetation distri-
bution being very heterogeneous in space with patches and inter-patches. Using the lower Tarim River Basin as a 
typical study case, we investigated three deep convolutional neural networks—Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3 +
—to generate high-precision FVC in drylands with high-resolution (0.8 m) remote sensing images. Among these 
models,  the  Unet  model  performed  better,  with  an  accuracy  of  93.38%,  while  the  accuracy  of  Pspnet  and 
Deeplabv3+ was 88.14% and 88.91%, respectively. Comparison with the FVC derived from normalized differ-
ence vegetation index (NDVI),  and land use/land cover data  from ESRI and ESA indicated that  the FVC map

dryland vegetation coverage is urgently needed. Numerous studies have 
developed modeling to estimate vegetation coverage. For example, Zhao 
et al. (2023b) used GaoFen-1 satellite, which carries a wide-field view, 
to generate FVC data in China with a spatial resolution of 16 m using the 
gap  probability  theory  and  dimidiate  pixel  model.  Jiang  and  Zheng 
(2022), using classical algorithms such as the maximum entropy method 
and convolutional neural networks, proposed a deep learning approach 
that can recognize forest cover with an overall accuracy of 88.85% at a

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models by reducing the impact of random factors on their performance.
