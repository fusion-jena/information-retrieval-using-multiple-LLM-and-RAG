incorporation  of  covariates  on  the  reproductive  process  requires 
analytical tools beyond the simple description of gonadal development. 
During  the  last  decade  the  application  of  Machine  Learning  (ML) 
techniques has grown in many research areas, serving to model complex 
relationships in ecology, genetics, and climate change (Lindegren et al., 
2020;  Rolnick  et  al.,  2022;  Schrider  and  Kern,  2018;  Smoli´nski  and 
Radtke, 2017). Machine learning algorithms use computational methods 
to  “learn”  directly  from  data  without  relying  on  a  carefully  defined 
function  as  a  model  -  in  contrast  to  a  linear  model  say,  where  the 
function must be made explicit. They are generally predictive models 
and characterised by having few assumptions and little dependency on 
the  classic  statistical  assumptions  of  conventional  models  (e.g.  error

distributions,  collinearity).  In  recent  years,  different  algorithms  have 
been successfully applied in fisheries biology, such as Boosted Regres-
sion Trees to assess the relative importance of environmental and har-
vesting  effects  on  herring  growth  (Lyashevska  et  al.,  2020),  as  well 
predicting bycatch on a demersal crustacean fishery in Chile (Montero 
et al., 2020). Random Forest have been applied for stock differentiation 
in pink cusk-eel using morphometric measurements of sagittal otoliths 
(Wiff  et  al.,  2020),  as  well  as  investigating  the  influence  of  environ-
mental and density-dependent factors on the growth of North Sea sprat 
(Lindegren  et  al.,  2020).  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  have  been 
widely applied to analyse salmon scale images for growth determination 
(Vabø et al., 2021). Random Forests (RFs) are one of the most popular 
machine learning techniques for both classification and regression, and

when sampling the fundamentally different population conditions of a 
healthy  versus depleted  stock. The use of  RFs has the  potential to  be 
applied for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attri-
butes  are  essential  for  their  management  and  conservation  in  the 
ecosystem. Machine learning methods may offer an accurate alternative 
to traditional methods to improve our biological understanding in future 
or retrospective research.

Helpful Answer:
There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a significant imbalance between classes in the dataset. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until it reaches a similar number as the majority class. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is another technique used to handle class imbalance. It involves removing examples from the majority class until it reaches a similar number as the minority class. However, this method can result in loss of information if too many examples are removed.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real world. This can help reduce bias caused by overrepresentation of certain groups or underrepresentation of others.

In addition to these techniques, regularization methods such as dropout and weight decay can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can also be used to increase the amount of available data and improve model robustness.

Overall, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is crucial for building accurate and reliable models. By employing appropriate techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, we can mitigate the impact of bias and build more equitable AI systems.
