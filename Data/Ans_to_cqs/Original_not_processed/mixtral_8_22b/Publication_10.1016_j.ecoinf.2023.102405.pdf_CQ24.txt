Water contamination presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting the sustainability of ecosystems 
and  the  health  of  aquatic  organisms.  Precisely  assessing  water  contamination  levels  is  crucial  for  effective 
monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating 
water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. 
Integrating  computer  technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  and  Data 
Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have 
limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study 
proposes  a  comprehensive  framework  that  incorporates  IoT-based  data  collection  and  data  segregation  tech-

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. This ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or machines. Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones where possible. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping can help reduce variance due to random sampling. Regularization methods such as dropout also introduce controlled randomness during training which helps prevent overfitting. Finally, ensemble methods combine multiple models trained on different subsets of data or with varying hyperparameters to improve overall robustness and generalizability.
