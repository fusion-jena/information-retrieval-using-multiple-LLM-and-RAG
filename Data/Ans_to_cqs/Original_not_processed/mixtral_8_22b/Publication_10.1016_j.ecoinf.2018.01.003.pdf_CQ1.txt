(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

tolerance of 0, and the least allowable gradient as 1e-5 (Fig. 5). The
experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6).

Data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. The network
ﬁnally converges after 50–100 iterations (repeated experiments) using
5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. The results predict
the 2014 total EF of Beijing to be 8726 ten thousand acres with an error
of 2% and a standard deviation of 1082, compared to the actual value of

8874 ten thousand acres. The 2015 value is predicted to be 8743 ten
thousand acres with an error of 3%, a standard deviation of 1193 and a
root mean square error (RMSE) of 121.65, compared to the actual value
of 8984 ten thousand acres. (Table 2).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets to gather their input data. For instance, they could have collected data through environmental monitoring systems equipped with sensors, or accessed publicly available databases containing relevant ecological indicators. Additionally, they may have conducted surveys to collect socioeconomic data related to urban development and resource consumption patterns. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors, we cannot definitively state the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular research project.
