gaping is linked to key metabolic functions like filtering water necessary 
for feeding and respiration.

These may be inferred by combining more mechanistic models with the 
empirical laboratory experiments (e.g. Guarini et al., 2021). Given the 
availability of sensors and the fast development of technology, having 
big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms together with 
temperature  and  chlorophyll,  becomes  more  and  more  feasible  these 
days. Having such big-data should improve predictions on productivity, 
and be a major aid for aquaculture decision making, for multiple areas 
and species, especially in the context of ‘precision shellfish farming’. 

Funding

(Jørgensen et al., 1988), changes to gaping can have long term conse-
quences on organisms energetics. Obtaining values of energetic expen-
diture  associated  with  valve  movements  would  be  highly  valuable  to 
gain a deeper understanding and to be able to model the consequences of 
gaping changes, not only in terms of its modulation of energy input, but 
also to account for associated energetic loss. Bioenergetic models can be 
used to inform both aquaculture practices and management measures: e. 
g. allocation of space for aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021b; Brigolin 
et  al.,  2017);  quantification  of  ecosystem  functioning  and  services 
associated both with aquaculture (Bertolini et al., 2021a; Brigolin et al., 
2009) and with naturally occurring populations. It would thus be useful 
to  apply  this  clustering  methodology,  which  yielded  some  consistent 
results amongst two species and two areas, to analyse gaping data from

also other bivalve species and other locations. This may go so far as even 
including  bivalves  in  offshore  environments.  Overall,  this  would 
improve bioenergetic models, where clearance and respiration terms are 
inherently  linked  with  gaping.  The  current  formulations  of  models 
however do not account for linkages with food, aside from considering a 
half saturation constant, nor the different degrees of daily oscillations. 
Further  experimentation,  under  constrained  lab  conditions,  linking 
gaping activity with actual clearance rate and respiration rates under 
different  settings  will  also  help  devising  indices  that  could  be  then 
extrapolated to use gaping directly in the models. An indication of en-
ergy consumption during valve movement would also be useful to infer 
the  consequences of  having  a more or less  pronounced  amplitudes of 
gaping, to better formulate this term in energetic based growth models.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about a specific deep learning model being used. However, it discusses the application of a clustering methodology to analyze gaping data from various bivalve species and locations. This suggests that the purpose of the model might be related to pattern recognition, classification, or prediction within the context of bivalve behavior and physiological processes. More specifically, the goal seems to be improving bioenergetic models by incorporating factors such as valve movements, clearance rates, and respiration rates, all of which are inherently linked with gaping. By applying this clustering methodology across different species and locations, researchers aim to enhance their understanding of the consequences of gaping changes and develop indices that can be extrapolated to use gaping directly in the models. Ultimately, this work aims to support both aquaculture practices and management measures, including the allocation of space for aquaculture and the quantification of ecosystem functioning and services associated with aquaculture and natural populations.
