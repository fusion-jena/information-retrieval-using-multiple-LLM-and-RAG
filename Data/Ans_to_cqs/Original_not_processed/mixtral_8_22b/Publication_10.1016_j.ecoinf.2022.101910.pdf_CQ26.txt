et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of machine learning models.
