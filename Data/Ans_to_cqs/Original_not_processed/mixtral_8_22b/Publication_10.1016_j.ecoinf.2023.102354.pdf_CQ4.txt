ficient evidence to the response of the basin to climatic forcings. This is 
bearing in mind that a poor groundwater-based response could lead to 
long-term drought and the annihilation of many aquatic and endangered 
species that rely on the GAB's groundwater resources (e.g., Barron et al., 
2011). Additionally, some innovative techniques have been employed to 
evaluate groundwater-related aspects, such as changes in groundwater 
levels across seasons (Pandey et al., 2020) and identifying the potential 
for  groundwater  availability  using  factors  such  as  geological  charac-
teristics and land use (Kumar et al., 2023), which shows the significance 
of groundwater assessment in areas (e.g., India) where water resources 
are crucial for sustainability and livelihood which directly or indirectly 
aligns with the objectives of our study (Kumar et al., 2023; Pandey et al., 
2020).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the linear interpolation technique to fill up missing data based on subsequent months. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. But there is no mention of these techniques being applied in this case.
