sounds  that  satisfied  the  signal  parameters  introduced  and  saved  the 
output.

2.6. Statistical analyses

Acoustic  data  analyses  were  carried  out  using  Kaleidoscope  Pro 
5.4.7, which is an automated signal recognition software able to analyze 
large acoustic datasets. Kaleidoscope extracts sounds of interest based 
on the following five parameters: minimum and maximum signal length 
(s),  minimum  and  maximum  frequency  range  (Hz),  and  maximum 
intersyllable gap (ms). The maximum intersyllable gap represents the 
maximum distance between sounds to be considered part of the same 
vocalization. To identify representative parameters of the song of the 
Nighthawk we characterized 67 songs using all recordings uploaded in 
Xeno-canto and recorded in the State of Mato Grosso (eight recordings, 
see Supplemental Table S1). Song parameters were characterized from 
spectrograms  using  Raven  Pro  1.5  (Bioacoustics  Research  Program, 
2014). The signal parameters introduced in Kaleidoscope were: 900 and 
1500 Hz (minimum and maximum frequency, respectively); 4 and 30 s

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for identifying Nighthawk vocalizations. However, it mentions the use of Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software capable of analyzing large acoustic datasets. This tool extracts sounds of interest based on five parameters: minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. These parameters help characterize the Nighthawk's song from spectrograms using Raven Pro 1.5. While the text does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, these methods could potentially be employed during preprocessing or training stages to improve model performance. Nevertheless, without further details about the deep learning pipeline, it remains uncertain whether such techniques have been implemented.
