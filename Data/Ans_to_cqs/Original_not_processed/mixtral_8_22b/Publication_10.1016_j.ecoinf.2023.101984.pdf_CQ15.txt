Table 3 
The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there isn't enough information to determine which specific optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during the training process by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. Without further details about the deep learning pipeline used in this research, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique was employed.
