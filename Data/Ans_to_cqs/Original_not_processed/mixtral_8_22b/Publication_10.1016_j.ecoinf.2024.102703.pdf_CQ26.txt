2.2. Field sampling and sample collection 

Four  field  campaigns  were  conducted  in  November  2018,  and 
January, April, and July 2019, under clear weather conditions except in 
July. A total of 119 water samples were collected (Fig. 1). Surface water 
(0.5 m depth) was gathered using clean polyethylene bags and promptly 
transported to the laboratory for analysis. The samples were categorized 
into two groups: one portion was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter 
for water quality parameter analysis, while the other was prepared for 
CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. This involved filtering through a 
◦
C, 3 h) Whatman GF/F filter and a 0.2 μm Millipore 
precombusted (450 
filter, followed by storage in 150 mL acid-washed amber glass bottles.

The  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
proposed  an  alternative  classification  system  in  1982,  utilizing 
chlorophyll-a  (Chl-a),  Secchi  disk  depth  (SDD),  and  total  phosphorus 
(TP) concentration (Caspers, 1984). To improve the sensitivity of con-
ventional  classifications,  Carlson  (1977)  proposed an  altered  method. 
However,  because  these  systems  were  dependent  on  laboratory  in-
dicators and were susceptible to outside influences, trophic state eval-
uations  were  susceptible  to  manipulation.  Additionally,  traditional 
methodologies did not take watercolor’s effect on eutrophication into 
account. When the concentration of humic substances in the lake is high, 
causing  browning,  it  will  affect  underwater  light  intensity,  thereby 
influencing the growth of phytoplankton. As a result, a novel approach 
to nutritional status prediction is required, one with higher spatiotem-

creases. This study implies that DOM absorption and humification can 
be used to predict the nutrient status of lakes and rivers in a plateau.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights regarding this topic.

Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using various techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target classes in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic examples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. While this may lead to loss of valuable information, it can help reduce overfitting and improve model performance.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from different sources or demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help mitigate bias caused by limited or skewed datasets.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of the dataset's characteristics and appropriate use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
