et al., 2008; Jewell et al., 2020); giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca (Li 
et al., 2018); Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra, and other otter species (Kistner 
et al., 2022); cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus (Jewell et al., 2016); mountain 
lion, Puma concolor (Alibhai et al., 2017); and Amur tiger, Panthera tigris 
altaica  (Alibhai  et  al.,  2023).  FIT  develops  a  classification  algorithm 
based on a training dataset of footprints of known species, sex, or in-
dividuals.  In  previous  applications,  FIT  training  datasets  have  been 
based on collecting sequences of footprints (trails) in natural substrates 
from  captive  or  free  ranging  animals  of  known  identity  to  develop  a 
training  dataset  (Alibhai  et  al.,  2008).  However,  for  some  species, 
ground conditions make collecting high quality tracks in natural sub-
strate difficult (habitat in forest littler or heavy vegetation) and/or lack 
accessible  captive  populations.  Here  we  report  the  development  of  a

To identify variables with the greatest potential to discriminate be-
tween classes of objects (e.g., species or fisher sex) we used a predictor 
screening analysis that uses bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the 
contribution  of  predictors  on  the  response  object.  For  each  response 
object  we  employed  predictor  screening  using  1000  decision  trees  to 
evaluate all 124 potential FIT metrics. We then used the top predictor 
variables to evaluate the dataset for two potential sources of bias, 1) the 
use of mirrored right front tracks instead of only left front tracks (foot 
position  bias)  and  2)  the  potential  for  bias  between  observers  when 
manually  marking  the  landmark  points  in  the  FIT  interface (observer 
bias) which is a somewhat subjective process. Foot position (left-front or 
right-front) of each track was recorded for each track during the feature 
extraction  process.  To  evaluate  observer  bias  we  had  3  different  ob-

We  used  a  stepwise  variable  selection  procedure  with  the  p-value 
serving as the decisive factor (threshold of 0.05) to select the variables 
that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. We used 
linear  discriminant  analysis  to  generate  a  discrimination  line  (2  vari-
ables) or hyperplane (>3 variables) depending on the number of vari-
ables  in  the  resulting  model  to  classify  species  or  sex.  To  quantify 
uncertainty  in  classification,  we  then  generated  bands  of  uncertainty 
around  this  discrimination  hyperplane.  We  assigned  values  that  fall 
within these bands a probability value (p) indicating a level of certainty 
about the classification using a logistic regression model, as in Eq. (1)
