Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the crawling tool was developed to gather historical and near real-time data from different Sentinel-3 related products. The data includes various parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, and more. These datasets can be utilized for training machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines.

Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and others. These methods help increase the size of the dataset artificially, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which specific data augmentation techniques were employed in this case.
