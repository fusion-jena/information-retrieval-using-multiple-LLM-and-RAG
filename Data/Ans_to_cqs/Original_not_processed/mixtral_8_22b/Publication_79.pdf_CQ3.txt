Helpful Answer:

The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. However, based on common practices and related works mentioned in the text, we can infer some possible methods.

One commonly used technique is semantic segmentation, which involves assigning a label or category to each pixel in an image. This method is employed by Neves et al. [26] using high spatial resolution satellite data and U-Net architecture [27]. Semantic segmentation allows for precise delineation of vegetation patterns, including different tree heights.

Instance segmentation is another potential technique, where individual objects within an image are identified and labeled separately. Although this method is not explicitly mentioned in the context, it could be useful for identifying distinct features such as scattered shrub detection [22], endangered tree species [24], or other unique elements within the savanna landscape.

Bounding box annotation is also a popular technique, often used for object detection tasks. While not directly discussed in the context, it may have been applied in previous studies involving deep learning for detecting tree crowns [23, 24]. Bounding boxes help localize and identify specific objects within images, providing valuable input for training deep learning models.

In summary, while the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying Brazilian Savanna physiognomies are not specified in the given context, common practices suggest that semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and bounding box annotations might have been utilized. These techniques enable accurate identification and classification of various vegetation patterns and land cover types present in the savanna ecosystem.
