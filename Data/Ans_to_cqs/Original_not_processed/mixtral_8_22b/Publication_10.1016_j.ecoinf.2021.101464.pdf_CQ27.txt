3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

(RF) model, and the results are shown in Fig. 4, which shows that the 
RMSE between the measured and fitting values is 146.202 and 117.430 
ion/cm3, and  the  linear correlation  R2  is  0.275 and  0.980,  indicating 
that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect. 
In addition, to further verify the model’s stability, independent test data 
were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation, and the results 
are shown in Table 5. For that test, the average R2  was 0.931 and the 
average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, reaffirming that the RF model has 
high simulation accuracy and good stability.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed answer about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be observed that the random forest (RF) model was implemented using R statistical software (Team RDC, 2010), but no specific details regarding deployment or platform selection have been mentioned.

It should also be noted that the text does not mention any deep learning models being used, only a random forest model. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model based on this context.
