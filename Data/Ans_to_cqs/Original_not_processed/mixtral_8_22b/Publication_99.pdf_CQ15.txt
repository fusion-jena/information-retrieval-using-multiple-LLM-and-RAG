applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model. 

3.4. Performance evaluation

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss. 

3.3.2. Pix2Pix network

Training GANs is challenging as both generator and discriminator are 
competing and hence expected to reach at equilibrium (Pan et al., 2019). 
In this study, all Pix2Pix models were trained for 50 epochs. After every 
500 iterations, the performance of the generator models were evaluated 
using  both  Structural  Similarity  Index  Measure  (SSIM)  and  the  Peak 
Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics and the model was saved as the 
best  model  if  it  has  improved  the  performance  on  the  validation  set 
compared to previous iterations.

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, several optimization techniques are mentioned for different deep learning pipelines.

For the PConv networks, the Adam optimizer is employed with a learning rate of 0.0002. Similarly, the Pix2Pix networks also use the Adam optimizer but with a lower learning rate of 9e-5.

When it comes to the classification networks, they too utilize the Adam optimizer. However, their learning rates differ depending on the specific task. For instance, the learning rate for the pre-trained networks is 0.03, while the networks trained from scratch use a learning rate of 0.0002.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were optimized using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. It combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp, making it suitable for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data.

Therefore, the primary optimization technique applied in these deep learning pipelines is the Adam optimizer, with varying learning rates tailored to each specific application.
