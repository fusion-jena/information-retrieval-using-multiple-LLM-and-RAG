Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in the field, it can be assumed that the authors might have made their code publicly accessible through popular version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out if this is the case, one could search for the relevant papers by Ibrahim et al. (2018) and Kahl et al. (2021) on these platforms or check the respective paper's supplementary materials section for any links to the source code repositories. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the project or its authors, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the location of the code repository.
