Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2. Data 

The data used here was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Chal-
lenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe

4.3. The prediction task

In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, which could potentially help mitigate some forms of bias by optimizing model performance. Additionally, the use of Convolutional LSTM networks suggests that temporal and spatial patterns in the data may have been considered, which can also help reduce certain types of biases. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the preprocessing steps taken, it cannot be definitively stated what techniques were employed to address data bias.
