these methods. By applying random erasing to the training dataset of the 
EfficientNet, performance was also moderately improved (Table 6).

To re-identify the candidate regions, we inputted outputs from the 
YOLOv4  into  the  EfficientNet.  As  mentioned  above,  there  were  eight 
types of the EfficientNet. Starting from the baseline EfficientNet-B0, the 
baseline network was scaled up from EfficientNet-B1 to B7 based on the

capacity  over  various  benchmark  datasets  by  adopting  a  compound 
scaling method that enlarges the network depth, width, and resolution. 
In  addition,  we  proposed  a  data  augmentation  method  to  train  the 
two-stage CNNs as a generally applicable model under various camera or 
field conditions.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. They used diverse datasets, which included different types of EfficientNet models ranging from B0 to B7. These models were scaled up based on capacity over various benchmark datasets using a compound scaling method that enlarged the network depth, width, and resolution. Additionally, they proposed a data augmentation method to train the two-stage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), aiming to create a generally applicable model under various camera or field conditions. This approach likely helped improve the robustness and adaptability of the model across different scenarios. However, it is not explicitly stated whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the development process.
