research  on  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Traditional  linear  program-
ming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic 
algorithms  (GA),  particle  swarm  optimization  algorithms,  and  deep 
learning have achieved great success in both theoretical and practical 
applications. Mohammadi (2023) modeled various drought timescales 
by  combining  artificial  neural  networks  with  firefly  algorithms. 
Emamgholizadeh  et  al.  (2023)  used  enhanced  machine  learning 
methods to predict soil cation exchange capacity in the southern region 
of China. Ghezelbash et al. (2023a) combined the GA and firefly opti-
mization  algorithm  with  the  K-means  clustering  method  for  copper- 
related geochemical footprints of porphyry and skarn in the Baft area 
of Kerman, Iran, and achieved good research results. Ghezelbash et al. 
(2023b) added GA to K-means and SVM to construct GIS-based mineral 
prospecting maps, and the results showed that the SVM model based on

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the study. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework.
