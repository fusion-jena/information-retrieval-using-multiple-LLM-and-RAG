Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

However, for machine learning algorithms like backpropagation to 
be successful, a critical condition must be met: all functions involved 
must be differentiable to compute gradients accurately. As said above, 
to make the update criterion differentiable, we use the Gumbel softmax 

function.  So,  by  changing  our  update  criterion  to 

̃
Uk,  we  manage  to 

compute the gradients. 

This new data-driven architecture aims to learn the neighbourhood 
relationship Rk to improve the results of our model. In addition, learning 
the  neighbourhood  relationship  has  value  in  itself,  as  it  allows  us  to 
know and learn how the different elements of the system interact. For 
this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 13 a neural network ANN (or other 
objects) might be defined as Rk, which may take two kinds of inputs:

The Gumbel-Softmax  function is  a  more general  function  that can 
approximate any discrete distribution to a continuous distribution. Its 
usefulness in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables, 
such as those used in reinforcement learning and generative models, can 
be seen in (Mena et al., 2018; Strypsteen and Bertrand, 2021). However, 
the Gumbel-Softmax function is not a perfect substitute for the binary 
Bernoulli  random  variable.  Since  the  introduction  of  a  stochastic 
element into the computational process allows us to keep that character, 
but it could have an impact on our estimates. Furthermore, the function

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, it cannot be determined what these values were set to.
