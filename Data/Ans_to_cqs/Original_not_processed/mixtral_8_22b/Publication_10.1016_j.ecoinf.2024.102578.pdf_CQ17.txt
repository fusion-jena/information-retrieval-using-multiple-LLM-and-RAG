shown to reduce the processing time of image classification load by as

3.2. Image quality classification: Training dataset and model training 

Using the manual classifications, we randomly selected images from 
each site, camera, and year, to obtain ~15,000 images of Bad quality 
and  ~  57,000  images  of  Good  quality  for  each  location  (Finnmark 
2016–2018 and 2020–2021 and Yamal 2017–2021). These images were 
then  reexamined  by  GC  and  DE,  and  any  misclassified  images  were 
removed or reclassified. We also excluded marginal images (e.g., partly 
blurred images, images where an animal is only visible with a tail in a

mark  and  Yamal  (N),  together  with  median  and  mean  (standard  deviation) 
percentage of images for each individual camera trap per year. The total dataset 
(workflow development and independent validation) comprised 36 cameras at 5 
sites for 6 years in Finnmark and 9 or 10 cameras for 6 years in Yamal.

Separate  two-class  models  were  trained  for  Finnmark  and  Yamal 
using  the  keras  package  in  R  (Allaire  and  Chollet,  2023)  with  a  Ten-
sorFlow  backend (Allaire  and Tang,  2023).  Preliminary trials  showed 
that region-specific models performed better. The ResNet-50 architec-
ture, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep (He et al., 
2015), was used to train the models with 55 epochs (number of times the 
algorithm goes through the entire training data set) and a batch size of 
64  (number  of  samples  to  work  through  before  updating  model  pa-
rameters)  with  a  one-cycle  learning  rate  (hyperparameter  controlling 
model  response  to  estimated  error  each  time  the  model  weights  are 
updated) policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 
(Smith, 2018).

2. Workflow 

The multi-step, semi-automated workflow proposed here (Fig. 1) is 
adapted from B¨ohner et al., 2023, including pre-processing of images, 
model  training,  classification,  manual  quality  checks,  and  final  data 
formatting. Specifically, we build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) 
and  Fennell  et  al.  (2022),  who  combined  MegaDetector  with  manual 
classification and custom-trained models. The workflow consists of the 
following two classification steps in addition to pre-processing of images 
and  final  manual  inspection,  quality  control,  and  data  formatting 
(Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout involves temporarily removing random neurons during training to prevent complex co-adaptations between them. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. Early stopping stops training when performance on a validation set starts degrading. Data augmentation generates new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to existing ones. It is possible that these or other methods may have been employed but not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
