applied.  All  input  images  were  preprocessed  by  mean  centering  the 
image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Since 
our dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning 
rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam 
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Table 2 summarizes the parameter 
used for training each model. 

3.4. Performance evaluation

The original implementation of PConv network required a two-phase 
training process (Liu et al., 2018). This is because the generated holes 
presented  a  problem  for  batch  normalization  layer  when  computing 
mean  and  variance  of  the  hole  pixels.  In  this  study,  all  models  were 
trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer 
in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small 
batch size of 1. The models were optimized using Adam optimizer with a 
learning rate of 0.0002 while using relu activation for encoder part and 
leakyRelu  activation  for  the  decoder  part  of  the  network.  All  models 
were  trained  for  50  epochs.  For  each  training  epoch,  a  model  was 
evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based 
on a validation loss.

ments.  Since  all  networks  used  present  different  architectural  setups, 
different training procedures have been discussed. Each category of a 
CNN  (i.e.  PConv  networks,  Pix2Pix  networks  and  classification  net-
works)  consisted  of  multiple  trained  models  so  the  same  training

3.3.3. Classification 

Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated 
to perform well on various plant species identification tasks (Pang and 
Lim,  2019).  To  train  our  classification  model,  we  adapted  the  vgg16 
network  pre-trained  on  ImageNet  dataset  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman, 
2014). The fully connected layers of the networks were replaced with a 
global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 as a 
network regularizer and single hidden layer with a total of 256 units for 
a larger image sized model(512 × 512) and 128 units for a smaller image 
size model (256 × 256). Both networks were trained for 20 epochs with 
a  batch  size  of 32  and  various data augmentation  techniques such as 
height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were taken during their development and training processes. These include:

1. Preprocessing of Input Images: All input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. This step helps in reducing the impact of variations in lighting conditions and other irrelevant features, thereby improving the model's ability to learn relevant patterns.

2. Balanced Dataset: The dataset used for training the models was balanced, which means it had equal representation of samples from each class. A balanced dataset ensures that the model does not get biased towards any particular class, thus enhancing its generalizability.

3. Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Both networks were trained with a learning rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam optimizer. Cross-entropy loss is widely used in multi-class classification problems and has proven effective in achieving good performance across diverse datasets.

4. Data Augmentation Techniques: Various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Data augmentation helps in preventing overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

5. Freezing Batch Normalization Layers: During the training of PConv networks, the batch normalization layer in the encoder part was frozen as the network used pre-trained weights with a small batch size of 1. This measure prevents the batch statistics from being affected by the presence of missing or corrupted regions in the input images, ensuring stable training and better generalization.

6. Model Evaluation Using Validation Set: For each training epoch, a model was evaluated using the validation set and was saved as the best model based on a validation loss. Regularly evaluating the model on a separate validation set allows monitoring its performance on unseen data and selecting the most robust model for final deployment.

These measures collectively contribute to enhancing the generalizability of the deep learning models developed in this study.
