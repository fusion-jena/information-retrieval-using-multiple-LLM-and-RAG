Our results suggest that certain plant functional traits can be retrieved from simple RGB photographs. The key 
for this trait retrieval are deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks in concert with Big Data derived 
from open and citizen science projects. Although these models are subject to some noise, there is a wealth of 
applications for this approach, such as global trait maps, monitoring of trait shifts in time and the identification 
of large-scale ecological gradients. This way, the problem of limited data that still impedes us to picture global 
 gradients7 could be alleviated by harnessing the exponentially growing iNaturalist  database16. The performance 
of the CNN models across traits varied strongly, but revealed a clear trend: As expected, the more a trait referred 
to morphological features, the more accurate the predictions were. The models of the Baseline setup explained a

Nevertheless, our results indicate that exploiting a Big Data approach is viable to reveal macroecological trait 
patterns, maybe because the most striking species of an ecosystem are likely to suffice in describing its func-
tional  footprint5. Since the strong growth of the iNaturalist database leads to a steadily increasing geographic 
coverage, the representativeness of these data is likely to grow as well. A recent study investigating the records 
of  FloraIncognita12, a citizen-science and deep learning-based application for identifying plant species from 
photographs, suggested that such crowd-sourced data can reproduce primary dimensions in plant community 
 composition41. This underlines the future potential of harnessing citizen science databases for identifying these 
patterns. Here, we demonstrated the practical value and applicability of the CNN models by producing GTDM

Conclusion and outlook
Following the urgently needed transition of ecology towards a data-sharing scientific  discipline15,44 and the call for 
integration of powerful datasets in  ecology44, we built upon this revolution of Big Data provided by professional 
and citizen science alike. Therefore, we exploited the potential of Convolutional Neural  Networks44 to produce 
generic models generalising across all biomes and regions around the globe to extract a set of plant functional 
traits from simple RGB photographs. Thus, the burden of limited geographical coverage of trait databases might 
be lifted by the worldwide coverage of the iNaturalist plant photograph database. The traits referring to the models 
with the highest predictive performance cover the primary axes of plant form and function 13, which are plant and 
organ size (GH, LA) as well as the leaf economics spectrum (SLA). Despite of the disputable model performance
