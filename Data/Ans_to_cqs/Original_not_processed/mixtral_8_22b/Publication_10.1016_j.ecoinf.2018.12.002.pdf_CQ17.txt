(Breiman, 2001). Furthermore, support vector machines use determi-
nistic approaches to choosing points or support vectors to deﬁne the
boundary between classes. Although the deterministic approach may
reduce the computational cost and time, support vector machines are a
binary, one-vs-all-other classiﬁer. Support vector machines need to be
applied n times to a data set if there are n behavioral categories. The
high overall performance of random forests or ensemble machine
learning will allow us to understand the behavior of cryptic animals
using ACC data (Brewster et al., 2018; Ladds et al., 2017). Although
random forests are a leading machine learning algorithm with im-
pressive overall performance in behavioral classiﬁcation, random forest
and its derivatives may not perform consistently among all behavioral
categories (Brewster et al., 2018; Nathan et al., 2012). Therefore,

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention some relevant concepts related to machine learning and modeling.

Random Forests is mentioned as a popular machine learning algorithm that can help reduce the variance of a model without increasing its bias (Breiman, 2001). Random Forests works by creating multiple decision trees and aggregating their results, which helps improve the accuracy and stability of the model. While this technique is not explicitly referred to as a regularization method, it shares similarities with techniques like bagging and boosting, which aim to reduce overfitting by combining multiple models.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are also discussed briefly. They use a deterministic approach to choose points or support vectors to define boundaries between classes. While SVMs are not specifically described as a regularization method, they do incorporate a concept called margin maximization, which aims to find the largest possible distance between the separating hyperplane and the training samples. This can be seen as a form of implicit regularization, helping to prevent overfitting by finding a more generalizable solution.

Although the provided context does not directly address the specific regularization methods mentioned in the query (dropout and L2 regularization), it does touch upon related concepts within the broader field of machine learning and modeling.
