the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

• I.H255.H255: The neural network was pre-trained
on the generalist dataset ImageNet to initialize the
weights, fine-tuned on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

Herbarium specimen classification
These experiments aim at assessing the feasibility of using
a deep learning system dedicated to herbarium specimen
identification at a realistic scale (255 species from Costa-
Rica in Herbarium255 and 1K species from France in
Herbarium1K). Herbarium255 was divided in 70% train-
ing data and the rest 30% as test data used for computing
the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Herbarium1K
was divided in 80 and 20% respectively, to keep the pro-
portion of the data provided by the PC challenge. The
separation was done by species, and within each species,

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: top-1 and top-5 accuracies. These metrics measure how well the model can correctly identify the correct species or classes among the given options. Top-1 accuracy refers to the percentage of cases where the model accurately predicts the exact species or class, while top-5 accuracy considers the prediction successful if the actual species or class appears within the top five predicted labels. In this study, the top-1 and top-5 accuracies were computed for both Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K datasets to assess the feasibility of using a deep learning system for herbarium specimen identification.
