However,  although  research  on  the  urban  AE  gained  traction  in 
recent years, sophisticated methods to quantify its complex properties 
on  a  larger  scale  are  still  scarce.  This  is  especially  true  for  big  audio 
datasets, which are so extensive that listening to the files becomes no 
longer  feasible.  To  date,  few  approaches  have  been  used  to  quantify 
large datasets of the urban AE. Classical approaches reach their limits 
when  it  comes  to  analyzing  longer  recording  periods  (e.g.  several 
months) (Gage et al., 2017). In recent years, sound event classification 
using  machine  learning  approaches  became  more  popular  (Phillips 
et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018), 
but is still not ready to be deployed unconfined (Alcocer et al., 2022). In 
psychoacoustics, mostly smaller field studies have been conducted (Hall 
et  al.,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2021;  Montoya-Belmonte  and  Navarro,  2020;

every step from the FCM, to thresholding, to the adjacency matrix and its 
respective network representation.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label various types of objects or regions within images or videos, enabling models to learn patterns and relationships between them. The choice of technique depends on the specific task and dataset being used.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the study involves analyzing large datasets of urban acoustic environments using machine learning approaches such as sound event classification. While this doesn't directly relate to image or video analysis, similar principles apply when working with audio data. Annotations might involve identifying different sounds or events within recordings, allowing models to classify them accurately. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the specific methodology employed in this study, we cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques utilized.
