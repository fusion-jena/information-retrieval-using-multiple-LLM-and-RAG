In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

in Fig. 2. 

The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

The Apriori algorithm consists of a sequence of steps for identifying 
the most frequent itemset in a given database (Fig. 2). Two main pro-
cesses  are  performed  iteratively  to  locate  the  most  frequent  itemsets: 
joining and pruning. As the name indicates, join represents the union of 
itemsets,  and  pruning  is  a  data  compression  technique  in  machine 
learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by 
removing  sections  of  the  tree  that  are  non-critical  and  redundant  to 
classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier 
and  improves  the  predictive  accuracy  by  reducing  overfitting  (Zhao 
et al., 2009).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct mention of addressing data bias specifically during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights into common techniques used to handle data bias in such scenarios. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified Splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target classes in both subsets. It helps ensure that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes, thus mitigating potential biases caused by imbalanced datasets.

Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples compared to others. By duplicating examples from the minority class, this approach aims to balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class. A popular oversampling technique is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates new synthetic samples instead of simply duplicating existing ones.

Undersampling: Undersampling is another strategy employed to tackle imbalanced datasets. Unlike oversampling, undersampling focuses on removing examples from the majority class until it reaches a balanced state with the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple yet effective undersampling method that randomly removes samples from the majority class.

Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial to minimize biases introduced due to limited representation in the dataset. Ensuring that the collected data covers different demographics, geographical locations, or other relevant factors can help create a more robust and unbiased model.
