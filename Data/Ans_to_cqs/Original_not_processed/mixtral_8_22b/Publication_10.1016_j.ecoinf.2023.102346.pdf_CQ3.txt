(Phillips et al., 2006). To ensure the processing of both continuous and 
categorical  discrete  values  in  the  metadata,  selected  algorithms  with 
regression and classification prediction tasks were used. Mapping fore-
casts of different algorithms in the ensemble approach were evaluated 
by assessing the accuracy and performance of the final models.

The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention or discussion about specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The focus of the provided information seems to be more on the use of various machine learning algorithms and their evaluation metrics rather than the preprocessing steps like data annotation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this particular case.
