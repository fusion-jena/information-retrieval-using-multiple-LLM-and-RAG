2022) conducted a study that proposed a Convolutional Neural Network 
model  to  identify  the  plant  species.  The  five  medicinal  plants  of  750 
image samples are collected using a box model that is subjected to initial 
preprocessing of resize, segmentation, and augmentation to increase the 
sample size. (Malik et al., 2022) proposed a deep learning-based method 
to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. The chal-
lenges associated with real-time image acquisition conditions must be 
meticulously addressed to improve the accuracy of the real-time clas-
sification systems. In recognizing multiple disease varieties in a single 
crop,  a  few  significant  contributions  reported  include  deep  learning 
models  by  (Wang  et  al.,  2022;  Bi  et  al.,  2022;  Sennan  et  al.,  2022;

not the primary focus of this work, and also considered high-resolution 
images for classification tasks. In a recent study (Chulif et al., 2023), 
deep  learning  models  are  used  for  detecting  diseases  in  single  crop 
species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisi-
tion.  In  a  different  work  (Barhate  et  al.,  2023),  VGG-16  and  dimen-

species  with  hyperparameter  tuned  and  batch  updated  stochastic

ResNet-50  architecture  to  capture  the  leaf  feature  patterns  via  fusion

effectiveness of the model. The aforementioned studies do not directly

of the proposed model towards new real-time datasets without a con-
strained image acquisition setup. In the future, increasing the number of 
samples  and  including  a  pre-processing  method  to  remove  complex 
backgrounds  will  further  improve  the  performance  of  the  proposed 
model.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research papers mentioned primarily use images as their input format for the deep learning pipelines. Specifically, they utilize high-resolution images of various plant leaves for classification purposes. These images undergo several preprocessing steps such as resizing, segmentation, and augmentation before being fed into the deep learning models like CNN, ResNet-50, or VGG-16. While other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files may be relevant for different applications, these specific studies only mention the usage of image data.
