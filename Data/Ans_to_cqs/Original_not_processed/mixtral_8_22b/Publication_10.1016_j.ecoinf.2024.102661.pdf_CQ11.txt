Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly
