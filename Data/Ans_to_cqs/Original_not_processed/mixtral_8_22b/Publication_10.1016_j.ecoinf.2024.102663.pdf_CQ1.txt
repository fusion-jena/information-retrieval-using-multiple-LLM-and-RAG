Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  deep  learning  techniques  to  pre-
processing under extreme conditions such as low light, extreme occlu-
sion, or overlapping of fish can address unique challenges by tailoring 
datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these 
datasets. Incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe (Abualigah et al., 
2024; Chen et al., 2020) embeddings could enhance the detection and 
classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and 
semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass esti-
mates. Continuing to modify the architecture of deep learning models 
like YOLO, to better suit specific requirements, includes altering various 
parts of the architecture as needed to handle different environmental 
factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

1. Introduction 

Fish biomass estimation is essential for the fisheries and aquaculture 
industries  (Li  et  al.,  2020).  Manual  methods  of  estimation  can  be 
strenuous for the fish. Thus, there is a need for non-intrusive methods of 
fish  biomass  estimation.  Biomass  estimation  in  a  turbid  environment 
also comes with several challenges. This is where deep learning can play 
a  vital  role.  Training  a  deep  learning  model  on  large  datasets  of  fish 
images  can  provide  accurate  biomass  estimates  without  causing  un-
necessary  strain  to  the  fish  and  minimizes  manual  effort.  Hence,  the 
motivation of this research lies in providing an efficient, precise, and 
cost-effective  method  for  estimating  fish  biomass  in  turbid  environ-
ments. The reliance on fishing and aquaculture is a prominent charac-
teristic of numerous societies, playing a substantial role in bolstering the 

economic and social vitality of various nations and locations.

deep  learning-based  methods  (Abinaya  et  al.,  2022).  Barbedo,  2022 
detailed employing computer vision and artificial intelligence-based fish 
monitoring and recognition methods. Biomass statistics are computed in 
sea  cages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021).  However,  by  applying  image  processing 
techniques, such as object detection and segmentation, it is possible to 
extract fish from the background and calculate their size and biomass. 
By using underwater videos, it is possible to detect the fish present and 
estimate  their  size,  which  can  then  be  used  to  calculate  the  total 
biomass. Overall, formulating the problem of estimating fish biomass in 
turbid  water  using  underwater  videos  provides  a  practical  and  non- 
invasive  solution  for  monitoring  fish  populations  and  managing 
aquatic  ecosystems.  By  carefully calibrating  the  camera  and  applying 
appropriate image processing techniques, it is possible to obtain accu-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the primary source of raw data is likely underwater video footage or images of fish in their natural habitat. These visual data sources would enable the application of image processing techniques like object detection and segmentation, which are mentioned as part of the deep learning pipeline for estimating fish biomass. Additionally, the reference to large datasets of fish images suggests that publicly available datasets may also contribute to the raw data collection process. Nonetheless, further details regarding the specific methods employed for gathering raw data, such as utilizing specialized sensors or conducting surveys, remain undisclosed in the provided context.
