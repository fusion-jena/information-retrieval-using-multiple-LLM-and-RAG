DIVERSIMAR project (@diversimar). This helped us to understand how 
users expressed themselves in this social network. Although many of the 
tweets turned out to be very specific, it was possible to identify three 
fairly common ways of expressing that something interesting had been 
found. Therefore, we decided to perform the tweet search through the 
API  with  three  different  criteria:  (i)  tweets  in  which  users  ask  “who 
knows” or if “anyone knows” what they have found (query 1), (ii) tweets 
that directly ask “what is this” that they have found (query 2) and (iii) 
tweets  from  users  claiming  to  have  found  something,  with  textual 
expression as “I/we have found” (query 3). Different verb tenses were 
also used in each of the expressions, as well as the use of first person in 
both  singular  and  plural.  In  addition,  the  different  criteria  must  be 
accompanied by one of the following words to ensure that they refer to

In this study we have used the ‘Full-archive search endpoint’ to ac-
cess  the  entire  dataset  published  on  Twitter  from  its  beginning  in 
2006–2007 until the end of 2022. To handle the data in JSON format 
returned  by  the  Twitter  API,  we  used  the  twarc2  library  (https:// 
twarc-project.readthedocs.io/).  This  library  simplifies  the  handling  of 
the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API, as well as the pagination 
resulting from a single query. 

The API works by searching for words, hashtags or combinations of 
both  in  the  text  of  tweets,  much  like  the  Twitter  Advanced  Search 
interface  (https://twitter.com/search-advanced?).  To  find  out  how  to 
run the search, in an initial phase of the study, some public tweets with 
observations  were  provided  by  the  social  media  manager  of  the

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. The only tools mentioned are the 'Full-archive search endpoint' of the Twitter API and the 'twarc2' library for handling the returned data in JSON format. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
