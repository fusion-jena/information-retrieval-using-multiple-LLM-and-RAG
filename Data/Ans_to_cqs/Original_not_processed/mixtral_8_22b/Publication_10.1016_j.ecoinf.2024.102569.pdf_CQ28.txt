where species are observed outside of their suitable habitats, such as in 
cultivation or captivity contexts (Botella et al., 2018). These scenarios 
are  common  issues  in  crowdsourcing  data  analysis.  To  remove  such 
heterogeneous  observations,  the  time-consuming  manual  checking  by 
experts  is  required  (Belbin  et  al.,  2013;  Mesibov,  2013).  If  such  pro-
cedure is not fully executed, our proposed method is expected to miti-
gate  the  impact  of  heterogeneous  observations  and  achieve  better 
predictions than ordinary methods. 

In  the  understanding  of  ecological  processes,  there  are  situations

where  extreme  observations  contain 

important

such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on 
the  Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible  for 
use. However, the analysis of PO data from such sources requires special 
attention, compared to PA data obtained through designed surveys, due 
to the potential for issues such as species identification errors and local 
over-aggregation of records.
