Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified splitting, which ensures equal representation of classes; oversampling, where minority class examples are duplicated or synthesized; undersampling, where majority class examples are removed; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples from different sources. These methods help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve overall performance of machine learning models.
