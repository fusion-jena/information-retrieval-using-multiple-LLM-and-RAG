Although the origins of these data ranged from regional to global
sources, they were all consistent in their reproducibility on a global
scale. Climate data for historical and climate change projections is
provided by e.g. WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans, 2017), while a Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 30 m can be acquired from
the Copernicus program (ESA, 2023). The soil type can be found on the
hydrogeological map of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Nat-
ural Resources (Duscher et al., 2015). Vector data on roads and hunting
are available from the OpenStreetMap initiative, whereas landscape
metrics can be determined from ESA CCI land cover maps, as previously
mentioned.

Climate data were used without further processing as representative
of the effects of extreme temperatures and precipitation on rabbit

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various sources of data such as WorldClim for climate data, Copernicus program for DEM, hydrogeological map of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources for soil type, OpenStreetMap initiative for vector data on roads and hunting, and ESA CCI land cover maps for landscape metrics. However, it does not specify any specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
