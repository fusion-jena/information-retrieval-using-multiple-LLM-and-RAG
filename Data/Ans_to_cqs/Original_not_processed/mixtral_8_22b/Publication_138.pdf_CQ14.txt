The pooling operator is connected after this layer for extracting the main features of a certain area, 
reducing the number of parameters, and preventing the model from over fitting. The maximum pooling 
with a 2 × 2 window and 2 strides is used in this layer. The pooling result is the data with the size of 56 
× 56 × 64.  

After pooling, the LRN (Local Response Normalization) is used to normalize the local response. 
The LRN enhances the larger response value and reduce the smaller response value. Thus, the LRN 
also can improve the generalization of the model. The output result of the LRN is the data with the size 
of 56 × 56 × 64.

Figure 7 shows the relation between Min-batch size and Accuracy, Epoches. As we see in Figure 
7(a), when the Min-batch size is 128, the accuracy is the highest. This indicates the Min-batch size is 
relation to the accuracy of algorithm. In Figure 7(b), the larger is the Min-batch size, the larger is the 
number of epochs. When the Min-batch size is more than 256, the number of epochs is sharp large. The 
larger is the number of the epochs, the more is the consumed time when the algorithm converges. We 
also  can  see,  when  the  Min-batch  size  is  128,  the  accuracy  of  algorithm  is  high,  and  the  number  of 
epochs is relatedly small.

We also see that, the more the number of the layers of networks, the larger the min-batch size is. 
But  the  VGG-19  is  just  the  opposite  due  to  its  too  much  layers.  The  inception  module  induces  the 
number  of  parameters  and  computing  cost  of  the  GoogLeNet  and  ICSNet,  and  remains  more  high 
identifying ability.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using techniques like grid search or random search. However, it does show that different values of the min-batch size were tested, which suggests some form of optimization was performed. Unfortunately, without further details about the specific methods used, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another method was employed.
