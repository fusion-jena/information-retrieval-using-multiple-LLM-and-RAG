both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

3. Results

To expand our dataset, we tripled the image pool for each transect by 
incorporating multi-temporal data. By drawing data from a three-month 
span (March, September and October 2015) across three environments, 
we could more effectively train and test deep learning models, which 
inherently  demand  many  images  to  learn  effectively,  however,

Helpful Answer:
The study employs several strategies to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they use a diverse dataset consisting of multi-temporal data drawn from a three-month span across three different environments. This diversity helps the model to better understand and classify various forest types. Secondly, they utilize transfer learning, leveraging the pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, which has been trained on large datasets such as ImageNet. This allows them to apply existing knowledge to their specialized task with limited data. Lastly, they employ a LOGO (Leave-One-Group-Out) cross-validation method. In this approach, one complete 450m multitemporal transect is left out during each iteration of the training process before being tested. This ensures that every multitemporal transect is evaluated, taking into account the constraints of their data and ensuring that the model performs well even when presented with new, unseen data.
