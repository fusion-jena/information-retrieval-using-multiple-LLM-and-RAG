to  the  size  and  number  of  convolution  kernels  and  hyperparameters, 
such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propa-
gation. This dataset encompassed various influencing factors alongside 
an  extensive  drought  propagation  time  series  spanning  from  January 
1950 to December 2020. By employing a sliding window method with a 
window  size  of  30  years  and  a  step  size  of  one  year,  we  successfully 
generated forty-two distinct datasets, each corresponding to a separate

time window. These carefully curated datasets were then used for the 
model training process. This process involved an iterative approach to 
extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model, 
thus enabling the identification and analysis of evolving patterns in the 
weights associated with each specific influencing factor.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class representation. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data to reduce biases inherent in the initial dataset.
