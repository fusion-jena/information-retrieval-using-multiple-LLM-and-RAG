In their review, Ma et al. [26] showed that nearly 200 publications using deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been published in the ﬁeld of remote sensing by early 2019 of which most
focused on land use land cover (LULC) classiﬁcation [28], urban feature extraction [29–31], and
crop detection [32,33]. Deep learning approaches often require a large amount of training data, and
there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches
in the abovementioned remote sensing ﬁelds. Compared with the studies mentioned above, very
few studies using deep learning have focused on trees or forest classiﬁcation [34]. Flood et al. [35]
used a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution
three-band Earth-I imagery. In their research, a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled for training.
The ﬁnal results were pixel-wise and only two types (trees and large shrubs) were mapped. If there are

that is, the tree species training sample and its quality. As long as the tree sample can be measured well
in ﬁeld work, deep learning networks will work well. Further, it is beneﬁcial to collect tree samples
with the aid of crowd sourcing. In terms of the sampled area in species diversity, our method is also
applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the ﬁeld work
or the requirements of species diversity estimation.

6. Conclusions

The results of this study indicate the potential of deep learning methods for applications in
tree species diversity mapping with high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. Our proposed

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly stated within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location where the dataset might be found. However, common repositories for such data include platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to refer to the original source of the context or contact the authors directly for more accurate information about the data repository.
