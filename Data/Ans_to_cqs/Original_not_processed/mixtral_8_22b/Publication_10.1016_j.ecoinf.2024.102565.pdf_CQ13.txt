denoting  a  Gaussian  process  (MacKay,  2003).  During  model  fitting, 
hyperparameters  are  determined  from  the  data  using  methods  like 
maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches, accommoda-
ting diverse datasets with varying complexities (Sun et al., 2022; Wil-
liams and Rasmussen, 2006). Once fitted, GPR enables predictions for 
new  data  points,  offering  both  point  estimates  and  insights  into  pre-
diction uncertainty (MacKay, 2003).

involves  determining  the  number  of  neurons  in  the  hidden  layers 
(Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016).  While  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  does  not 
exist, a commonly employed rule, as shown in Eq. (5), suggests, that H 
denotes the number of neurons in each hidden layer and N represents the 
number of input features (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Hardesty, 2017). 

H = 2 × N + 1

In  crafting  and  assessing  the  models,  MATLAB  programming  soft-
ware (MathWorks, 2021) served as the primary tool. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
architectural details of these algorithms. The objective was to pinpoint 
the most effective algorithm tailored for this particular application by 
scrutinizing each model’s capability to predict TSM concentration solely 
based on wind speed data.

NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

2.4.2. Wind2TSM model 

To achieve the aims of the study, a distinctive model was devised to 
estimate the average concentration of TSM in the lake, utilizing solely 
wind speed as input, we utilized five machine learning methodologies: 
linear regression (LR) as described by Freedman (2009), regression trees 
(RT) from Verhallen and Bus (2010),  support vector machines  (SVM) 
introduced by Cortes and Vapnik (1995), Gaussian process regression 
(GPR) detailed by MacKay (2003), and NN models based on Hardesty

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it is mentioned that during model fitting, hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches. This implies that the choice of hyperparameters may depend on the dataset being used and could vary accordingly. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Neural Networks (NN) as part of the machine learning methodologies, but it does not provide any further information about the specific hyperparameters used within the NN model. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
