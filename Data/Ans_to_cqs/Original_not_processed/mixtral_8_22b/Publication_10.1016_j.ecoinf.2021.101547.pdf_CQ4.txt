The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

other class(es). The network then performs a new round of learning on 
the  mini-batch  of  images—focusing  relatively  more  on  images  with 
higher  loss  scores—and  updates  its  internal  parameters,  before  pro-
ceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A 
full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 
‘epoch’,  and  the  number  of  iterations  per  epoch  is  equal  to  the  total 
number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

Details of the parameters and settings we used for these two training 
stages are summarized in Table 1.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, the text does discuss the use of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for analyzing satellite imagery. Data augmentation is often employed when working with CNNs to increase the variability of input data and improve model performance.

Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to existing images to create new ones. Commonly used techniques include:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to generate new samples. This helps the model become invariant to orientation changes.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by varying degrees to simulate different viewpoints. This improves the model's ability to recognize objects regardless of their angle.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to alter their sizes. This allows the model to better handle variations in object scale during prediction.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along horizontal or vertical axes to mimic spatial displacement. This enhances the model's robustness against positional shifts.

5. Shearing: Images can undergo shear transformation, distorting them without changing their area. This introduces additional geometric variance into the dataset.

While the exact data augmentation techniques utilized in this particular study aren't mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that one or more of these common techniques could have been implemented to enhance the model's performance.
