• Exp.1: to measure the robustness of the methodologies even in the 

presence of few training data,  

• Exp.2: to investigate the performance of the generated models on a 
large dataset where observations are collected under heterogeneous 
weather conditions,  

• Exp.3: to check the reliability of calibration models several months 

after the last training period.

the distribution of values in the training is more similar to the one of the 
test period. However, when LSTM is performing better than VR + SVR, 
the gain in performance is more significant. 

In  terms  of  bias,  the  results  are  good  for  both  NO  and  NO2.  The 
precision of sensors 4005, 4007, 4009, and 4012 is very low for both NO 
and NO2. Sensor 4006 shows a high precision error only for NO. The 
other sensors have very good performances, even reaching the regula-
tory  monitoring  required  performances.  This  is  an  important  result, 
considering that the mean value of the NO concentrations during the test 
period  (17.22  μg/m3)  was  beyond  the  noise  limit  of  the  cell  (18.75 
μg/m3). The mean concentration of NO is low because the test periods 
are during the co-location near the background station which is located 
in a green area far away from the most relevant source of pollution, such 
as road traffic.

of RMSE and MAE higher than 20 and in green the values lower than 8; 
while  the  values  of  MRE  are  in  green  if  lower  than  0.4  and  in  red  if 
higher than 1. In the end, we used green for accuracy higher than 0.9 
and red for values lower than 0.75. In addition, the number of obser-
vations in the training set is reported in the column “train size”, while 
the column “% out of range” shows the number of observations in the 
test set with the value of at least one of the two channels out of the range 
between the minimum and the maximum values of the training set.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, there are various postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers performed several postprocessing tasks, including evaluating the performance of their models using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and Accuracy. These metrics were calculated based on the predictions made by the models on the test datasets. Additionally, they also analyzed the distribution of values in the training and test sets, as well as the precision of individual sensors. They also investigated the impact of weather conditions on the performance of the models. It is not explicitly mentioned whether saliency maps or confusion matrices were used in this study. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these techniques were employed as part of the postprocessing steps.
