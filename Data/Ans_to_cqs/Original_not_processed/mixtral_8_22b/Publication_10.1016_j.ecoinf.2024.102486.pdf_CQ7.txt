Helpful Answer:
The context does not directly address the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation. However, it is a standard practice in machine learning to divide datasets into these subsets for various purposes.

Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

While the exact proportions may vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors, some commonly used splits include 70/15/15%, 80/10/10%, or even 60/20/20%. It is essential to ensure that the splitting is done randomly to maintain the representativeness of each subset.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training usually involve dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. These divisions help improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities.
