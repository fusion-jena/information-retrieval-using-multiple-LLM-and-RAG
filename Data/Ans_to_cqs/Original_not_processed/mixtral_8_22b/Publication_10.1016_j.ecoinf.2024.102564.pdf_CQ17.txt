The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Machine learning methods: Modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest 
of Brazil

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. This results in more robust features being learned, reducing overfitting. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of the penalty can be controlled by adjusting the regularization parameter lambda.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are effective techniques for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout achieves this by ignoring random neurons during training, while L2 Regularization imposes a penalty on large weights, encouraging simpler models.
