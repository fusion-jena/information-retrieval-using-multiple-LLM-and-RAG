%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The optimization techniques mentioned in the context include grid search and random search, but no specific details about their application in this case are available. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
