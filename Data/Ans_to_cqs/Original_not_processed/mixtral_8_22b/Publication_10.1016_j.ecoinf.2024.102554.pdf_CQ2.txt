Beyond obtaining satellite images with high-quality geometric and 
radiometric  information,  many  biogeophysical  parameters  have  been 
obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos 
et  al.,  2019;  Yang  et  al.,  2013).  For  instance,  from  the  spatial  and 
spectral ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer)  sensor,  44  different  standard  data  products  have 
been developed and are classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere 
and  Ocean  products  (Justice  et  al.,  2002).  Moreover,  the  continuous 
development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the crawling tool developed obtains data from NetCDF files, which stands for Network Common Data Form. This file format is commonly used for storing multidimensional scientific data, including satellite imagery data. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline might be using NetCDF files containing satellite imagery data. The mentioned parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, and Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient suggest that the data could be related to oceanography or atmospheric studies.
