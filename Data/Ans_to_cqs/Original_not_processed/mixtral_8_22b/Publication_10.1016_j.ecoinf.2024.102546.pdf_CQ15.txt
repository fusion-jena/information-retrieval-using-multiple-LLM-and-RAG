jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements random crop 
and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly 
with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 
800  × 800  pixels,  which  is  compatible  with  model  architectures  and 
training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of 
each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the 
original image aspect ratio. All models were trained for 40 epochs with 
batch  size  8,  which  could  adequately  converge  based  on  empirical 
observations.

Helpful Answer:
The paper "Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" by Abbeel, Pieter, 2017 does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, other papers mentioned do provide some insights into this topic. For instance, the paper "Imagen editor and editbench: Advancing and evaluating text-guided image inpainting" by Wang, Su, et al., 2023 mentions using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) as an optimizer. Additionally, the note section states that SGD (stochastic gradient descent) is also used as an optimization technique. Therefore, it can be concluded that both AdamW and SGD have been employed as optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.
