Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As it has been proven, ELMs are an important approach for handling and analysing Big
Data as they require the minimum training time relative to the corresponding engineering
learning algorithms. Moreover ELMs do not require ﬁne manipulations to determine their
operating parameters and ﬁnally they can determine the appropriate output weights
towards the most eﬀective resolution of a problem. What is most important, they have
in contrast to corresponding methods which adjust their
the potential to generalize,

performance based solely on their training data set. It is obvious that the emerging use of
ELM in Big Data analysis as well as DELE creates serious prerequisites for complex systems’
development by low-cost machines.

The 10-fold cross validation (10_FCV) is employed in this stage in order to obtain per-
formance indices. Analytical values of the predictive capacity of the DELMF algorithm are
presented in the following Tables 1–3 where a comparison is made with the Spiking Con-
volutional Neural Network (SCNN) algorithm, which was the subject of an earlier research
eﬀort by our team (Demertzis et al., 2017). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve, that is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classiﬁer
system are presented in graphs 4–6. Authors have designed 3 ROC curves. The ﬁrst ROC
curve (Graph 4) represents the underwater sounds, the second curve (Graph 5) indicates
the ﬁshes and ﬁnally the third curve (Graph 6) depicts the mammals. In all simulations

pleted. The LA has no prior knowledge as to how many training observations will be
presented. Unlike other sequential
learning algorithms which have many control
parameters to be tuned, OSELM only requires the number of hidden nodes to be
speciﬁed (Huang et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2006).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, we can infer from the context that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), including Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM), do not require fine manipulation or extensive parameter tuning like some other learning algorithms. This suggests that these models might rely more on inherent properties of the model rather than external stopping conditions such as validation loss plateaus. Nonetheless, without further details about the specific implementation or methodology used, it would be speculative to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
