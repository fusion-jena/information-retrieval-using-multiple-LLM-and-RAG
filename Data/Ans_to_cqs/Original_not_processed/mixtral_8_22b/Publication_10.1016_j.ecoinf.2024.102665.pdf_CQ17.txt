Increasing  the  dimensions  used  in  the  assessment  through  additional 
variables can therefore be useful (Peterson and Evans, 2019). Due to the 
restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as 
other  learning  methods  (Kekolahti  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the  con-
straints (only one incoming connection per node) allow only the nodes 
with the strongest associations to be connected.

average  for  each  cluster  and  associated  site  data  and  as  an  overall 
average across all site data and associated cluster states of a latent factor

other statistics related to the clusters and resulting network (Table S4). 
The cluster analysis was constrained to a maximum of five states with 
a minimum of two, but low purity measures can exclude some candidate 
clusters. The optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in 
each  was  identified  using  an  automated  expectation-  maximization 
process, described above, based on a random walk with 300 steps for

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less sensitive to specific weights in the network. By ignoring certain neurons, the model becomes less dependent on any single feature and learns to generalize better. Dropout is often applied to fully connected layers in neural networks.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing it from fitting too closely to the training data. L2 regularization is commonly used in linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions; and early stopping, which stops the training process before the model starts to overfit the training data. These methods are not explicitly mentioned in the given context but are relevant to the topic.
