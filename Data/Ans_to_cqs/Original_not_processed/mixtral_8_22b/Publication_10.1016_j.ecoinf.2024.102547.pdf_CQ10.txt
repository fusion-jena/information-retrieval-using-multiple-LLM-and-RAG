Our  research  strongly  advocates  for  FDA  as  a  powerful  tool  for 
unraveling ecological intricacies and promoting sustainable practices in 
marine conservation efforts and beyond. By embracing innovative sta-
tistical  methodologies,  we  can  better  address  pressing  environmental 
challenges  and  safeguard  the  biodiversity  and  health  of  our  planet's 
marine resources.

Our study highlights the significant advantage of employing FDA in 
comparison to traditional multivariate statistical methods when inves-
tigating the impact of environmental variations on SSL. Leveraging our 
original  biogeographical  three-dimensional  datasets,  we  have  demon-
strated the capacity of FDA to capture nuanced parameter variations and 
enhance the spatial characterization of SSL by incorporating geographic 
variables. Through the application of FDA techniques, we have showed 
intricate  patterns  and  variations  across  different  variables  at  various 
depths and frequencies, providing insights that are beyond the reach of 
multivariate statistics.
