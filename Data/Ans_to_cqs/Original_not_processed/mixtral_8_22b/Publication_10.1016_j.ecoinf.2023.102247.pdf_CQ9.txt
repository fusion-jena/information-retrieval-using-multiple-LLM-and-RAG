To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

2.6. Climate scenarios 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Pachauri 
et al., 2014) provided multiple Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs)  for  predicting  climate  change  under  different  greenhouse  gas 
emission trajectories. We constructed habitat suitability models of the 
three species under the RCP2.6 (low emission) and RCP8.5 (high emis-
sion)  scenarios  using  the  same  modeling  method  and  with  the  same 
habitat variables described above. The predicted current niche models 
were projected into future climate conditions to identify range shifts in

the present spatial range of the species under two RCPs for 2070.

Habitat in desert and semi-desert ecosystems are especially vulner-
able to climate change because its resources, especially water, are scarce 
(Daneshvar et al., 2019; Evans, 2009). Water resources are a limiting

their  importance  in  providing  suitable  habitats  for  study  species.  To 
avoid overfitting due to collinearity, we checked for Pearson’s correla-
tion among the variables at the present locations. Finally, we kept Bio1, 
Bio3, Bio4, Bio7, Bio12, Bio15, Bio17, Bio18, DR (Distance to River), 
DRO (Distance to Roads), DH (Distance to Human settlement) and NDVI 
(Fig. S1).
