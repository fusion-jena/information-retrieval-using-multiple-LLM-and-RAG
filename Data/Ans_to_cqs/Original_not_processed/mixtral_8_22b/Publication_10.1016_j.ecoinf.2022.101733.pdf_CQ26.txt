according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

sample’s class proportions are typical of the landscape’s real class pro-
portions. The analyst must make methodological decisions that present 
tradeoffs  in  data  quality  (i.e.,  class  representativeness)  and  quantity

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that careful sample selection was performed to ensure that the sample's class proportions were representative of the landscape's real class proportions. This suggests that some form of stratified sampling or diverse data collection may have been employed to maintain class balance and prevent any potential biases due to overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes. Additionally, the mention of trade-offs between data quality and quantity while creating training data implies that considerations such as oversampling or undersampling might also have been taken into account during the preprocessing stage. Nevertheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated which specific techniques were utilized to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
