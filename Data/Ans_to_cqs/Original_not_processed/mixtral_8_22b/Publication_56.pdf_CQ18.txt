unit reads the input xt , and the previous hidden state ht−1 . Their combination is modulated by an hyperbolic 
tangent as:

˜ct = tanh(Wcxt + Ucht−1 + bc),
(1)
where Wc , Uc , and bc are the input weights, the recurrent weights, and the bias, respectively. The input gate 
determines which information is stored in the memory cell by means of a sigmoid function:

it = σ (Wixt + Uiht−1 + bi),

and similarly, the forget gate decides which content of the existing memory cell is forgotten:

ft = σ (Wf xt + Uf ht−1 + bf ).

The information is updated into the memory cell by adding the information coming from both the input and 
forget gates, i.e., adding new information from ct , and rules out part of the current memory information:

the relevance of predictors in the classification process leading to an improved understanding of 
the behaviour of the network. The conducted analysis demonstrates that the red and near infrared 
Sentinel‑2 bands convey the most useful information. With respect to the temporal information, the 
features derived from summer acquisitions were the most influential. These results contribute to the 
understanding of models used for decision making in the CAP to accomplish the European Green Deal 
(EGD) designed in order to counteract climate change, to protect biodiversity and ecosystems, and to 
ensure a fair economic return for farmers.

DL approaches usually outperform other (shallow) machine learning techniques in terms of overall accuracy 
(OA)24–26. However, the understanding of these techniques is  limited27, and typically, the better the learning of an 
algorithm the more difficult its interpretation  is28. This lack of interpretability is a major point to consider when 
using these algorithms. For many users it is not only important to use an algorithm that provides high accuracy 
but also to know how the algorithm is reaching the provided  predictions29. The interpretability of predictions 
becomes a critical aspect when they are used as rationale for decision making, such as in medicine, business or 
in the banking/payment  sector30–32.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some aspects related to this topic.

Firstly, the text mentions that the dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for validation. This division suggests that the model performance might have been monitored using cross-validation techniques, where the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch or iteration during training.

Secondly, the context discusses the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In RNNs, including LSTMs, monitoring strategies often involve tracking metrics like loss and accuracy over time. Additionally, visualization tools may be employed to observe trends in these metrics throughout the training process.

Lastly, the context emphasizes the importance of interpretability in deep learning models. While this doesn't directly address the monitoring strategy, it implies that any chosen method should ideally provide insights into the model's behavior and decision-making processes.

In conclusion, while the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training isn't specified, based on common practices in machine learning and the context provided, it could involve cross-validation techniques, tracking of key metrics, and possibly visualization tools.
