2.2. Downloading the records 

The  following  variables  were  imported  for  each  record:1)  type  of 
content (dataset, data study, software, or repository), 2) data source (the 
source  from  which  the  data  were  obtained),  and  3)  Web  of  Science 
category of the data source (i.e. multidisciplinary agriculture, ecology, 
biodiversity conservation, and environmental sciences). 

The bibliographic information collected using the DCI for each re-
cord  includes  authors/creators,  year  of  publication  (the  collected  re-
cords  were  published  from  1900  to  the  present),  title  of  the  dataset, 
publisher (understood as the repository in which the data are deposited 
or the organisation responsible for making the data available), version, 
and permanent identifier (e.g. a unique URL, databank accession num-
ber, or another permanent identifier such as Handle (hdl) (http://www. 
handle.net/)).

Of  the  11,162  distinct  authors  identified,  11  had  more  than  100 
published  datasets,  with  the  most  productive  author  being  Ignazio 
Carbone  (n  = 177),  a  professor  at  North  Carolina  State  University 
working  in  the  areas  of  evolutionary  biology,  molecular  population 
genetics, and genomics. In terms of the number of citations received, 
3277 records received at least one citation, accounting for 52.1% of the 
total citations. Of these, 15 received five or more citations. The most 
frequently cited dataset, i.e., “Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobo-
tanical Databases”, received 17 citations; this dataset was deposited in 
the “Ag Data Commons” repository in 2016, was of the type “dataset” 
and fell within the WoS category “agriculture, multidisciplinary”. This 
dataset can be accessed at the following DOI: https://data.nal.usda.gov/ 
dataset/dr-dukes-phytochemical-and-ethnobotanical-databases.

Another aspect is the type of content, according to the differentiation 
made  by  the  DCI  between  the  dataset,  data  study,  and  software.  In 
general, most records are classified as either data studies  or datasets, 
with  software  being  much  more  residual.  Although  the  top  eight  re-
positories  contained  few  records  that  were  not  datasets,  the  case  of 
Figshare was different. In this repository, which was also the most used, 
90.52% of the records were of the data study type. Subsequently, when 
analysing the DOI of each repository through F-UJI, we found that the 
vast majority of the data study records belonged to papers published in 
this journal  (PLOS One, 2019). In the  subsequent F-UJI  analysis, Fig-
share obtained very low scores when PLOS ONE DOI was isolated from 
the remainder. This phenomenon illustrates the need to understand the 
differences between the different typologies of materials that can exist in

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would require additional details about the project, its developers, or any related publications to locate the correct repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Please provide more context so I can assist you better.
