Table 2 presents a summary of instances before and after the filtering 
process, along with the percentage of valid data for each variable. The 
pre-filtered instances represent the total number of data points before 
any  filtering  procedures  were  applied.  After  filtering,  post-filtered in-
stances  depict  the  remaining  data  points  that  passed  the  filtering 
criteria. The ‘Significant data (%)’  column indicates the proportion of 
instances  deemed  valid  after  filtering,  providing  insights  into  the 
effectiveness of the data cleaning process. As discussed in more detail in 
subsection 2.3, data filtering consists of manually removing outliers and 
smoothing them with a moving average.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given table (Table 1), it can be inferred that the dataset features include variables such as Soil Moisture, Pressure, Precipitation, Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Global Radiation, Reflected Radiation, Atmospheric Radiation, Emitted Radiation, Sensible Heat Flux, Latent Heat Flux, and Carbon Dioxide Flux. These variables suggest that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline might be numerical or tabular data, possibly in a structured format like CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains an educated guess.
