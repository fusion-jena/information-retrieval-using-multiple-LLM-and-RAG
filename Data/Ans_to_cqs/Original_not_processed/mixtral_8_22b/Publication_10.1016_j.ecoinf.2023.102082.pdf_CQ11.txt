LiDAR GEDI derived tree canopy height heterogeneity reveals patterns of 
biodiversity in forest ecosystems

2022),  biomass  density  (Duncanson  et  al.,  2022),  forest  fuels  classifi-
cation (Hoffr´en et al., 2023) and surface elevation (Quir´os et al., 2021) 
which are key components for a global monitoring of forest ecosystems. 
Limitations at local scale arise because of the generalized footprint and 
the  sparse  sampling  design  (Liu  et  al.,  2022).  To  extrapolate  GEDI 
samples  for  continuous  information  on  vegetation  structure,  multiple 
approaches  have  been  developed  fusing  GEDI  samples  with  passive 
optical images in machine learning models (Liu et al., 2022; Rishmawi 
et al., 2021; Kacic et al., 2021). At global scale, Potapov et al. (2021) 
made use of machine learning algorithms to compute and derive a global 
forest  canopy  height  map  (hereafter  “Potapov30m”)  at  30  m  spatial 
resolution fusing GEDI and phenology metrics based on Landsat 8 OLI 
imagery. More recently Lang et al. (2022), Lang et al. (2022), produced a

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific data repository containing the deep learning pipeline used by M. Torresani et al. However, it mentions two datasets used in their research - Lang10m and Potapov30m. The links to download these datasets are provided as follows:

1. Lang10m: <https://langnico.github.io/globalcanopyheight/>
2. Potapov30m: <https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/gedi/>

These links may lead to further resources related to the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a more precise answer regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline itself.
