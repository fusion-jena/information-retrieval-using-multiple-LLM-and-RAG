passes over the entire training set) and a batch size of 64, with an ADAM 
(cid:0) 5. Image augmentation was applied 
optimiser and a learning rate of 10
in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter clock wise shear and a 
random zoom between 0 and 0.2 - all leading to 224 Ã— 244 pixel RGB 
input tensors. Data was normalised to ImageNet mean values, and the 
pixels values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. Model training took 
roughly 4 days. The best model was selected based on minimal valida-
tion loss that occurred at epoch 448. This model showed a training loss 
of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298 and 
validation accuracy of 0.891. We evaluated the red kite model perfor-
mance based on an independent test set of 2060 images (as described in 
3.3). 950 of these images were true positive red kites images and the

only  the  newly  added  layers  were  trained.  ResNet50s  are  commonly 
used in practice, especially for transfer-learning applications, since they 
offer a good trade-off between inference time and accuracy. Similarly, 
de Lutio et al., 2021; Miao et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2017 successfully 
applied ResNet50s to train a plant, and two wildlife detection models 
respectively.

Since our workflow is designed to be generic, take advantage of the 
text and image data and combine records from citizen science reports 
with social media data, it uses a combination of a simple rule based- 
approach, existing pre-trained models and a model trained specifically 
for our target species (Fig. 2). Our approach is designed to take advan-
tage  of  what  we  assume  to  be  high  quality  data  collected  by  citizen 
scientists with an interest in ornithology, use off-the-shelf models where 
possible, and reduce the initial number of social media posts in a given 
region to a manageable size for manual verification. Our workflow thus:

particular species is of interest, typical approaches analyse data using 
either simple keyword extraction (e.g. by compiling lists of potentially 
relevant terms) applied to metadata, followed by some form of disam-
biguation  or  classification  to  remove  records  using  matched  terms  in 
another sense. Progress in off-the-shelf image classification approaches

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. These include image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, counterclockwise shearing, random zooming, and normalizing the input tensors to ImageNet mean values. Additionally, pixels values were rescaled within the range of [0, 1] to ensure consistent input scales across different images. These preprocessing steps help improve the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning model.
