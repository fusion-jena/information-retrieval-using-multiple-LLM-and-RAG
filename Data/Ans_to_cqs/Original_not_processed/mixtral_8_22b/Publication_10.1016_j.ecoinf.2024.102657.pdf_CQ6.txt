grams, and created the metadata .csv file necessary for training the CNN 
and k-NN. Identical in structure to the metadata file outlined above, this 
file contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the met-
adata for the entire dataset. 

No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the 
goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to 
demonstrate  the  power  of  human-machine  teaming.  Further,  when 
assessing the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data, 
the accuracy levels were similar: after 10 trials, the CNN’s accuracy on 
the  filtered  data  averaged  to  99.22%  and  the  accuracy  on  the  non- 
filtered data averaged to 99.25%.

3.3. Test 3: Training on 80% of data and adding in 2 new dialect classes

2.2. Training 

Next, DialectDecoder trained the two classification networks based 
on the labeled training data. Each dialect class was split into a training 
set, a validation set, and a testing set by taking the first 70% of songs in 
the folder as the training set, the next 10% as the validation set, and the 
last 20% as the test set to reduce variability between tests. We note that 
while the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the 
CNN, the only hyperparameter of the k-NN is the value of k, which we 
fixed as k = 4, as this value yielded the best performance after testing 
several values. Hence both the training and validation sets, totaling 80% 
of the full dataset, were used directly to fit the k-NN. Thus, we used 80% 
of the full data set to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier 
and to train the k-NN location classifier, and reserved 20% of the data set 
to test the two systems’ ability to classify songs correctly.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models (i.e., CNN and k-NN). However, it mentions that no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms beyond creating the metadata.csv files required for training. This suggests that the primary preprocessing step involved converting bird songs into spectrogram images and generating corresponding metadata. The goal was to minimize preprocessing to demonstrate the effectiveness of human-machine teaming. Therefore, it can be inferred that common preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning might not have been employed in this particular case.
