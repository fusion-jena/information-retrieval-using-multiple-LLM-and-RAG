executed as an important post-classification step in which a reference 
dataset is used to compare the classified image to determine the level of 
accuracy. Stratified random sampling is adopted in ERDAS IMAGINE, 
and  then  500  sample  points  were  created  in  the  study  area.  Kappa 
analysis,  a  discrete  multivariate  technique,  is  used  to  calculate  pro-
ducer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy, and overall kappa 
statistics to find the accuracy and reliability of the LULC maps produced 
(Table 2).

%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The table titled "MLP parameters and performance" provides information on the performance of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) deep learning model. Two main metrics are used to evaluate its performance: Training Root Mean Square (RMS) error and Testing RMS error. These errors represent the difference between predicted values and actual values during training and testing phases respectively. Additionally, the Accuracy Rate and Skill Measure (%) provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify data. In this case, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 88.79% and a skill measure of 0.8719. However, it should be noted that other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
