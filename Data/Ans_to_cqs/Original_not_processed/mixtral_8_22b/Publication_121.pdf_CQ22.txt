Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Model Validation: The performance of the models is greatly
inﬂuenced by the number of times it goes under training.
Using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, the models were
validated with a test dataset. The performances of the models
were evaluated by calculating accuracies and losses of training
samples in each epoch. The model based on MobileNetV2
showed (Fig. 2) the training accuracy up to 97% and validation
accuracy up to 84%. The model based on MobileNetV3-Large
exhibit a training accuracy of 94% and validation accuracy up
to 87%.
Fine-Tuning Results: After ﬁne-tuning, the training accuracy
of the MobileNetV2-based model was improved to 97%,
and validation accuracy remained at 86% at each epoch.
The training accuracy of the MobileNetV3-based model was
improved to up to 96% (Fig. 3), and validation accuracy up
to 89% after 10 epochs. Note the gap between training and
validation curves for the MobileNetV3-based model is less
than the MobileNetV2-based model.

D. Model Training

Feature Extraction: The hardware to train the model included
a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz
of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-
bit system. The software tools included Annaconda3 Jupyter
Notebook with Python 3.8, where the Tensorﬂow, OpenCV-
python3 [37] and Keras [38] libraries were used. The dataset
was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789
images and a test set of 1930 images. To obtain the pre-
trained weight parameters, we built the base models from the
MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using two main metrics: accuracy and loss. These metrics are calculated for both training samples and validation datasets during each epoch. In this case, the authors used sparse categorical cross-entropy loss to validate their models.

For instance, the MobileNetV2-based model achieved a training accuracy of up to 97% and a validation accuracy of up to 84%. Similarly, the MobileNetV3-Large-based model exhibited a training accuracy of 94% and a validation accuracy of up to 87%.

After fine-tuning, the training accuracy of the MobileNetV2-based model improved to 97%, while its validation accuracy remained at 86% at each epoch. On the other hand, the training accuracy of the MobileNetV3-based model improved to up to 96%, and its validation accuracy reached up to 89% after ten epochs.

Therefore, the primary metrics used to assess the performance of these deep learning models are accuracy and loss. However, there is no mention of other evaluation metrics such as precision or recall in the given context.
