scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the dataset for deep learning model training, such as train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning involve splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set.

Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is utilized during the model development process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used after the final model has been selected to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Common ratios for splitting the dataset include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, but this can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being addressed. In some cases, techniques like k-fold cross-validation may be applied instead of fixed splits.
