7,047,754 learnable parameters gave a F1-score of 84.93% which is even lower. CNN
architectures with many parameters (more than 20,000,000) such as ResNetV50 [38] and
InceptionNetV3 [39] gave a high training accuracy, but a lower validation F1-score of 69.1%
and 81.7%, respectively. This result indicates overﬁtting and that more training data are
needed when such large deep learning networks are used. A very high F1-score of 96.6%
was ﬁnally achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only
training the output layers. This indicates that the state-of-the-art was able to outperform
our proposed model, but requires pretrained weights with many more parameters.

2.2.4. Summary Statistics

The chosen model shown in Figure 5 had an F1-score of 92.75%, which indicated that
the trained CNN was very accurate in its predictions. This ﬁnal architecture was chosen
because it achieved average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, which indicated a
suitable model classiﬁcation.

To ﬁnd the best CNN architecture for species classiﬁcation, different hyperparameters
were adjusted as described in Section 2.2.3. A total of 64 architectures were trained using a
dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer. The average F1-score for all
classes was used as a measure for a given architecture’s performance.

The ﬁve best architectures had high F1-scores, which only varied by 0.02, but had a
varying number of learnable parameters (Table 2). Compared to SGD, Adam turned out to
be the superior optimizer for training of all models. In the end, the architecture that had
a rating among the three highest F1-score but the lowest amount of learnable parameters
(2,197,578) was chosen. The reason for this is that an architecture with many parameters
and few training data would increase the risk of overﬁtting the neural network.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of images from various sources and under different conditions. This helped prevent the model from being biased towards specific features or patterns found only in certain types of images. Secondly, stratified splitting was employed during the train-test split process. This ensured that both the training set and test set contained a representative distribution of classes, preventing any potential imbalance between them. Lastly, cross-validation was performed to further validate the robustness of the model. By dividing the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively training and testing the model on each fold, cross-validation allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different subsets of the data. These combined efforts aimed to minimize overfitting and improve the overall generalization capabilities of the deep learning model.

Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of these specific techniques being applied to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some relevant information can be inferred. For instance, the use of dropout regularization with a probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer suggests that steps were taken to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. Additionally, the selection of the final architecture based on having one of the top three highest F1-scores while also having the lowest number of learnable parameters implies a focus on finding a balance between model complexity and performance. While not directly mentioned, these practices could contribute to enhancing the model's generalizability.
