Through a series of new learning architectures and algorithms, have been transformed;
DELE methods are now the state-of-the-art in object, speech and audio recognition.
Deng and Yu (2013) had proposed methods and applications of DELE. A large deep
convolutional neural network trained (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012) to classify
1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into 1000
diﬀerent classes.
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
become very popular and have achieved great success in many computer vision
tasks particularly in object recognition. Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks
(CSRNs) applied (Alom, Alam, Taha, & Iftekharuddin, 2017) to generate initial ﬁlters
of CNNs for features extraction and Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM)
for classiﬁcation. Experiments were conducted on three popular data sets for object
recognition (such as face, pedestrian, and car) to evaluate the performance of the pro-

This is a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams
and uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a basic building block in which the
outputs of each level are used as inputs to the next one (Sun, Zhang, Zhang, & Hu, 2017).
An autoencoder is an ANN used for unsupervised learning of eﬃcient coding. The aim
of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, but with the
output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the
purpose of reconstructing its own inputs (instead of predicting target value Y given
inputs X). The algorithm is described below (Sun et al., 2017):

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several types of data used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton (2012) trained a large deep convolutional neural network to classify 1.2 million high-resolution images from the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into 1000 different classes. This indicates that image data was used in this particular deep learning application. Furthermore, the paper by Giannakopoulos (2015) discusses the use of audio signals in deep learning models, specifically for audio signal analysis using Python libraries. Additionally, the authors mention the use of cellular simultaneous recurrent networks (CSRNs) for generating initial filters of CNNs for feature extraction and regularized extreme learning machines (RELMs) for classification. These techniques could potentially be applied to various types of data, including images, audio, or other forms of structured data such as CSV files. However, it should be noted that the specific type of data used would depend on the problem being addressed and the chosen deep learning architecture.
