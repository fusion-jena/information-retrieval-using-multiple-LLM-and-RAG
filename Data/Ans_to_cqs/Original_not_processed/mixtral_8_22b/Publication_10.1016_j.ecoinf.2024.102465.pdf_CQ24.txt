Networks,  Long  Short-Term  Memory  networks  (LSTM),  and  Convolu-

employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework 
for  determining  the  sentiment  index.  The  LSTM-CNN  model  out-
performed the other models in sentiment task analysis (Sosa, 2017). This 
model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local 
feature  extraction  capability  of  CNN  to  process  text  data,  harnessing 
their unique strengths for enhanced model performance.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning and deep learning that techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms could be used to manage randomness. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of the same model. Additionally, cross-validation techniques, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning can also contribute to handling randomness and improving overall model performance.
