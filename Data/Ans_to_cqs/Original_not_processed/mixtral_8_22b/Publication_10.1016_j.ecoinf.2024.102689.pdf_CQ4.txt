balanced  artificial  illumination  system.  Additionally,  the  defogging 
procedure relies on artificial background light and depth estimation of 
the transmission map. This approach significantly enhances the visual 
quality of images for human observers. Moghimi and Mohanna (2021) 
presented  a  real-time  underwater  image  resolution  enhancement 
method  using  deep  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs).  They 
initially improved the quality of underwater images, addressing issues 
such as darkening, fogging, and haze. Then, they employed a CNN with 
deep learning capabilities to further enhance the resolution of the pre- 
optimized images. This real-time algorithm demonstrates efficacy and 
robustness across diverse underwater conditions. Chambah et al. (2003)

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of models by introducing variations into the dataset. It is likely that some or all of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the context, but without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed which ones were specifically utilized.
