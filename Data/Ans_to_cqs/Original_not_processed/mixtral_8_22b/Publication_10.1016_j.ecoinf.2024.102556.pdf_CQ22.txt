to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

this issue, the state Xk vector of the optimized KF is defined in Eq. (8) and 
the  measurement  vector  Zk  is  given  by  Eq.  (9),  where  k  denotes  a 
moment in a given period. Deep SORT, which takes Q and R as functions 
of  estimated  elements  and  metrics,  generates  a  time-dependent  sum. 
Alternations in the state vector of the improved KF require a constant 
correction  of  the  process  noise  covariance  Qk  and  the  measurement 
noise covariance Rk, as given in Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively:

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (DollÂ´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding what metrics are being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, typically, depending upon the problem statement and requirements, different evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, confusion matrix, etc., could be employed to measure the effectiveness of a deep learning model.
