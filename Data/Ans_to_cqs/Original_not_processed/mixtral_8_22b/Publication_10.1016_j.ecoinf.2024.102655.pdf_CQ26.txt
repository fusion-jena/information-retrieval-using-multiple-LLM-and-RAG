2.2. Data pre-processing

The complete dataset of 42 WQPs (Appendix A) for the 13 moni-
toring sites was subjected to an outlier detection and artificial data
replacement process, as Casillas-García et al. (2021) reported. Processed
data were used subsequently to train machine learning models, first with

the full dataset of 13 monitoring sites and secondly with the best training
subset (BTS) composed of sites selected by CA and TSA. Predictions from
all models were evaluated by comparing the root-mean-square-error
(RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and
coefficient of determination (R2) and finally, the BTS-ANFIS was tested
against new data and individual data from each monitoring site. The
general procedure for the training data selection and model develop-
ment is described in Fig. 2.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses outlier detection and artificial data replacement processes for data pre-processing. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during this stage. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be determined which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
