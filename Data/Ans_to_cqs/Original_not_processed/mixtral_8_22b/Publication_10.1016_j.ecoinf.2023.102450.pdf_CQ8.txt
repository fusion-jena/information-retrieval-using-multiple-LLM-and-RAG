The Siamese relation network(Cheng et al., 2021) used a deep re-
sidual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale 
features from images of animals. The cascade structure of a region-based 
convolutional neural network was used to classify the proposed location 
boxes. The Siamese relation network introduced two primary modules 
into  the network structure, namely, a relation detector module and a 
refinement  module.  The  relation  detector  module  was  equipped  with 
three different nonlinear detectors, including the global, local, and patch 
detectors. These detectors were used to compare the relationships be-
tween the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression 
features,  including  pixel-wise,  patch-wise,  and  global  features.  The 
refinement module converted the output of the relation detector into a 
matching  score  followed  by  an  element-wise  replication  between  the

matching score and cross-correlation feature map of the classification 
branch. Finally, a refined classification confidence score was generated 
using a convolution operation. The refinement module effectively inte-
grated  the  relation  detector  into  the  Siamese  framework  to  suppress 
false-positive detections and filter background interference.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the provided sources mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which platform hosts the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). It would require additional information or resources to provide an accurate response.
