mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the purpose or type of any deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to machine learning and geospatial modeling. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques when data is abundant, where datasets can be divided into three parts - training, validation, and test sets. These sets help in fitting models, estimating prediction errors, and assessing the accuracy of the final model respectively.

In terms of deep learning models, they could serve different purposes depending on their application. For instance, a deep learning model might be designed for image classification tasks, where it would categorize images into predefined classes based on learned features. Alternatively, it could be employed for object detection, identifying and localizing objects within an image. Another potential application is semantic segmentation, which involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class, effectively creating a detailed understanding of the scene.

However, without more specific details regarding the deep learning model mentioned in the original text, we cannot definitively state its purpose.
