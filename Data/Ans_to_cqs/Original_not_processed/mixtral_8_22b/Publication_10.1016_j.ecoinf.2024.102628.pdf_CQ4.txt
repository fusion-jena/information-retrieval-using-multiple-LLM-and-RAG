To expand our dataset, we tripled the image pool for each transect by 
incorporating multi-temporal data. By drawing data from a three-month 
span (March, September and October 2015) across three environments, 
we could more effectively train and test deep learning models, which 
inherently  demand  many  images  to  learn  effectively,  however,

both training and testing. A critical point to highlight is that models are 
retrained  for  each  fold,  preventing  previous  fold’s  information  from 
being transferred. We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 (Which consists 
of  a  34-layer  convolutional  neural  network)  architecture  which  is  a 
variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep 
learning tasks, particularly in computer vision (He et al., 2016). ResNet- 
34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to 
leverage  existing  knowledge,  this  is  particularly  useful  in  our  dataset 
since its small size. Transfer learning generally consists in using a model 
pre-trained  on  broad  datasets,  like  ImageNet  (Deng  et  al.,  2009),  to 
specialized tasks with more limited data. As part of the cross-validation 
of the Leave-One-Group-Out approach, the test directory containing the 
multitemporal transect was temporarily moved to test, and DataLoaders

Our approach is influenced by earlier research, including works by 
Almeida et al. (2019), Atkins et al. (2020), and Scheeres et al. (2023). 
These studies laid the groundwork by employing a "multidimensional" 
framework  to  analyze  forest  structure  and  classify  forest  types  using 
LiDAR  data.  However,  their  main  emphasis  was  on  utilizing  simple 
metrics,  particularly  in  areas that  are  disturbed  or  undergoing  regen-
eration. Here, we extend their foundational work by integrating deep 
learning techniques, which enabled a more in-depth exploration of the 
available  data  within  an  undisturbed  old-growth  forest.  Our  deep 
learning framework, even when trained with a limited dataset of just six 
transects  per  topographical  type,  effectively  discerns  fine-scale  forest 
structures using 2D point cloud image data. This approach marks also a 
departure from previous studies like Almeida et al. (2019), Atkins et al.

2.5.1. Classification problem (Q1): Deep learning applied to 2D LiDAR 
images for Forest classification 

We  employed  the  fast.ai  platform  (Howard  and  Gugger,  2020)  to 
train and validate models for the classification of 2D point cloud images, 
utilizing  a  LOGO  (Leave-One-Group-Out)  cross-validation.  In  this 
approach, our target classes were "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-
ian",  designated  as  "p",  "w",  and  "r"  respectively.  In  each  iteration,  a 
complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training 
process  (the  grouping  factor  giving  the  lack  of  independence  in  the 
multi-temporal data) and subsequently tested. This approach ensured an 
assessment  of  the  model’s  performance,  accounting  for  our  data  con-
straints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., that have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on expanding the dataset by incorporating multi-temporal data from different months and environments. Additionally, it mentions the use of transfer learning, specifically the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, but there is no mention of any particular data augmentation technique being implemented. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
