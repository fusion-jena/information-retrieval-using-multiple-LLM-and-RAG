The  PLUS  model  consists  of  two  main  modules:  the  transformed 
specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis 
strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on 
a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). In the LEAS mod-
ule, the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the 
development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of 
land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, 
which  uses  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  to  determine  develop-
ment  probabilities  based  on  only  one  period  of  land  use  data.  Addi-
tionally,  the  PLUS  model  proposes  a  decreasing  threshold  rule  for 
generating  patch  seeds.  This  gradual  constraint  on  patch  growth  of 
various land use types is achieved through the iterative process. Cells 
with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this research. However, it can be inferred from the methodology section that the authors have employed various techniques such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting to improve the robustness and reliability of their models. For instance, they have utilized multiple sources of data including NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. Additionally, they have performed downscaling of meteorological data to match the spatial resolution of other input variables. These approaches suggest that the authors have made efforts to enhance the generalizability of their models by incorporating diverse datasets and ensuring consistency across different scales. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific methods used for validation or evaluation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
