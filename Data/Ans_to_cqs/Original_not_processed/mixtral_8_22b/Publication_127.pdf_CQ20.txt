A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models mentioned. Typically, deep learning models require significant computational resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), but without explicit mention in the provided text, it cannot be definitively stated what hardware resources were utilized.
