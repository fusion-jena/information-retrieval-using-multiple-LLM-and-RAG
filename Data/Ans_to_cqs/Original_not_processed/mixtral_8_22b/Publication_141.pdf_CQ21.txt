Fig. 3. Morphological characters of the training set used by the classiﬁer in CNN models at species, genus, and subfamily level of taxonomic identiﬁcation. Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps with the relevant characters for each of the three models (red = most important region for classiﬁcation). The
percentages indicate proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classiﬁcation in the training set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this

the genus (5) and subfamily level (2) all images were correctly
assigned. It is also notable that each model performed very well
even after the ﬁrst phase of the training, where the ResNet-50
encoder was frozen and only the fully connected layer was trained.

cies level (Table 2). The network performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar object
(e.g., does not contain non-biting midges). As expected, the results
further improved when ﬁne-tuning was applied in the second
training phase, where the whole network was trained allowing
the model to learn additional features speciﬁc to our dataset.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and visualize its decision-making process. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score; generating saliency maps or gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM) to highlight the regions of input images that contributed most to the classification decisions made by the model; and creating confusion matrices to compare predicted labels against actual labels and identify areas of misclassification. In the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated accuracy metrics and created Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize the relevant morphological traits used by their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for successful classification. However, they do not explicitly mention using other postprocessing techniques such as confusion matrices or saliency maps.
