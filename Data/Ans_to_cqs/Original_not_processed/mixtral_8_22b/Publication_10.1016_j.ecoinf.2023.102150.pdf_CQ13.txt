rate of 0.000001 and a maximum learning rate of 0.001 (Smith, 2018). 
We explored different hyper-parameters and choose the ones that gave 

the best results for training the final model. All images were resized to 
224 x 224 pixels previous to training and image augmentation (shifts, 
horizontal flips, rotations, zooms and shears) was applied to expand the

We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model used in this research employed the ResNet50 architecture with an Adam optimizer. The model was trained from scratch for 55 epochs with a one-cycle learning rate policy. This policy had a minimum learning rate of 0.000001 and a maximum learning rate of 0.001. Different hyperparameters were explored, and those that yielded the best results for training the final model were chosen. However, the specific values or ranges of these other hyperparameters are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
