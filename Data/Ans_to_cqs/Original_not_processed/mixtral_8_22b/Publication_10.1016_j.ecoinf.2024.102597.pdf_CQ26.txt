Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

RF is the first algorithm selected as a representative of the bagging 
algorithm family, Random Forest (RF) is the first algorithm we selected 
(Breiman,  2001).  Taking regression  as  an example,  its  core idea  is  to 
construct multiple weak learners in parallel and ultimately output the 
result as the average of the weak learners to enhance model accuracy. In 
addition,  we  chose  several  Boosting  algorithms.  The  GBDT,  improves 
upon the initial boosting algorithm by introducing the concepts of fitting 
residuals and sampling (Friendman, 2001). XGBoost, built upon GBDT, 
it  incorporated  a  structural  risk  term  into  the  loss  function  L(y,y ˆ), 
forming the objective functionO(y,y ˆ), XGBoost also introduced a novel 
impurity measure metric, which considers complexity in splitting rules 
(Chen and Guestrin, 2016). Additionally, it employs new tree-building 
processes, such as estimation greedy algorithms, parallel learning, and

suggesting that it is better suited for handling outliers. If the research 
samples  contain  a  significant  proportion  of  extremely  high  and  low 
values, it may  be more appropriate  to use LGBM instead of XGBoost. 
Surprisingly, the relatively new CatBoost algorithm did not perform as 
well when handling extreme values; it showed a 6% decrease in RMSE 
when estimating turbidity. Finally, the Stacking Model proposed in this

quantile sketching algorithms. LGBM achieves a reduction in the num-
ber of sample features through gradient-based one-sided sampling and 
exclusive  feature  bundling  techniques  and  significantly  improves  the 
processing  speed  of  the  algorithm  (Meng,  2018).  CatBoost,  which  is 
based  on  symmetric  decision  trees,  can  handle  one-hot  encoding  for 
discrete features, addressing gradient bias and prediction shifts, leading 
to  improved  algorithm  accuracy  and  generalisation  capabilities  (Pro-
khorenkova  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  study,  an  integrated  development 
environment based on Python and Anaconda was used to complete the 
construction, training, testing, and hyperparameter optimisation of all 
models. RF and GBDT were provided in the Scikit-learn library, whereas 
XGBoost,  LGBM,  and  CatBoost  were  implemented  through  the 
Scikit-learn API interfaces.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, ensuring each subset has roughly the same distribution of classes or labels. This technique helps maintain class balance across different stages of the machine learning process.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic examples from the minority class are created to achieve balanced datasets. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) generate artificial instances between existing minority class instances.

Undersampling reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing instances until the desired ratio with the minority class is achieved. It should be noted that undersampling might lead to losing valuable information.

Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources and demographics to ensure fair representation and reduce biases. This approach can help improve the overall performance and reliability of the deep learning models.
