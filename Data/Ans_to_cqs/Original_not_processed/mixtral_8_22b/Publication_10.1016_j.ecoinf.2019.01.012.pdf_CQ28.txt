The trained classiﬁer was then applied on whole repeat photographs, which were also split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. The classiﬁer predicts the output for each single
tile and reassembles them to the original image size.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. None of the sources mentioned provide details about the deployment environment or any cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
