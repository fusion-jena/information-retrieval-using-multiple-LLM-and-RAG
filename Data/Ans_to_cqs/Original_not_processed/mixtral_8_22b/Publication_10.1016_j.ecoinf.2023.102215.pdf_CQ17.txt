networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers 
because of the small receptive fields (Liu et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2021). 
For  creating  feature  maps  with  much  global  information,  multiple 
dilated convolutions are used for shallow layers (Zhao et al., 2020)— 
which, however, entail more computation resources. U2-Net defines a 
two-level  nested  model  (i.e.,  a  stack  of  nested  encoder-decoder)  to 
capture the contextual information in different scales at a moderate level 
of computation cost.

of dilated convolution with various dilated rates to enlarge the receptive 
field, which not only extracts richer global information but also saves 
significant time and memory resources.

2.3. Model training 

Our study can be categorized as a binary classification. We supervise 
TrunkNet’s training with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, 
which  is  a  commonly  employed  loss  function  in  supervised  deep 
learning (Zhao et al., 2019b). The BCE loss function measures the dif-
ference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Mini-
mizing this difference indicates a better training effect. Specifically, the 
BCE loss function in use is expressed with 

L BCE = (cid:0)

∑W

x=1

G(x, y)logSpre(x, y) + (1 (cid:0) G(x, y))log(1 (cid:0) Spre(x, y)),

where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of 
the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre  is the final pre-
dicted saliency map.

We use different global-feature extractors at different levels for the 
following two reasons. First, a deeper global feature extractor at shallow 
levels  facilitates  reserving  continuous  information.  To  extract  global 
context,  a  straightforward  approach  is  to  enlarge  the  receptive  field, 
which  is  often  achieved  through  dilated  convolution.  If  the  dilated 
convolution is directly conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, 
however,  the  continuous  information  contained  in  them  will  be  lost. 
Thus,  we  apply  more  convolution  and  pooling  operations  at  shallow 
levels before conducting dilated convolution to extract as much original 
continuity information as possible. Second, a series of dilated convolu-
tions at deeper levels facilitates extracting richer global context infor-
mation. At deeper levels, the input feature map’s resolutions are small in 
comparison to those of the shallow layers. Thus, we directly use a group

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss function for supervising TrunkNet's training. While not explicitly stated, using a loss function like BCE could potentially help mitigate overfitting by providing a measure of how well the network is generalizing to unseen data during training. Additionally, the use of dilated convolutions might also contribute to reducing overfitting by allowing the network to capture larger context without increasing the number of parameters or computational complexity. Nevertheless, without specific mention of techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization, it cannot be definitively confirmed if these were utilized in the described methodology.
