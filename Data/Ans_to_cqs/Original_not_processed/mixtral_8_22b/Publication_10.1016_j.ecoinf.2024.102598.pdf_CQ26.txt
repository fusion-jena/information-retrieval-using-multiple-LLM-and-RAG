Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

To  address  spatial  sampling  biases  and  spatial  autocorrelation  chal-
lenges in the analysis, we employed a bootstrapping approach using the 
spThin package in R (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2019). To achieve a 1 km 
spatial resolution for the modeling exercise, we conducted 50 iterations 
of  bootstrapping  using  a  minimum  thinning  distance  of  1  km.  This 
process  resulted  in  obtaining  12,577  unique  locations.  This  approach 
effectively minimized  the removal of records while significantly miti-
gating sampling bias (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2015; Radosavljevic and 
Anderson,  2014).  Spatially-constrained  and  combined  methods  for 
generating  background  points  show  greater  efficacy  in  modeling  out-
comes  despite  ongoing  debates  regarding  the  optimal  method  for 
generating them (Shipley et al., 2022). For this modeling exercise, we 
used Arc Map 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA), employing a combined method

over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of ensemble modeling to enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, provide robustness against overfitting, and increase model interpretability. It also discusses the employment of a bootstrapping approach using the spThin package in R to minimize the removal of records and significantly mitigate sampling bias. Additionally, spatially-constrained and combined methods were utilized for generating background points, which showed greater efficacy in modeling outcomes. These approaches could potentially contribute to reducing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
