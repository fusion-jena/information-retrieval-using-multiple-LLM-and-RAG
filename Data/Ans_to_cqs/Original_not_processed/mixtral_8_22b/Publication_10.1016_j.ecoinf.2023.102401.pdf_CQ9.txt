Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

dataset  contains  638  images,  divided  into  seven  categories,  with  510 
images for training and  128 for testing. The trash-ICRA19 dataset in-
cludes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training 
and 229 for testing. The VisDrone dataset is selected as part of the Tiny 
Target Dataset and comprises 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. 
The training set consists of 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 
images. NWPU VHR-10 and HRSID are small target datasets for remote 
sensing. The NWPU VHR-10 dataset includes 800 images with ten cat-
egories, and the training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, 
respectively. The HRSID dataset contains 5604 images in one category, 
and the training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respec-
tively. By testing YWnet on these diverse datasets, we aimed to assess its 
performance in various scenarios, including marine environments and 
detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

compared  to  the  original  YOLOv5.  Krishnan  et  al.  (2022)  focused  on 
data  augmentation  techniques  to  increase  the  size  of  training  under-
water datasets, leading to improved detection performance and average 
precision.

3.1. The backbone of YWnet 

The  feature  extraction  phase  is  considered  crucial  in  the  training 
process,  as  it  plays  a  significant  role  in  enhancing  detection  perfor-
mance. The objective of this work is to improve detection accuracy by 
designing  a  feature  extraction  mechanism  that  incorporates  rich  se-
mantic  information  and  integrates  features  from  multiple  scales.  By 
leveraging these strategies, the aim is to capture and utilize a compre-
hensive range of relevant features, thereby enhancing the overall per-
formance of the detection system. As a result, a CBAM is added to the 
network's  backbone  to  improve  feature  extraction  from  the  incoming 
semantic information. Simultaneously, a novel feature extraction mod-
ule called SRC3 is provided to extract rich semantic information from 
the complicated undersea environment.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would require additional information beyond what has been provided to accurately determine the data repository's location.
