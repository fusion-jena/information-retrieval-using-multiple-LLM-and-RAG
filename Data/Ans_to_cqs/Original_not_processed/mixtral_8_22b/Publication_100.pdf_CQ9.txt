As commonly done in deep learning, we iteratively learn the model
parameters with stochastic gradient descend, starting from a random
initialization. In each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of ùêµ = 64
reference data patches of size 15 √ó 15 pixels, where a patch is only
considered for training if the center pixel is forested. We consider a
pixel forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with
ùê∑ùëß > 1.3 m, see Section 3.1) and also is considered forested based on
NIBIO‚Äôs Norway-wide timber volume map (Astrup et al., 2019). We use
the latter as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary
noise from non-forested areas, as we are interested in learning forest
characteristics only. For every reference data patch, we randomly pick
an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one as-
cending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one
of the optical image. Using SAR with both ascending and descending

4.5. Implementation details

We have implemented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017).
We trained ùëÄ = 5 models with batch size ùêµ = 64 and a base learning
rate ùõº = 10‚àí4. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor
of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive
epochs. We apply weight decay to control the strength of the unit
Gaussian prior, with an empirically chosen magnitude of 10‚àí3 that
is inversely proportional to the hyperparameter ùúÜ from Eq. (1). We
chose ùõΩ1 = 0.9, ùõΩ2 = 0.999 and ùúñ = 10‚àí8 as hyper-parameters for the
Adam optimizer. Each neural network was trained on a single Nvidia
RTX2080Ti GPU for ‚àº14 days.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any explicit information about the availability or location of the data repository used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without further context, it is impossible to determine where the data repository is available.
