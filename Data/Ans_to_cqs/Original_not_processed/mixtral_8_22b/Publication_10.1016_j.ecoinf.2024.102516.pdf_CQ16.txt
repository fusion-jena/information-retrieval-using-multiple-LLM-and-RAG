information usable as annotations for network training.

therefore also easily usable as training data. Therefore, this amount of 
well-annotated  data  is  an  optimal  supplement  to  the  already  existing 
plant cover annotation data. 

While we have the option to pre-train our network for classification 
and apply it on plant cover data afterward, we have shown in K¨orschens 
et al. (2021b) that training a network for classification only often leads 
to the network focussing on a small number of discriminative parts of the 
plants instead of all visible parts. This can be especially detrimental in 
plant  cover  prediction,  where  often  only  the  leaves  of  the  plants  are 
visible, while the network focuses on the blossoms of the plants during 
pre-training, as they are usually the most discriminative parts.

In this phase the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute 
error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution 
(cid:0) 5. Moreover, we utilize 
of 1536 × 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10
only horizontal flipping for data augmentation in this phase. 

2.5. Baseline comparison 

To also have a comparison of our method with a simpler approach, 
we compare our results with the ones from a ResNet50 that was pre- 
trained  on  the  ImageNet  classification  dataset  (Russakovsky  et  al., 
2015) with added FPN, later also referred to at ImageNet baseline model. 
As the ImageNet dataset is a normal classification dataset that does not 
contain the plant species from our dataset, this network cannot be uti-
lized  for  zero-shot  cover  prediction.  Hence,  we  only  evaluate  this 
network after training it on our dedicated plant cover data.

extract  plant  cover  information  without  training  on  actual  annotated 
plant cover data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, or meeting other user-defined stopping conditions. In this case, since the text mentions training a network with a mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, it might indicate that the training process continues until the validation loss reaches a satisfactory level or stops improving further. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it would be speculative to definitively state the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular scenario.
