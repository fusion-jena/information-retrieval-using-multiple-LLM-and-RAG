downscalings extrapolated by comparing the training data at the cali-
bration points with the projection data over the study area. By doing so, 
we  obtained  12  surfaces  of  the  Shape  extrapolation  metric  for  both 
WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month. 

2.6. Methodological comparison

over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

earlier, the quality of the downscaling predictions is clearly limited by 
the  quality  of  the  native  coarse-grained  product.  Lembrechts  et  al. 
(2019)  incurred  a  similar  limitation  when  they  employed  CHELSA 
bioclimatic  variables  at  native  (30  arcsecs)  and  downscaled  (30  m) 
resolutions to model the distribution of 50 plant species, albeit to a far 
lesser degree. Although they obtained comparable performance between 
SDMs calibrated with CHELSA and with the topoclimatic interpolation 
of weather station data from Aalto et al. (2017), they nonetheless gained 
no substantial benefit from downscaling CHELSA compared to using its 
coarse-grained version. It is  finally worth recalling that CHELSA data 
covering  a  different  period  (1985–2000)  than  WorldClim  and  the 
weather  stations  (1970–2000)  could  contribute  to  CHELSA’s  lacking 
performance.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The papers mentioned do not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization or standardization of input features to ensure they have a consistent scale, handling missing values through imputation methods, encoding categorical variables if necessary, and potentially transforming skewed distributions to improve model performance. These steps can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of the deep learning model.
