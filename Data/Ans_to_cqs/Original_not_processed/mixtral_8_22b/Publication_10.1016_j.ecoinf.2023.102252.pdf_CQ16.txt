The condition score is then calculated using Eq. (9).

D0 is the wet spell duration required in a year for the ecological target to 
maintain good health, calculated as:

+ D0,min.

(6)  

D0,  min  defines the time taken for the ecological target to reach a con-
dition score of 1- ε from a condition score of 0. FERM then assumes that 
the time taken to reach a condition score of 1- ε is linear within respect to 
the condition score at the start of the wet spell. Epsilon is used to solve 
the asymptotic nature of the curve, which allows for physically-based 
parameterization.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the given information, there is no specific mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other stopping conditions. Therefore, it cannot be determined what criteria are used to decide when training is considered complete.
