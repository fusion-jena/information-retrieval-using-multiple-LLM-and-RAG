Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in any particular deep learning model. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are crucial components of deep learning models. They are typically mentioned in the methodology or experimental setup sections of research papers or articles discussing deep learning applications. Unfortunately, none of the provided references explicitly state the hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on this context, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
