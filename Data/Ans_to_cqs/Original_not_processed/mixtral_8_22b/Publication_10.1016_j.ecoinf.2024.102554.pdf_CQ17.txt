The  landscape  of  aquatic  environmental  monitoring  has  been 
notably transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with 
satellite data interpretation. Pioneering studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim 
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a significant leap in refining 
the  precision  of  satellite-derived  analytical  processes,  particularly  for 
the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al., 2022) have 
spearheaded  the  development of  sophisticated algorithms  tailored for 
atmospheric  correction,  optimized  for  application  with  data  from  the 
Sentinel-3 satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demon-
strate marked efficacy in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations 
within the optically complex waters of shallow lakes.

The latter algorithm to estimate the Chl-a (namely Chlor nn) is based 
on the Inverse Radiative Transfer Model-Neural Network (IRTM-NN) to 
estimate from normalised water-leaving reflectance at OLCI bands b440 
to b674, b709, θs and Δϕ. This algorithm relies on neural networks to 
address  the  problem  as  a  non-linear  multiple  regression  method  that 
drastically  reduces  computational  time,  once  the  network  is  properly 
trained  to  fit  the  coefficients.  Fortunately,  CMS  already  provides  the 
IRTM-NN model that outputs water-inherent optical properties such as 
total  backscattering  coefficient  (BBP443),  total  absorption  coefficient 
(ATOT443), phytoplankton absorption coefficient (APH443), coloured

rophyll  (Chl2)  concentration,  Total  Suspended  Matter  (TSM)  concen-
tration. We refer the reader to (Pahlevan et al., 2020) for insights.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of regularization might be applied due to the use of neural networks in the mentioned algorithms. Regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization could potentially be employed to avoid overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the specific regularization methods used in these algorithms, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
