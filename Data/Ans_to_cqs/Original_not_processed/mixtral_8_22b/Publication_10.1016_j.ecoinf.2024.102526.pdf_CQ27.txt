%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain specific details on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized into a format such as ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, or PyTorch TorchScript. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for predictions. As for platform selection, this depends on the use case and available resources. For example, if the goal is to perform real-time object detection using the model, then a GPU-enabled edge device might be chosen. On the other hand, if the focus is on batch processing large amounts of data, a cloud-based solution like AWS EC2 instances with GPUs could be more suitable. In summary, while the exact steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model cannot be determined from the given context, typical processes involve model serialization and selecting an appropriate platform based on the intended application and available resources.
