To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is semantic segmentation or pixel-wise classification. This method is used to locate and delineate both artificial and natural objects in photographs. It enables the extraction of meaningful information from images, such as the detailed delineation of the skyline required for their study. However, due to the loss of effective spatial resolution during the learning process, edges or object boundaries tend to become blurred. To overcome this issue, the authors apply a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) technique, which helps capture fine details and compensates for the limitations of neural networks in generating precisely delineated objects.
