(2)  Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly 
extracted. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate 1800 
sample points in the image of the study area for each year (300 
sample  points  for  each  land  cover  type).  These  sample  points 
were imported into the GEE application programming interface 
(API)  for  further  analysis.  The  samples  were  then  randomly 
divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The 
random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land 
use types in the study area.  

(3)  Post-classification  processing  was  applied  to  the  images.  A 
manual  visual  interpretation  approach  was  used  to  correct  the 
image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer 
zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effec-
tively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves 
resulting from “spectral confusion”.

3.3. Landscape fragmentation index 

To  evaluate  the  number  of  land  cover  types,  distances  between 
patches of the same land cover type, and the degrees of aggregation and 
segmentation, we selected four commonly used landscape metrics: the 
number of patches per area (km2) (patch density, PD), the percentage of 
landscape area occupied by the largest patch (largest patch index, LPI), 
the spatial context of individual patches weighted by relative patch area 
(area-weighted  mean  Euclidean  nearest-neighbor  distance,  ENN_AM), 
and the degree of aggregation of patches of the same type (aggregation 
index, AI). These indices are described in greater detail, including their 
formulas and ecological significance, in the Fragstats v4.2 help files and

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not directly discuss addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some relevant techniques such as stratified sampling and random sampling. In the study, 1800 sample points were generated randomly in the image of the study area for each year, with 300 sample points for each land cover type. These sample points were then divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. Although this is not explicitly stated as a method to address data bias, stratifying the dataset based on land cover types can potentially reduce bias towards any particular land cover type. Additionally, the use of random sampling could also help mitigate potential biases in the dataset. Other common methods to address data bias include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned in the given context.
