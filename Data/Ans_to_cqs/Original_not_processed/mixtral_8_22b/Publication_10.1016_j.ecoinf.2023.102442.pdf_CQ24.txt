18. Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) - In order to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (that are usually 
1–2 pixels in size), the minimum size of a mine for this step of the model was deemed as 3 pixels in size (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image). It is a 
common occurrence in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale, to contain isolated, misclassified individual pixels. Therefore, 
only mines above 2700 m2 were selected, removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies to ensure the 
most accurate result could be achieved.

due  to  ASGM  compared  to  industrial  mining.  The  results  demonstrate  the  potential  of  this  approach  that  le-
verages cloud-based machine learning with a semi-automated reclassification to allow for rapid, accurate, and 
potentially global mining detection.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that some strategies might have been used indirectly within these studies. For instance, one common strategy to manage randomness is cross-validation, which involves splitting data into multiple subsets and training models on different combinations of these subsets. This technique helps reduce overfitting and provides more robust performance estimates. Another method is ensemble learning, where multiple models are trained independently and their predictions combined to produce a final output. Ensemble methods help mitigate the effects of random initialization and improve overall accuracy. Additionally, techniques like grid search or randomized search can be applied during hyperparameter tuning to find optimal configurations across various random seeds. Lastly, using pretrained models or transfer learning can also minimize the impact of random initializations since they provide a good starting point for further fine-tuning. While none of these strategies are explicitly mentioned in the given context, they may still play a role in handling randomness when developing deep learning pipelines for tasks such as mapping artisanal and small-scale mines or classifying land use and land cover types.
