5.4. Limitations and future studies 

Due to the limitations of data sources and classification methods (Jia 
et al., 2023), this may largely affect the in-deep understanding of various 
mangrove species status in China and globally. In addition, although this 
study  discussed  the  effects  of  governmental  policies  on  long-term 
mangrove  evolution,  it  was  still  difficult  to  quantify  the  contribution 
rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration. Future dis-
cussion  and  in-deep  study  of  quantifiable  policy  factors  as  well  as 
improved  image  resolution  and  machine  learning  approaches  toward 
accurate identification of mangrove species will be great significance for 
dynamic monitoring and evaluation of mangrove interspecies evolution.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The papers cited do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build their models. However, some clues can be found in the paper by Lassalle et al. (2022). They discuss using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very high-resolution satellite imagery. While they do not specify the exact framework used, popular choices for building CNN architectures include TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, the paper by Liang et al. (2023) mentions using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for analyzing land use/cover change dynamics. Although GEE is not a deep learning framework itself, it can be integrated with other tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing deep learning applications. Therefore, while there is no definitive answer, it is likely that one or both of these popular deep learning frameworks were employed in the research.
