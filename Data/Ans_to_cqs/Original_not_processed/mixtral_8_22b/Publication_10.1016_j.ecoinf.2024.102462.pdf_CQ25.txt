the  experts.  Then  the  network  is  fed  this  annotated  data  and  the  pa-
rameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. 
Once this training process is finished, the model is ready to process new 
unseen  data.  DL  networks  are,  thus,  able  to  capture  statistics  and  re-
lationships directly from the data following human expertise. If the data 
used  for  training  the  model  is  representative  of  the  problem  and  the 
annotations are carefully generated, the resulting network can perform 
at a similar level with any input data set. This capacity to translate the 
training to other independent datasets is called the generalization power 
of the network. In practice, differences in performance between the re-
sults with the training data (or data that is similar to it, i.e., from the 
same  site  and  acquired  at  the  same  time)  and  those  of  independent 
datasets (often in research papers referred to as the testing data set) can

3.3. Automatic image processing using DL 

In this section we described the methodology we used to integrate DL 
models into our study. As this is the core technology of our automatic 
framework, we also provide detailed explanations on the metrics used to 
evaluate the results of the whole study.

Image classification using deep learning

to practical ecological applications. In particular, it is crucial to provide 
results  that  indicate  how  useful  the  trained  networks  would  be  in 
practical  scenarios.  This  can  be  very  challenging  due  to  the  ease  of 
obtaining high values of commonly used metrics, such as classification 
accuracy, that do not always represent the whole picture missing some 
subtle errors on important species as detailed above.

In order to solve this problem, we used a DL approach. DL networks 
can be seen as non-linear functions with a large number of parameters. 
The parameters of each DL are adjusted using annotated data (usually 
referred  to  as  a  “supervised  approach”).  Once  this  process  (called 
training the network) is finished, the evaluation of the network on the real 
problem  is  performed  by  feeding  it  an  independent  data  set  not  seen 
during training (the testing data set). DL techniques are currently a hot 
topic in machine learning with applications in a variety of fields, and are 
considered the current state of the art for CV applications. In fact, in 
some disciplines, this technology is considered to have exceeded human 
capabilities (Buetti-Dinh et al., 2019; He et al., 2015).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is image classification. Deep learning networks are utilized as non-linear functions with numerous parameters. These parameters are fine-tuned using annotated data, often referred to as a supervised approach. After the training process, the network's performance is evaluated by providing it with an unseen dataset, known as the testing data set. Deep learning techniques are widely applied across various fields and are regarded as the cutting edge for computer vision applications. In certain domains, these technologies are even believed to surpass human capabilities.
