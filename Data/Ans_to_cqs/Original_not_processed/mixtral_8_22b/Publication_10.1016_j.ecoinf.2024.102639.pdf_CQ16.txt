5.3.3. Results analysis and comparison 

The integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classification  algorithms  (see  (Bansal  et  al.,  2022; 
Boateng  et  al.,  2020)),  along  with  a  Principal  Component  Analysis- 
Support  Vector  Machine  (PCA-SVM)  hybrid  approach  (Hai  and  An, 
2016), has significantly enhanced our understanding of zebrafish and rat 
movements within T-maze environments. This comprehensive analysis, 
as  detailed  in  Tables  3  and  4,  showcases  the  detailed  insights  gained 
from these methodologies. For zebrafish, the KNN model demonstrated 
high precision and recall in identifying left movements, with impressive

Corollary  4.2. Consider  the  decision-making  model  as  defined  in  eq. 
(4.4). Let the mappings V 1, V 2 : X→X  satisfy the condition (2) of Defi-
nition 4.1 with parameters ℓ1  and ℓ2, respectively, ensuring that ℓ1 ≤ ℓ2. 
Furthermore, assume that Ξ⋆
:= (3 + ℓ4)ℓ2 < 1, and there exists a point ξ ∈
2
[0, 1] for  which  V 1(ξ) = V 2(ξ).  Additionally,  let  there  be  a  non-empty 
subset ℰ of the space S := {P ∈ C |P(1) ≤ 1 }, which forms a Banach space 
with the structure (ℰ, ‖ ⋅ ‖) as defined in (4.3)). Under these conditions, a 
singular solution exists for the model (4.4). Moreover, the sequence {Pn}, 
starting from any P0  in ℰ, converges to a unique solution of the model (4.4). 
The iterative process for this convergence is given by: 

Pn(x) = f(x)Pn(cid:0) 1(V 1(x) ) + (1 (cid:0)

f(x) )Pn(cid:0) 1(V 2(x) ), ∀n ∈ ℕ.

4.4. Convergence analysis

Turab and Sintunavarat expanded the previous work by introducing 
the  following  novel  functional  equation  to  model  a  specific  type  of 
learning behavior (see (Turab and Sintunavarat, 2020)) 

P(x) = xP(α1x + (1 (cid:0) α1)λ1 ) + (1 (cid:0) x)P(α2x + (1 (cid:0) α2)λ2 )

(2.5)  

for every x ∈ [0, 1], where P : [0, 1]→ℝ represents an unknown function, 
0 < α1 ≤ α2 < 1, and both λ1, λ2  lie within the interval [0, 1]. The func-
tional  eq.  (2.5)  models  the  phenomenon  of  emotional  resilience 
observed in a controlled experimental setup, involving a small enclosure 
with a steel grid floor, designed to study learning behaviors in dogs. 

Subsequent  research  into  human  and  animal  behavior  within  the 
context of probabilistic learning theory has yielded numerous results in 
this area of study (see (Debnath, 2021; George et al., 2022; Schein, 1954; 
Turab et al., 2022a; Turab et al., 2022b; Turab et al., 2023; Turab and 
Sintunavarat, 2023)).

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete involve the use of cross-validation error and the explained variance ratio. Specifically, the selection of the distance metric, such as Euclidean, is predicated on the data's characteristics and the specific analytical prerequisites. Furthermore, the number of components selected for dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is dictated by the explained variance ratio. This ensures that the distilled dataset retains the majority of the original data's variance.

For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type (linear) are calibrated through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation. The goal here is to mediate the balance between model complexity and its generalization prowess. In other words, the optimal values for 'C' and the kernel type are determined based on their impact on the model's performance during cross-validation.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the completion of training is determined by achieving a satisfactory level of cross-validation error and explained variance ratio. However, the exact threshold or criteria for determining this satisfactory level are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
