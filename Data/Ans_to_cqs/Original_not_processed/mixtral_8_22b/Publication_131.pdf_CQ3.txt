2.2. CNN Classiﬁcation System

In order to carry out the design of the CNN classiﬁcation system, a set of stages
were followed. These stages are represented in Figure 9 and described in the following
subsections.

Figure 9. Stages in the classiﬁcation system.

Each of the stages was programmed with Python using the Keras library [30] for CNNs.

2.2.1. Data Augmentation

In order to generate a more robust training set, an augmentation process was carried
out using the sound database. When one deals with CNN and images, data augmenta-
tion consists of extending the set of images from their transformations (rotations, size
modiﬁcations, etc.). For the purpose of the present work on sounds, the transformations
must be made on the audios, and later these transformations will be reﬂected in the
mel-spectrogram images.

In this way, for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios

were generated:

ﬁlters per convolution layer is 32 for the ﬁrst one, 64 for the second one, and 128 for the
ﬁnal one. A kernel size (height and width of the convolution window) of 3 × 3 is used
on each convolution layer. The fully connected layer (FC) consists of 512 neurons and
the softmax layer with the number of units for classiﬁcation (one for each type of sound).
Figure 11 shows the structure of the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20%
as tests. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning
model and prevent overﬁtting. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set. For
it, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was
selected for each type of anuran call. Thus, 7623 samples were used for training and 1892
for testing.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it describes the use of data augmentation techniques applied to audio samples in the context of designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification system.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to existing data. In this case, the authors have applied data augmentation to audio samples to create a more robust training dataset for their CNN model. They mention generating 10 additional audio samples for each original audio sample through various transformations like time stretching, pitch shifting, adding noise, and changing volume.

While this approach does not directly relate to traditional image-based data annotation techniques mentioned in the query, it still contributes to improving the performance of the deep learning model by increasing the diversity of the training data. It should also be noted that the context focuses solely on audio data processing rather than visual data, which might involve different types of annotations like bounding boxes or instance segmentation.
