prevent  potential  performance  degradation  of  the  model  and  avoids 
overfitting, which can limit the ability to make good extrapolations to 
unseen regions (Duque-Lazo et al., 2016). In this study, we employed 
two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: 1) RFE 
(Recursive  Feature  Elimination,  Khun,  2022)  and  2)VSURF  (Variable 
Selection Using Random Forests; Genuer et al., 2022). In RFE, the user 
defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algo-
rithm  iteratively  removes  one  variable  at  a  time  while  evaluating  its 
impact  on  the  model’s  performance.  This  process  continues  until  the 
algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In 
this study, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination 
condition. As a result, RFE retained all variables whose removal led to a 
deterioration in the best RMSE value. VSURF follows a three-step pro-

those conditions (Gutzwiller and Serno, 2023; Muckley et al., 2023). We 
expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

Among the many machine learning techniques, here we selected the 
classical random forest method due to its well-documented success in 
predicting the abundance of other disease vectors, such as mosquitoes. 
To enhance the precision of our method, we implemented two feature 
elimination  techniques  namely,  Recursive  Feature  Elimination  (RFE;

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses the use of two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help prevent potential performance degradation of the model and avoid overfitting by removing unnecessary features from the dataset. However, these techniques do not fall under the category of optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam.
