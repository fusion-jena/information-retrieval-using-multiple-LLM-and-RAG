predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

SOC values of the validation dataset to analyze its relative effectiveness

the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts towards achieving this goal.

Firstly, the use of diverse datasets is implied when mentioning the combination of multiple data sources to improve overall prediction accuracy. This suggests that the model was trained on varied inputs, which could contribute to its ability to generalize better.

Secondly, the text mentions that the accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)'s training process depends on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset. This implies that care was taken to ensure the dataset used for training was robust and comprehensive.

Thirdly, the process of determining the number of hidden layers and neurons through trial and error indicates an attempt to optimize the network's structure. This optimization process could potentially lead to a more generalizable model.

Lastly, the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for analyzing the relative effectiveness of the model suggests that some form of validation was performed. While the text does not explicitly state whether cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were employed, these are common practices in machine learning to assess a model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Therefore, while the text does not directly address the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it provides hints that such considerations were likely part of the development process.
