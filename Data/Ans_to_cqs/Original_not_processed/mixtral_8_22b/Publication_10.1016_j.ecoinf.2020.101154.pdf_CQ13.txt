2.4.2.  Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually. As a starting point the 
learning rate was set as low as possible and the number of iterations as 
high as computationally feasible (Hastie et al., 2009). The learning rate, 
which is also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution 
of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth which reflects the 
degree of interaction in the model is usually low. GBRT performs best 
using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps.

For  the  RI  models  the  same  initial  parameters  were  set  for  the 
analysis of the CS and NW datasets, then a grid search was performed 
on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the 
highest level of accuracy. These were as following: learning rate 0.05 
and maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and the NW models. The 
early stopping technique was used to determine when to stop the model 
training  to  avoid  overfitting.  Using  early  stopping  the  number  of 
iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW. 
Grid search was not required for a three-part splits, and further tuning 
of the parameters was done manually. 

For the RY models, in contrast to the RI models, the best performing 
models (based on MSE) were models with a slow learning rate of 0.005. 
Additionally, the NW model had a very shallow tree (tree depth of 2). 
The number of iterations was kept at 500.

The  tuned  hyperparameters  of  the  final  models  are  shown  in

Number of iterations was defined by early stopping. Subsample rate was 0.75% 
in  all  cases.  Parameters  for  2-part  split  were  defined  through  grid  search, 
whereas parameters for 3-part split were tuned manually.

For the two-part split hyperparameters were tuned using grid search 
which performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values 
for  an  estimator.  Grid  search  takes  a  set  of  possible  values  for  each 
hyperparameter that should be tuned and evaluates a model trained on 
each  element  of  the  Cartesian  product  of  the  sets. It  is  an  exhaustive 
search that trains and evaluates a model for each possible combination 
of  the  hyperparameter  values  supplied.  This  algorithm  automatically 
generates the validation sets internally. So there is no need to generate 
a validation set to select the best model.

The text does not provide information about a deep learning model but rather discusses Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. For these models, several hyperparameters have been mentioned and tuned.

In the case of the RI models, the learning rate was set to 0.05, and the maximum tree depth was set to 4 for both the CS and NW models. Early stopping was employed to prevent overfitting, resulting in 120 iterations for the CS model and 106 iterations for the NW model. A subsample rate of 0.75% was applied in all cases.

For the RY models, a slower learning rate of 0.005 was found to perform better. Additionally, the NW model utilized a very shallow tree with a depth of 2. The number of iterations was maintained at 500.

These hyperparameters were determined either through manual tuning or via grid search, depending on the specifics of the dataset and the desired outcome.
