4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model. 

4.4. FMOP model 

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

5.2. Land type conversion drivers 

We  added  the  extracted  land  type  expansion  raster  to  LEAS  and 
imported  the  driver  raster  map.  Subsequently,  the  RFC  was  used  to 
obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for 
each land category. We also set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of 
decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random 
forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution 
speed. In summary, the contribution rates and root mean square errors 
of each driving factor to the expansion of each land type were obtained 
(Fig. 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis 
of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the 
years  2000–2010  and  2010–2020  was  less  than  0.2,  and  the  model 
performed well. 

The higher the variable contribution rate is, the greater the impact of

cropland to forests and grasslands has been adequately promoted in our 
framework. The monitoring system has improved, and the restoration of 
degraded grasslands and the integration and optimization of different 
types  of  nature  reserves  have  been  incorporated.  Finally,  further 
research and improvement are needed in the mathematical modeling of 
the objective function of the MOP model, the selection of uncertainty 
methods, and the experimentation of prediction methods. Attempts can 
be  made  to  remodel  the  MOP  model  using  models  such  as  interval 
planning  and  chance-constrained  planning,  and  machine  learning 
methods can be used to process the time series data.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) was used to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category. Additionally, the number of decision trees was set to 20, the number of features used to train the random forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution speed. These settings could potentially help monitor the model performance during training by providing insights into the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it is not possible to definitively state what specific strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
