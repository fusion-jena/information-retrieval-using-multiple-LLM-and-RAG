3.  Through  the  use  of  the  online  platform  Zooniverse,  we  collected  multiple  non-

expert counts by citizen scientists and used three different aggregation methods 

to  obtain  a  single  count  for  the  survey  images.  We  also  counted  the  images  by 

developing a bespoke deep learning method via the use of a convolutional neural 

network. The results of both approaches were then compared.

curate total estimates. The deep learning method was far faster and appears to be 

a more reliable and predictable approach; however, we note that citizen science 

volunteers played an important role when creating training data for the algorithm. 

Notably, our results show that accurate, species-specific, automated counting of 

aerial wildlife images is now possible.
