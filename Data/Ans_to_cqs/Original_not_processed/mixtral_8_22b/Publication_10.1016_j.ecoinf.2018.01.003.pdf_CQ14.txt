Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

The SVM method is developed from statistical learning theory,
which minimizes the error involved with sample size and narrows the
upper limit of the error involved in model generalization to solve the
problems of over-learning, nonlinearity and the curse of dimensionality
during modeling (Howley and Madden, 2005; Huang and Wang, 2006;
Kohavi and John, 1997). In addition, the kernel function, which is used
to overcome nonlinearity, and the curse of dimensionality play a critical
role in the SVM method. The SVM method is a bridge from linear to
nonlinear that replaces the inner product operation in a high-dimen-
sional feature space to reduce the dimensional complexity of the cal-
culation. Currently, the most commonly used kernel functions include
the polynomial kernel function, the radial basis function, the ex-
ponential radial basis function, and the multilayer perceptron kernel
function (Ahmad et al., 2008; Burges and Christopher, 1998). Because

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, there are several common methods for optimizing hyperparameters such as Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc. Without specific information about the model or the context, it cannot be determined which method was used for hyperparameter optimization.

Unhelpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a combination of grid search and random search techniques. This approach allowed for a thorough exploration of the parameter space while also ensuring that the optimal solution could be found efficiently. Additionally, cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter configurations and select the best one.
