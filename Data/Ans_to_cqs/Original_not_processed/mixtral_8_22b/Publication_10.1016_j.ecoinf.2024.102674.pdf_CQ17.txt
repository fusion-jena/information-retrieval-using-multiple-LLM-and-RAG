over five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We fitted 
RFs using the RANDOMFOREST R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) with 500 
trees, five as the minimum size of terminal nodes, and by sampling all 
descriptors for splitting at each node; these RFs were thus equivalent to 
bagged decision trees. Finally, we fitted GBMs via the  GBM  R package 
(Greenwell et al., 2020) by ensembling a maximum of 10,000 trees, with 
shrinkage and interaction parameters equal to 0.01 and 1, respectively; 
each  tree  was  thus  equivalent  to  a  decision  stump.  After  model  cali-
bration, we identified the most relevant physiographic descriptors for 
each algorithm and each month. For GAMs, we evaluated the predictors’ 
relative importance by considering their F statistics. We assessed vari-
able importance in ANNs by employing the Olden method (Olden et al., 
2004)  implemented  in  the  NEURALNETTOOLS  R  package  (Beck,  2018).

downscalings extrapolated by comparing the training data at the cali-
bration points with the projection data over the study area. By doing so, 
we  obtained  12  surfaces  of  the  Shape  extrapolation  metric  for  both 
WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month.

For each monthly climate dataset, we assessed the quality of the in-
terpolations via leave-one-out cross-validation. Therefore, each weather 
station was excluded once from the dataset and used as a validation point. 
The quality of the downscalings was evaluated by calibrating the algo-
rithms on the set of centroids of each monthly climate raster and then 
cross-validating them on the weather stations’ locations. The predictive 
performance of the techniques was compared by using four validation 
metrics, namely the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) scores, percent biases 
(pbias),  mean  absolute  errors  (MAE),  and  root-mean-square  errors 
(RMSE). KGE is a composite measure that simultaneously accounts for 
correlation, variability errors, and bias errors among observed and pre-
dicted data (Gupta et al., 2009) and was calculated as follows: 

KGE = 1 (cid:0)

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general insights can be derived from the information available.

In the context of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), regularization techniques are often employed to avoid overfitting. In the case of RFs, bagging or bootstrap aggregating is used, which involves creating multiple subsets of the original data and fitting a separate decision tree to each subset. This helps reduce variance and improve prediction accuracy.

For GBMs, shrinkage and interaction parameters are mentioned, which could imply the use of regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization. Shrinkage reduces the influence of individual trees in the ensemble, while interaction parameters control the complexity of interactions between features. These techniques help prevent overfitting by reducing the model's complexity and improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

However, it should be noted that the context does not provide direct evidence of the use of specific regularization methods commonly associated with deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to the removal of any single feature. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing any single weight from becoming too large, thereby reducing overfitting.

In conclusion, based on the given context, while there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, the use of techniques such as bagging for RFs and shrinkage/interaction parameters for GBMs suggests that regularization may have been applied to prevent overfitting. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if methods like dropout or L2 regularization were specifically utilized.
