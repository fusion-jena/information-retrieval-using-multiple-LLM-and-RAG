3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances. 

3.3. Deep learning vs traditional machine learning comparison 

A comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine

Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

As expected for the retrieval task performed with deep features, the 
similarity  measure  influences  the  retrieval  performances,  and  for  our 
problem, the best one seems to be the Euclidean distance (See Table 6 
and 7). Even a little less effective than for classification, the results can 
be considered satisfying and confirm the potential use of deep learning 
techniques for retrieval tasks. Overall, our proposed model turns out to 
be the most performing among the considered networks.

dataset.  A  detailed  description  of  the  CNN  network  is  provided  in 
Table 1. The network has proven to have the same accuracy performance 
as more complex and deeper networks but with a shallow training time, 
as shown in the next section.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model proposed in this study is primarily for single seed classification and retrieval. The model, named SeedNet, is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and consists of six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional, and the last one is fully connected. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of each convolutional layer. To manage the number of parameters and computations within the network, thereby controlling overfitting, max pooling layers are inserted between consecutive convolutional layers. The input image size is set at 224 x 224 x 3. Depending on the selected dataset, the final fully connected layer outputs to an N-way softmax, generating a probability distribution across the N class labels to forecast, specifically 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local datasets. This model has been demonstrated to achieve comparable accuracy to more intricate and deeper networks while requiring significantly shorter training times.
