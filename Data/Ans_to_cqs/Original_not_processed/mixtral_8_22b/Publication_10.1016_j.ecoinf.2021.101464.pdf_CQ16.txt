In order to ensure the accuracy of the final model, the intermediate 
prediction model needed to fulfill the criteria P value <0.01, and the 
corresponding validation samples were used to test each intermediate 
model, while the correlation coefficients between the observed values 
and the estimated values in the validation samples were calculated. If 
there was a significant correlation between the observed values and the 
predicted values in the independent samples, the prediction ability of 
the model was better.

3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

(RF) model, and the results are shown in Fig. 4, which shows that the 
RMSE between the measured and fitting values is 146.202 and 117.430 
ion/cm3, and  the  linear correlation  R2  is  0.275 and  0.980,  indicating 
that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect. 
In addition, to further verify the model’s stability, independent test data 
were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation, and the results 
are shown in Table 5. For that test, the average R2  was 0.931 and the 
average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, reaffirming that the RF model has 
high simulation accuracy and good stability. 

4. Discussion

the values of M (the number of input variables is 1–11) until M corre-
sponds to the smallest model error. Fig. 1a shows that when M was 7, the 
model  error  reached  the  minimum.  Further,  the  Nt  in  the  RF  model 
avoided potential overfitting as follows. First, Nt was set to 500, and the 
operation results are shown in Fig. 1b, which shows that the model error 
tended to be stable after Nt reached 200. Therefore, the final M and Nt 
were 7 and 200, respectively. (See Fig. 2.)

Helpful Answer:
To determine when training is complete, the given context mentions several criteria related to the Random Forest (RF) model. However, it does not explicitly state a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau. Instead, it focuses on optimizing parameters and evaluating the performance of the RF model using various metrics.

From the context, we can infer that the following steps are taken to evaluate the model's performance and determine its readiness:

1. Importance Scores: Variables are ranked based on their importance scores obtained through simulations. This helps identify the most relevant features contributing to the model's predictions.

2. Proportion of Explained Variance: The intermediate models established by the RF show that the proportion of explained variance is between 91% and 92%. A higher percentage indicates that the model effectively captures the variability in the target variable.

3. Correlation Coefficients: The correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted values in the independent samples are calculated. A significant correlation suggests that the model has good predictive power.

4. Cross-Validation: To assess the model's stability and generalization capabilities, 10-fold cross-validation is performed using independent test data. The mean R2 and RMSE values from this process provide insights into the model's overall performance and reliability.

Based on these evaluation methods, one could argue that training is considered complete when the model demonstrates satisfactory performance across all these aspects. However, the context does not specify any particular threshold or stopping condition for determining when training should cease.
