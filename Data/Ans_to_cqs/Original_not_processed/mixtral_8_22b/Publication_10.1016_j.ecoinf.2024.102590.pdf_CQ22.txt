For assessing the variable importance of the 18 GLCM texture met-
rics, we utilized the “ee.classifier.explain” algorithm and then calculated 
the relative importance of each metric. In contrast to other image clas-
sification  software,  the  segmentation  process  is  performed  after  the 
training dataset is created, therefore, the objects obtained from the SNIC 
algorithm (Section 2.3.3) are then labeled with the corresponding LC 
labels of the training points collected in Section 2.3.2 as preparation for 
image  classification  with  the  chosen  classifier.  Therefore,  using  the 
Random Forest together with the GLCM texture metrics (independent 
variables) and the training samples identified with LC labels (dependent 
variable), we classified all other segmented objects into woody or non- 
woody LC to obtain the final woody cover classification image. 

2.3.5. Accuracy, export, and land cover count

After  each  aerial  image  was  classified,  we  evaluated  the  accuracy 
metrics using a confusion matrix in GEE to summarize the performance 
of  our  classification  workflow  (Radoux  et  al.,  2008).  Factors  that 
affected  the  measurement  of  accuracy  included  the  resolution  of  the 
aerial images, the training/validation dataset, and the LC classes chosen. 
Accuracy assessment of the performance of the Random Forest classifi-
cation  yields  values  ranging  from  0%  (no  match)  to  100%  (complete 
match) (Lillesand et al., 2004). Overall accuracy reflects the percentage 
of correctly classified pixels in a map, but it does not show how errors 
are distributed among different land cover classes. To address this, we 
calculated producer’s accuracy, which gauges the correctness of refer-
ence  pixel  classification,  and  user’s  accuracy,  which  indicates  how 
accurately  the  classification  represents  actual  ground  conditions.  To

The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the authors use several metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model. These metrics include overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. Overall accuracy reflects the percentage of correctly classified pixels in a map, while producer's accuracy measures the correctness of reference pixel classification. On the other hand, user's accuracy indicates how accurately the classification represents actual ground conditions. It should be noted that these metrics are commonly used in remote sensing and geospatial analysis to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. However, depending on the specific application and requirements, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score may also be relevant.
