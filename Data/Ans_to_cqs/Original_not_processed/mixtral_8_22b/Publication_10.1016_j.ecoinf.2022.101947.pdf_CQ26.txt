team. The track ID method, based on an objective approach described by 
Sharma et al., 2005, failed because survey teams were unable to obtain 
enough data at the field site during the study period.

mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Data validation was performed on the captive Amur tiger dataset to 
determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algo-
rithm training set and test sets that could provide an accurate population 
estimate. Fig. 4 shows the result of a holdback trial partitioning test on 
training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. Using the algorithm generated 
in FIT, the analysis was iterated 10 times for each combination of test/ 
training  size,  with  randomly  selected  trails,  to  examine  how  the  pre-
dicted outcome compared with the known test set size. The figure shows, 
for example, that then the test set size (y axis) comprises trails from 4 
tigers, and the test/training set size comprises trails from 04/40 tigers, 
the predicted test set sizes are very similar across a range of partitioning 
trials. However, when the test set size is 36 tigers, and the test/training 
ratio 36/08 tigers, there is a wide range of predicted test set sizes and the

Whilst the basic approach of the pugmark technique led to inaccur-
acies of population estimates, we have demonstrated in this study that a 
robust  and  statistically  valid  approach  such  as  FIT,  if  included  in  a 
methodological  framework  that  can  satisfy  sampling-based  survey 
methodology requirements (Gopalaswamy et al., 2019), has the poten-
tial to be a useful tool to provide optimal census and monitoring capa-
bility through tiger ranges. When FIT is used by data collection teams 
that have even rudimentary tracking skills, it can overcome the reser-
vations put forward about the use of footprints for conservation moni-
toring (Karanth et al., 2003). For  example, field operatives with very 
basic  training  or  accompanied  by  trackers  can  identify  left  and  right 
hind footprints and collect images according to the FIT protocol (an app 
is being developed to collect the necessary images with smartphones).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information can be extracted from the given context.

In the first piece of context, it mentions that the track ID method failed due to insufficient data collected at the field site. This suggests that having enough data is crucial for successful implementation of the method. Inadequate data might lead to biased results, which can be mitigated by collecting diverse data.

The second piece of context discusses the relationship between the test set size and the training set size. It states that optimal classification accuracy was achieved when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set. This implies that balancing the class distribution within datasets may improve performance. Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can help achieve balanced classes.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the same proportions of target variables as in the original dataset. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority class samples, while undersampling reduces the frequency of majority class samples. These methods aim to reduce imbalance in the dataset, thus minimizing potential bias.

Although the text does not explicitly mention these techniques, they align with the principles discussed in the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could potentially be employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
