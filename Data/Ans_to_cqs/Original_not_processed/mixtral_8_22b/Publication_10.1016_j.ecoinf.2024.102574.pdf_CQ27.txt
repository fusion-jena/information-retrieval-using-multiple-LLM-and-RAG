%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about a specific deep learning model or its deployment process. Therefore, it is not possible to provide details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
