Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better
accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including
ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized
in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better ﬁt the occurrence scenarios of the
species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including
MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS.
The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve
(AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68
with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for
species distribution over BIOCLIM.

Convolution is used for feature extraction, in which a kernel is applied to an input
tensor. A feature map is thus obtained through the product of kernel elements and tensor
input. The procedure is then repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. The hyperparameters involved in convolution
operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to
5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the information provided, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects can still be inferred. For instance, the use of various ecological and atmospheric variables derived from several satellite missions like MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS suggests a certain level of diversity in the dataset. Furthermore, the application of convolutional layers for feature extraction implies that the model has been designed to capture complex patterns within the data, potentially enhancing its ability to generalize. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, it remains unclear whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified sampling were employed to further improve the model's robustness and generalizability.
