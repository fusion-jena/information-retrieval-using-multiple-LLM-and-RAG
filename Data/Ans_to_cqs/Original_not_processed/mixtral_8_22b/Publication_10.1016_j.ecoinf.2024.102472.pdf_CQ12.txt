During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Helpful Answer:

In this case, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the model used is a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), which belongs to the family of artificial neural networks (ANNs).

The text mentions that during the MLPNN training phase, initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned, and inputs are fed forward from the input to the hidden layer. The results propagate to the output layer, where output values are compared to expected values for error computation. An iterative error back-propagation adjusts connection weights until reaching a target minimal error. The network is then able to estimate carbon stocks for both training and new input data without requiring additional training data.

Additionally, the reference to Domingues et al. (2020) further supports the use of ANNs, specifically mentioning their application in high-performance prediction using integrated multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Although the paper does not specify the exact architecture of the ANN used, it highlights the importance of selecting appropriate predictor variables and optimizing parameters such as learning rate, momentum, and number of training iterations.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model is not directly stated, the evidence suggests that the pipeline employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) as its primary machine learning component.
