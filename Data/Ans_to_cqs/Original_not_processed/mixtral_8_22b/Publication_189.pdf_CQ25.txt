This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

both  separately  and  give  instance  segmentation  as  output.  So, 
Mask R-CNN is a combination of Faster R-CNN and FCN [19] 
models with some advancements where a parallel layer of FCN 
is added for the mask implementation in the Faster R-CNN head  
along with some extra convolutional layers on each Region of 
Interest [20] (RoI). 

A.  Data Collection and Annotation 

The data usually is obtained by using different means like 
scraping  from  the  web,  downloading  from  other  sources  or 
buying datasets from re-sellers etc. In the proposed system, the 
dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom 
training.  To  collect  the  data  images,  a  KaKaXi  fixed  camera 
shown in Fig. 3 has been used which takes images every hour 
within a fixed period of time each day. These images then get 
saved in  a database.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is semantic segmentation and object detection. Specifically, it utilizes techniques such as Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Mask R-CNN, which combines elements of Faster R-CNN and FCNs for improved performance in tasks related to image segmentation and object detection. The primary goal of these models is to accurately identify and classify objects within images, as well as delineate their boundaries for precise localization.

In the case of semantic segmentation, the model aims to assign a specific label or category to each pixel in an input image, effectively creating a detailed map of the scene depicted. This can be particularly useful in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, and satellite image interpretation.

On the other hand, object detection focuses on identifying instances of predefined classes within an image and determining their locations through bounding boxes. By incorporating Mask R-CNN into the model, it not only detects objects but also generates accurate masks around them, providing more granular information about their shapes and sizes. This capability is valuable in various domains, including surveillance systems, facial recognition software, and industrial quality control processes.

Overall, the deep learning model described in the given context serves multiple purposes related to computer vision tasks, primarily focusing on semantic segmentation and object detection with enhanced precision due to its integration of advanced techniques like FCNs and Mask R-CNN.
