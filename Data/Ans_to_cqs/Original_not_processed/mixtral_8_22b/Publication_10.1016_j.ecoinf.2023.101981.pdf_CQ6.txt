different Sika Deer vocalizations (range 2â€“70%, Enari et al., 2019). A 
recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates 
of  approximately  90%  for  the  five  supervised  machine  learning  algo-
rithms tested, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could 
clearly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

is the FFT window size. We opted for a larger FFT window size, which 
should  improve  the  resolution  at  lower  frequencies  on  which  cows 
vocalize. Finally, while Karmiris et al. (2021) used the same settings for 
detecting  the  three  ungulate  species  (e.g.,  their  minimum  frequency 
introduced  for  detecting  cow  vocalization  was  much  higher,  500  Hz, 
than the mean minimum frequency measured in our dataset, approxi-
mately 250 Hz), we fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which 
could also partly explain why our model detected a much larger number 
of cow vocalizations.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. These may include data normalization, where the input features are scaled or transformed so they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale. Data cleaning is another important step, involving removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points. Scaling might also be applied to adjust all values within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1, to maintain consistency across different datasets. In some cases, additional transformations like logarithmic scaling or standardizing data might be necessary depending on the nature of the problem being addressed by the deep learning model.
