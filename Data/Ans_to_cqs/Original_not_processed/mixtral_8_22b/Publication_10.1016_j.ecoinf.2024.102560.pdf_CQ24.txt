The river runoff variation given in Fig. 8(a) shows a decrease in the 
volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3  to 700 Mm3, which means 
that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth. 
Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which 
can generally be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are 
related  to  human  activities,  which  include  excessive  use  of  water  re-
sources, excessive development of agriculture around the lake, and the 
structures built in the basin. One of the human activities is changing the 
cultivation  pattern  and  creating  unconventional  deep  wells  in  the  re-
gion, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of 
water-based  agricultural  products  increased  from  350,000  ha  to 
500,000 ha. The construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the 
catchment  water  of  the  lake,  which,  with  these  unplanned  dams  and

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. These strategies aim to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and robustness in model training and evaluation. Here are some common approaches:

1. Fixed Random Seed: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code runs. This helps in reproducing results consistently across different runs or machines. However, it should be noted that setting a fixed seed does not eliminate randomness but rather makes it deterministic.

2. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of random initialization by averaging out the performance over multiple folds. Each fold uses a different subset of the dataset for training and validation, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the model's generalization ability.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or hyperparameters can improve overall performance and stability. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking can be used to create ensembles of models, reducing the variance introduced by randomness.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Performing systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, can help find optimal configurations that minimize the impact of randomness. By exploring various combinations of hyperparameters, we can identify settings that lead to better and more consistent performance.

5. Regularization Techniques: Applying regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. These techniques introduce constraints during training, preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.
