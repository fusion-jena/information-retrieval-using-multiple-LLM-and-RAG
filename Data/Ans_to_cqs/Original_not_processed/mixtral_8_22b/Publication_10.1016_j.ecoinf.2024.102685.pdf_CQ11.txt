Fauzan, M.A., Wicaksono, P., Hartono, 2021. Characterizing Derawan seagrass cover

Random  Forest  is  a  machine  learning  method  combining  decision 
trees  and  bootstrapping.  Developed  by  Breiman  (2001),  RF  has  been 
found to be insensitive to overtraining, small or noisy datasets. Every 
decision tree in the implemented RF algorithm is trained with a boot-
strapped sample of the training data and, at every split node, a subset of 
randomly  selected  features  is  utilized.  Then  for  each  pixel,  the  final 
classification  is  obtained  by  a  majority  vote.  RF  has  proven  to  be  an 
effective tool for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats (Fauzan et al., 
2021; Traganos and Reinartz, 2018b; Wicaksono et al., 2019). Two sets 
of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 
2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of 
the total seagrass meadows (hereafter identified as seagrass meadows), 
where areas with <20% seagrass cover were considered absence (Valle
