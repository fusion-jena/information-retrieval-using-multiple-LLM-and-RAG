or in terms of certain traits, for example, toward species that are
typically considered more photogenic due to large colorful
ﬂowers or leaves. Search terms could be modiﬁed to either focus
on a speciﬁc sub-group, e.g., searching using scientiﬁc names,
or to exclude non-target images, e.g., excluding images that
include the words ‘‘show’’ or ‘‘garden’’ in their metadata. Finally,
high-level image classiﬁers could be trained to remove images
that are clearly not plants, for example, removing images of an-
imals, paintings. High-level classiﬁers developed to separate im-
ages that contain plants from those that do not, without looking
to identify species, could be used to ﬁnd images worthy of further
examination in large datasets that do not have metadata (such as
titles and descriptions),
removing the need for keyword
searches, such as that used in this study.

3. What is the appropriate taxonomic resolution for your
study? This will be driven by your research question, as
well as an assessment of the AI naturalist’s accuracy. Clas-
siﬁers will tend to be more accurate at higher taxonomic
levels, but this may vary between taxonomic groups.

4. What reporting biases exist in your dataset? For example,
to what degree are charismatic species over-represented,
or nocturnal species under-represented? Can you ﬁlter the
data, or model the results to account for these biases if
they are relevant?

5. Do reporting biases change over space or time? We
observed signiﬁcant differences in reporting bias between
urban and rural settings, and we anticipate that temporal
biases are likely to exist where public interest in elements
of the natural environment change over time.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves addressing the issue of internal covariate shift. Internal covariate shift refers to changes in the distribution of network activations caused by updates to the parameters during training. To mitigate this problem, techniques like Batch Normalization can be employed. Batch normalization is a method that normalizes the activations of each layer in the neural network, making the optimization process smoother and faster. It also helps reduce generalization error and improves the overall performance of deep learning models. Additionally, monitoring the gap between the training data and the test data on which the developed algorithms will be evaluated is crucial to ensure the model performs well when applied to new, unseen data.
