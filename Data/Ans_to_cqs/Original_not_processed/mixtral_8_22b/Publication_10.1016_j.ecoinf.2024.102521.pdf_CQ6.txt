4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  users’  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

dataset  (Fig.  4,  legend),  it  encompasses  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  insect 
diversity.  Thus,  STARdbi  provides  a  built-in  mechanism  for  users  to 
manually  label  some  of  their  images,  and  trigger  retraining.  These 
innovative features are not available in existing datasets of annotated 
insect  images  (e.g.,  Ciampi  et  al.,  2023;  Wang  et  al.,  2020).  We  also 
acknowledge the rapid development pace of general AI-based methods 
for  image  processing,  with  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  the  algorithms 
steadily improving. Thus, we aim to periodically replace the networks 
that are currently implemented in STARdbi by new state-of-the-art ones 
as better algorithms are released. With this in mind, we don’t focus on 
STARdbi’s performance compared to other AI software for insect iden-
tification. In fact, we welcome suggestions for improved models from

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, common practices often involve several preprocessing techniques depending on the nature of the dataset. Normalization can be applied to scale pixel values between 0 and 1 or use mean subtraction and division by standard deviation to ensure consistent input ranges. Scaling may include resizing images to fit network architecture requirements. Cleaning could refer to removing noise, irrelevant objects, or artifacts from images. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping might also be employed to increase the size and variety of the training dataset. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps are not mentioned explicitly in the given context, so they cannot be confirmed without further information.
