Looking beyond these data to improve the extensibility of investigations 
on the health of aquatic ecosystems is necessary (Upadhyay and Khan-
delwal,  2019;  Yuan  et  al.,  2017).  Deep  learning  techniques  have  the 
potential to be used to investigate parts of ecosystems. In this study, the 
TDI, BMI, and FAI were calculated using ecological monitoring data, and 
the status of the aquatic ecosystem was determined. Quantitative and 
qualitative  indices  may  constrain  further  applications,  such  as  grade 
prediction of aquatic ecosystem health. However, we demonstrated that 
the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is a potential candidate 
for  estimating  aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  compared  with  the 
original CNN and conventional machine learning models (Table 3). In 
other  words,  deep  learning  methods  can  be  applied  to  water  quality, 
hydraulic, and hydrological data to reflect the quantitative and quali-

learning of nonlinear data manifold. Neurocomputing 160, 250–260.

This study evaluated the potential of a deep learning approach for 
estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices. Water quality, hydraulic, 
and hydrological data, including 81 variables, were used as inputs for 
the  deep  learning  and  conventional  machine  learning  models.  The 
combination of CNN and autoencoder showed the best performance in 
estimating the TDI, BMI, and FAI values compared to the CNN without 
autoencoder, ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost. To understand the aquatic 
ecosystem, the complexity of the input data and health indices must be 
properly extracted by the abstract feature representation of a CNN with 
an autoencoder. Therefore, we demonstrated that deep neural networks 
could  be  an  alternative  and  sustainable  methodology  for  estimating 
aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices. In  future  studies, additional  inputs, 
such as remote sensing imagery, which has high spatiotemporal reso-

(Table 3). In addition, a cumulative density function (CDF) was devel-
oped  using  the  estimation  error  from  the  CNN  and  the  CNN  with  an 
autoencoder for aquatic ecosystem health indices (Fig. 6). The CNN with 
an autoencoder was superior to the CNN alone for all indices. The PBIAS 
values for TDI were 0.0114 and 0.0378, respectively, indicating a slight 
underestimation trend for the CNN with the autoencoder and the CNN 
(Fig. 6a). The CNN with an autoencoder showed a very low degree of 
overestimation with (cid:0) 0.00585 of PBIAS, the best performance among 
the health indices, whereas the CNN showed a BMI of 0.0325 (Fig. 6b). 
For FAI, similar values of PBIAS were obtained using the TDI estimation 
(Fig.  6c).  Moreover,  Kolmogorov–Smirnov  (KS)  provided  p-values  for 
aquatic  ecosystem  health  indices  lower  than  0.05,  indicating  signifi-
cantly different distributions between the results of CNN with autoen-
coder and CNN.
