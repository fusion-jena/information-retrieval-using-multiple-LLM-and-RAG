Table 6 presents the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of the 
five networks. ResNet50 surpasses the other models in terms of all of the 
evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 0.81, precision of 0.82, recall of 
0.81, and F1-score of 0.81 for the testing set. Considering the challenge 
of manual sample distinction, this result is commendable. Fig. 4 displays 
the  F1-scores  of  the  five  categories  across  all  of  the  networks,  with 
ResNet50 having the best values of the four categories, except for the 
RRP. Therefore, ResNet50 was selected for the case validation. 

After finalization, the model was applied to classify the case study 
area. The classification results correspond to the actual situation (Fig. 7). 
The RRP is primarily concentrated on the eastern and western edges of 
the study area, reflecting the history of top-down planning and devel-
opment in this area. The IRP is primarily situated in the central part of

4.2. Landscape type classification 

The  five  network  models  were  evaluated  using  the  performance 
metrics  of  the  validation  and  test  sets.  The  model  accuracy  was 
continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the 
performance of the testing set guided the final decision. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the  learning  curves,  indicating  a  reduction  in  training  losses  as  the 
number  of  epochs  increases  and  convergence  within  500  epochs. 
Inceptionv3  converges  by  400  epochs,  while  the  other  networks 
converge  within  150  epochs.  The  ResNet  architecture,  especially 
ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforms the others.

3.2.2. Method for measuring RSI 

The  improved  entropy  method,  which  mitigates  subjectivity  and 
information overlap, determines the RSI weight by assigning values to 
analytical  indicators  based  on  the  magnitude  of  their  information.  In 
contrast  to  conventional  entropy  methods,  which  tend  to  generate 
extreme  or  negative  values,  this  method  employs  standardization 
transformation to process indicator data and prevent measurement bias

The  workflow  based  on  deep  learning  methods  proposed  in  this 
paper  can  greatly  shorten  the  time  required  to  conduct  landscape 
characteristics classification, and the positive impact of using this pro-
cess  has  been  demonstrated  in  Section  4.3.  Overall,  we  explored  the 
potential of CNNs to classify perceptual cognitive metrics. The results of 
our study were consistent with those of previous studies (Chen et al., 
2021a; Meng et al., 2022), demonstrating the high applicability of CNNs 
even in the field of subjective cognition and further suggesting that the 
ResNet  architecture  has  robustness  and  generalization  capabilities.  In 
particular, we found a more prominent and significant correlation be-
tween  the  no-pattern  categories  compared  to  the  other  categories  in 
terms of their impacts on rural sustainability (the no-pattern category 
includes  samples  that  cannot  be  categorized  into  the  other  four  pat-

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help measure how well the model performs in predicting the correct classes. Table 6 provides the values of these metrics for each of the five networks considered in the study. For instance, VGG16 has an accuracy of 0.7689, precision of 0.7734, recall of 0.7636, and F1-score of 0.7679. Similarly, Inceptionv3, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101 have different values for these metrics. Among them, ResNet50 achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 0.8146, precision of 0.8197, recall of 0.8067, and F1-score of 0.8122.
