Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned in the table. However, it does mention that the data was collected over three years (autumn 2016-2018), which could suggest temporal diversity in the dataset. Additionally, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a score detection threshold of 0.95 implies some form of validation process, although details regarding this are not explicitly stated. The paper by Nolan et al. (2022) discusses the development of a CNN for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls, but again, no specific measures for ensuring generalizability are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the given context, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
