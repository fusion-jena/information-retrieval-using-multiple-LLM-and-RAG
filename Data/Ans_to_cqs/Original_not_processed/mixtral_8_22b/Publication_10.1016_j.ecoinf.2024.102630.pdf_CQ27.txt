2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the available information.

Based on general practices, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized or saved for later use. Serialization involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on various platforms such as web servers, mobile devices, or edge computing devices depending on the application requirements. However, without specific details regarding the model used in this study, I am unable to provide more detailed information about its deployment process.
