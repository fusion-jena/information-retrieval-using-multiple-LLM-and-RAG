TP+TN+FP+FN, the 
true positive rate, TPR = TP
TN+FP. 
We repeat this process for each group ending up with k values of these 
metrics. To measure the overall performance, we obtain the average of 
these metrics. Here, we carry out the analysis using k = 5.

machine  learning  methods:  Support  Vector  Machines,  Deep  Neural  Networks,  Long  Short  Term  Memory  and 
Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates 
in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement 
over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use 
a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the 
pypbp package.

Also, considering the influence of the model, we found that the rank 
of  models  in  which  our  method  produced  higher  performance  is, 
respectively, starting with the best one, the negative binomial (ϕ = 1.2), 
Gaussian, negative binomial (ϕ = 3) and Poisson stochastic models. On 
average, we obtain an accuracy of 84.6% with a standard deviation of 
20.5%, a false positive rate of 14.9% with a standard deviation of 24.2% 
and a true positive rate of 59.6% with a standard deviation of 42.0% for 
the  negative  binomial  (ϕ = 1.2)  model.  Considering  the  Gaussian 
model, we obtained an accuracy of 75.2% with a standard deviation of 
18.0%, a false positive rate of 22.9% with a standard deviation of 22.2% 
and a true positive rate of 55.5% with a standard deviation of 37.3%. 
This finding makes our method a promising prediction tool since we got 
good results even when using stochastic approaches to simulate the data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include the true positive rate (TPR), also known as sensitivity or recall, calculated as TP/(TP + FN); the false positive rate (FPR), calculated as FP/(TN + FP); and accuracy, calculated as (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). Additionally, the text discusses averaging these metrics over multiple groups (k=5) to assess overall performance. However, it does not explicitly mention other common evaluation metrics like precision or specificity.
