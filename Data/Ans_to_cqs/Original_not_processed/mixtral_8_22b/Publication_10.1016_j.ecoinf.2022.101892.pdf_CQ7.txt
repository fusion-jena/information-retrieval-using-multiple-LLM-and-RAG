different VGG nets, such as VGG-11, VGG-16, and VGG-19. VGG-16 has 
been applied in many researches and it is often used to extract features in 
the age estimation tasks Pan et al. (2018). In this study, we replaced the 
last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with 
one FC layer to reduce parameters. And we adopt Batch Normalization 
(BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) to accelerate the training of networks. 
For this study, we selected VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN to extract the 
features from panda facial images. 

2.2.2. ResNet

We  used  Pytorch  to  build  our  deep  neural  network,  which  was 
trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. In order to accelerate the convergence of 
the model, our model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Deng 
et  al., 2009) and then independently  fine-tuned on our  PAD Full and 
PAD Lite datasets. However, some individuals cross multiple age groups. 
Thus, to eliminate the influence of individuals, we applied a five-fold 
subject-exclusive  (SE)  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Pan  et  al.,  2018)  which 
ensured the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing 
set at the same time. We downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 
× 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting 
and imbalanced problem, we applied aggressive data augmentation. Our 
original images were captured under different illumination and angles. 
Thus, we augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping,

L = (cid:0)

where yi, j is a soft label of the i-th sample (the ground truth age is j), and 
pi is vector of probability predicted from i-th sample based on Eq. (3).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The authors used a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) method to ensure that the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets simultaneously. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new data. Additionally, they mention applying aggressive data augmentation techniques to address potential issues related to overfitting and class imbalance. These techniques include random horizontal flipping of images during training. However, the specific proportions or percentages used for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
