mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

Input Data

In this paper, the input data are 40-dimensional data. Due to the large time span and large land
area in the training data, there are large diﬀerences in the distribution between diﬀerent batches of
training data in the training stage, and there is a certain distribution diﬀerence between the training set
and the test set. Therefore, batch normalization is performed on the input data, where the speciﬁc
calculation/transformation of BatchNorm (Algorithm 1) is shown below. First, the mean of each
channel in the current batch is calculated, and then, the variance of each channel in the current batch is
calculated. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation
to obtain the normalized output ˆχ
i is multiplied by the scale parameter γ, and the shift
parameter β is added to obtain the ﬁnal output yi:

i; then, ˆχ

Traditional means and algorithms lack the ability to quantitatively analyze the drivers and
mechanisms of LUCC, and the accumulation of massive data over the years provides the possibility of
using deep learning models for related explorations. The probability of the LU distribution can be
determined by a deep learning model. The LU probability cannot determine whether a certain LU
type exists at that time; its function is to determine the distribution probability of a variety of LU types
in a spatial unit, and the probability is the basis for the SM.

Figure 4 introduces the adopted DM. In the DM, the grid with the neighborhood features includes
the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, and all grid
units are input into the DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, ﬁt the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the
SM, and perform further LU simulations.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input data consists of 40-dimensional data, which suggests that the data could be in a structured format such as a CSV file or a similar tabular format. Additionally, the fact that the data undergoes batch normalization indicates that the data might be numerical in nature. It also states that the data contains various features like LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, which implies that the data is likely geospatial in nature. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the exact format of the input data, we cannot definitively confirm if it is in a specific format such as image, audio, video, or CSV.
