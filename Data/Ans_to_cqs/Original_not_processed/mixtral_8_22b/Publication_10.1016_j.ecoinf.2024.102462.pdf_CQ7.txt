In order to solve this problem, we used a DL approach. DL networks 
can be seen as non-linear functions with a large number of parameters. 
The parameters of each DL are adjusted using annotated data (usually 
referred  to  as  a  “supervised  approach”).  Once  this  process  (called 
training the network) is finished, the evaluation of the network on the real 
problem  is  performed  by  feeding  it  an  independent  data  set  not  seen 
during training (the testing data set). DL techniques are currently a hot 
topic in machine learning with applications in a variety of fields, and are 
considered the current state of the art for CV applications. In fact, in 
some disciplines, this technology is considered to have exceeded human 
capabilities (Buetti-Dinh et al., 2019; He et al., 2015).

the  experts.  Then  the  network  is  fed  this  annotated  data  and  the  pa-
rameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. 
Once this training process is finished, the model is ready to process new 
unseen  data.  DL  networks  are,  thus,  able  to  capture  statistics  and  re-
lationships directly from the data following human expertise. If the data 
used  for  training  the  model  is  representative  of  the  problem  and  the 
annotations are carefully generated, the resulting network can perform 
at a similar level with any input data set. This capacity to translate the 
training to other independent datasets is called the generalization power 
of the network. In practice, differences in performance between the re-
sults with the training data (or data that is similar to it, i.e., from the 
same  site  and  acquired  at  the  same  time)  and  those  of  independent 
datasets (often in research papers referred to as the testing data set) can

Finally, with the goal of assessing the generalization power of the 
networks  studied,  in  section  4.2.3  we  divided  the  data  into  4  non- 
overlapping  subsites  to  maximise  the  independence  between  the 
training and testing sets. Overall, the results (Section 4.2.3) were slightly 
lower  than  in  previous  experiments,  showcasing  how  the  common 
practice of randomly dividing a single data set into training and testing 
may  lead to overestimating practical performance. In all fairness, the 
conditions studied were probably unfavorable, as the high variation in 
class distribution between training and testing sets could have also been 
ameliorated by using data augmentation or building datasets that better 
reflect  real  percentages.  Having  said  that,  DL  networks  still  obtained 
results  clearly  beyond  those  of  human  observers  with  a  71.76% 
weighted  accuracy.  This  indicates  that  DL  networks  can  be  used  as

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide some insights into the splitting process. For instance, it mentions that the data was divided into four non-overlapping subsites to maximize the independence between the training and testing sets. This suggests that one criterion used might be ensuring that the training and testing data come from different sources or locations to ensure the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Additionally, the text implies that the division should avoid overlaps between the training and testing sets to prevent the model from simply memorizing the training data instead of learning meaningful patterns. Lastly, the text hints at the importance of considering the class distribution when splitting the data, as significant variations between the training and testing sets could negatively impact the model's performance.
