To  predict  the  distribution  of  the  study  species,  we  employed  an 
ensemble  modeling  approach  in  BIOMOD2  package  (Thuiller  et  al., 
2009) in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) (See text S1). With this 
approach,  we  weight  averaged  four  different  models,  including  one 
regression-based 
three 
machine-learning  (Maximun  entropy  (MaxEnt),  RF(Random  Forest), 
and  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM))  models,  to  generate  a  final 
ensembled model for each species. To test for model performance, we 
employed cross-validationby using 70% of the dataset as training data to 
build  the  models  and  the  other  30%  as  testing  data  to  calculate  the 
models’  accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Character-
istics Curve is the index we used to specify the accuracy (AUC). AUC is a 
scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates that the 
model  is  more  accurate  (Phillips  and  Dudík,  2008).  We  considered  a

3.1. Model accuracy

To model habitat suitability for each species, we collected a priori a 
suite of raster layers representing potentially essential variables based 
on species ecology (Shahnaseri et al., 2019; Yusefi et al., 2021a, 2021b; 
Rezaei et al., 2022a, 2022b). These variables include seven bioclimatic 
variables  from  the  WORLDCLIM  database,  30  arc-seconds  (Fick  and 
Hijmans, 2017), Digital Elevation Model from the 90-m Shuttle Radar 
Topography  Mission  (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov),  and  distance-to- 
rivers  (DR),  distance-to-streams  (DS),  distance-to-roads  (DRO)  and 
distance-to-human settlements (DH)  from Iranian  Forests, Range,  and 
Watershed Management Organization (IFRWMO, 2014). The distance-to 
variables were calculated with the Euclidean distance tool in the Spatial 
Analyst extension in ArcGIS v10.2. We used a map of the network of 
protected areas developed by the DoE (https://www.doe.ir/) to evaluate

Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but the given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or the datasets used within them. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query based solely on the provided context. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is grayscale and has been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

CIFAR is a dataset containing 60,000 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are two versions of the dataset: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 contains 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 contains 600 images per class.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing over 14 million labeled images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories. It was created for use in visual object recognition software research.

Again, without additional context, it cannot be determined which, if any, of these datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
