6.1. Vision transformer 

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is a deep neural network 
first created for natural language processing (NLP), was built on a self- 
attention mechanism that makes it possible for noticeably huge recep-
tive  fields.  The Transformer  has become  a  de facto industry  standard 
procedure in NLP because of its remarkable efficiency, and it has also 
motivated  researchers  in  the  field  of  computer  vision  to  investigate 
applications  by  utilizing  the  long-term  relationships  between  pixels 
(Khan et al., 2022).

learning and L2 regularization. Under this perspective, in this work, two 
types  of  data  were  only  used,  whereas  some  restrictions  arise  on  its 
potential application to additional datasets.

nism (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). In contrast to CNN, ViT's Self Attention 
was  able  to  combine  the  data  from  the  entire  image,  and  accurately 
model  lengthy  sequence  information.  In  the  standard  ViT  model,  the 
relationship between distinct tokens was crucial since all images were 
turned into fixed-size tokens. By reusing the relationship matrix of the 
image  features,  the  lower  level  ViT  can  perform  more  accurate  rela-
tionship modelling. The images were converted into tokens in a process 
that  is  equivalent  to  downsampling.  A  larger  downsampling  multiple 
indicates that fewer tokens are obtained and more information is lost. 
When  more  tokens  are  acquired  and  the  downsampling  multiple  is 
lower, the lost information is less. When converting a picture to a token, 
the image's content is not taken into account. Such downsampling is too 
fine-grained for complicated pictures, which results in a loss of accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on the general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, these are common data annotation techniques used for various tasks.

Bounding Box Annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object in an image to identify its location. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

Instance Segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a unique identifier to distinguish individual instances of objects. This technique is often used in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and satellite imagery analysis.

Other data annotation techniques include Semantic Segmentation, Polygon Annotation, Landmark Annotation, and Keypoint Annotation. These techniques are used depending on the specific requirements of the task and the type of data being analyzed.
