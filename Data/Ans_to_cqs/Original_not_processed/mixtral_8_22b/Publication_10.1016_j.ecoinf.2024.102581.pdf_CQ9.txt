6.1.2. CVIP100 dataset 

The  CVIP100  dataset  is  a  valuable  and  widely  used  resource  for 
computer vision-related tasks and digital image processing. This dataset 
comprises 100 species and a total of 1208 high-quality plant leaf images, 
which are carefully curated to accumulate a wide range of scenes, ob-
jects,  and  visual  complexities.  Using  augmentation,  the  size  of  the 
dataset is increased to 3000 images with 30 images per class to balance 
the  dataset.  Each  image  in  the  CVIP100  dataset  is  annotated  with 
ground-truth information, providing researchers with a reliable bench-
mark for evaluating the performance of various computer vision algo-
rithms and techniques.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide specific information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the CVIP100 dataset was used, which comprises 100 species and a total of 1208 high-quality plant leaf images. However, it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded from. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
