extending  the  possibility  for  a  wide  coverage.  The  improvements  in 
Explainable  Artificial  Intelligence  techniques  can  make  it  easy  to  un-
derstand and interpret the deep learning models' predictions, and also to 
evaluate  and  improve  the  models.  The  large-scale  inferences  from  a 
study could see an interplay between the low power edge devices and 
virtually unlimited storage and compute resources with cloud technol-
ogies. By incorporating the processing on the camera trap, it is possible 
to obtain timely information from large scale ecological studies, even at 
the global scale. With further improvements in the battery technologies, 
deep learning model optimizations, and better hardware, it would soon 
become easier and common for ecological studies to utilize customized 
camera  trap  devices  with  on-board  classification,  visualization,  and 
communications.

Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) are based on an 
alternative attention-based model design rather than CNN. The trans-
former  architecture was first applied on Natural Language Processing 
(NLP)  problems.  The  recent  ground-breaking  research  outputs  of 
Generative  Pre-trained  Transformer  (GPT)  and  Bidirectional  Encoder 
Representations from Transformers (BERT) are all based on the trans-
former architecture. The concepts of attention were later applied to the 
image classification problems as Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 
2021). The transformers use the relationship between words, termed as 
attention, whereas the vision transformers determine relationships be-
tween patches of images. ViT have since achieved performance similar 
to convolution-based architectures. There are many vision transformer 
architectures for image classification but we chose MobileViT (Mehta 
and Rastegari, 2022) models proposed as a small model for embedded

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications about potential sources of data. For instance, the phrase "large scale ecological studies" suggests that data might be collected through fieldwork or observations in natural environments. Additionally, the reference to "camera traps" implies that these devices could be employed to gather visual data automatically. Furthermore, the paper by Shahinfar et al. (2020) discusses the impact of sample size on deep learning model performance, which may indicate that they used a dataset composed of multiple images. Lastly, the study by Simões et al. (2023) focuses on wildlife identification and localization using deep learning on camera trap videos, suggesting that video footage could serve as another source of data. Therefore, while the exact methods for gathering raw data are not specified, it appears that various approaches such as fieldwork, camera traps, and publicly available datasets could potentially be utilized in this context.
