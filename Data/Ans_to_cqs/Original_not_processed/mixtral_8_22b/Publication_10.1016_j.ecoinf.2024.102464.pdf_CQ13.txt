In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

extinction rate of 1 if they are smaller than u1/x. The survival rate of the 
species, represented by parameter x, depends on the patch size (Graham 
et al., 2018; Risk et al., 2011).

a  landscape.  A  minimum  of  10  occupied  patches  in  the  study  area  is 
required to achieve accurate parameterization (Hanski et al., 2000). The 
method proposed in this study can overcome the limitations of the IFM 
model  because  it  analyzes  the  species  distribution  model  results, 
focusing on species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters such as L1 or L2 regularization coefficients. These hyperparameters need to be tuned based on the problem and dataset being considered. In general, the learning rate controls how much the weights are updated during backpropagation, the optimizer determines the optimization algorithm used for updating the weights, the batch size specifies the number of samples processed before the model updates its internal parameters, the number of epochs defines the total number of iterations through the entire dataset, and regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding penalties to the loss function. Without further details about the specific deep learning model used in the study, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameters were used and what their respective values were.
