hyperparameters  (i.e.,  ‘AutoML’;  He  et  al.,  2021).  This  represents  an 
important  advantage  for  non-experts  in  deep  learning,  as  it  does  not 
require  the  manual  assembly  of  the  models  and  definition  of  their 
hyperparameters. The AutoML procedure starts by generating a set of 
candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters (e.g. number 
of layers; learning rate) selected at random from a prespecified range of 
values (see Fig. 2). Each candidate model is trained using a small subset 
of the data (data partition At; Fig. 2) during a small number of epochs. 
After  training,  the  performance  of  the  candidate  models  is  compared 
using a left-out validation data set (Av; Fig. 2). The selected candidate 
model (usually the best performing among candidates) is then trained on 
the full training data (Bt; Fig. 2). In this step it is required to identify an 
optimal number of training epochs, to avoid under- or overfitting of the

information  fed  to  the  input  layer.  For  more  details  on  ANNs  with 
emphasis on ecology see, Lek and Gu´egan (1999), Olden et al. (2008) 
and Christin et al. (2019).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge, these are some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Image Classification: Labeling images into categories or classes.
2. Object Detection: Identifying objects within an image and drawing bounding boxes around them.
3. Semantic Segmentation: Assigning each pixel in an image to a class label.
4. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but different instances of the same object get separate labels.
5. Key Point Detection: Locating key points or landmarks on an object.
6. Text Annotation: Tagging text data with relevant metadata like sentiment, intent, etc.

These techniques help train machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
