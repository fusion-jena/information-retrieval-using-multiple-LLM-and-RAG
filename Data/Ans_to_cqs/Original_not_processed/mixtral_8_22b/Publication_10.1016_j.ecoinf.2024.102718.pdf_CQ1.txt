individual extraction of features. Such techniques acquire characteris-
tics directly from the unprocessed data,
improving accuracy and
robustness (Archana and Jeevaraj, 2024; Mumuni and Mumuni, 2024;
Yang et al., 2023a). In addition, deep learning effectively manages
extensive datasets, enhancing the ability to apply knowledge across
many scenarios in agricultural settings.

Additionally, S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. proposed the CAHA-
AXRNet approach, a novel rice plant disease detection method opti-
mizing hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hum-
mingbird algorithm. This approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.1%
when evaluating three types of disease detection datasets, namely the
rice plant dataset, rice leaf dataset, and rice disease dataset (Sankar-
eshwaran et al., 2023). M. Sharma et al. introduced a novel structure
called DeepBatch, which utilized deep learning-based segmentation
with bitwise logical and operation to diagnose rice-infected leaves. This
approach demonstrated a substantial enhancement in performance
when compared to traditional methods, particularly in the identification
of rice diseases (Sharma et al., 2023b).

H. Yang et al. proposed the dense higher-level composition detection
transformer (DHLC-DETR) specifically for identifying rice diseases. The

3.1. Data acquisition

To completely validate the network presented in this study, two
types of public datasets are being utilized. The first is the Plant Village
(Hughes and Salathe, 2016) dataset, which is used to pre-train the net-
workâ€™s weights. The second is the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset (Hossain,
2023), which is applied to train the final model for diagnosing rice leaf
diseases in the field.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of two types of public datasets for validating the network: the Plant Village dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset. These datasets are likely collected using various methods such as image capturing or sensor readings, but the exact collection process is not detailed in the given context. Therefore, based on the available information, we can only infer that public datasets are one source of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.
