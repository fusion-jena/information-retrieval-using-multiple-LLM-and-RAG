Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in their deep learning pipeline. However, based on the listed variables such as current speed, temperature, sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, bottom temperature, net primary production, dissolved molecular oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll fronts, SST fronts, thermocline intensity, thermocline depth, temperature gradient, bathymetry, latitude, longitude, month, and various numerical values, it can be inferred that the authors likely utilized structured data formats like CSV or similar tabular formats. These types of data formats are commonly used when working with environmental and geospatial datasets. The machine learning algorithms mentioned in the paper include Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is typically applied to structured data rather than unstructured data like images, audio, or video. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the researchers primarily employed structured data formats in their deep learning pipeline.
