The model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network (Tan and 
Le, 2019) which had been trained for generic image classification. The 
EfficientNet feature extraction layers are frozen (transfer learning) with 
only the weights of the final dense classification layers updated during 
training.  Training  was  conducted  within  the  Google  Collaboratory 
‘Colab’  platform  (Bisong,  2019),  using  the  Tesla  K80  GPU,  accessed 
through  cloud  computing.  An  Adam  optimizer  was  used  to  control 
gradient descent during training (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with parame-
ters set to: learning rate of 0.001, decay factor of 0.75 and a step size of

way  ML  allows  the  automation  of  tasks  previously  considered  as 
requiring  manual  processing  (Stowell,  2022).  For  instance,  marine 
mammal  calls  have  been  classified  with  a  wealth  of  ML  algorithms 
including  support  vector  machines  (Jarvis  et  al.,  2008;  Roch  et  al., 
2008), generalised linear models, hidden Markov models (Brown et al., 
2010;  Pace  et  al.,  2012;  Roch  et  al.,  2011)  and  classification  and 
regression tree analysis (Oswald et al., 2003). These advances have led 
to a rise in the number of published trained CNN models available for 
researchers  to  download  and  use  as  tools.  The  performance  of  these 
CNNs has been found to rival human performance at signal recognition 
(LeCun et al., 2015). CNNs can learn to discriminate spectro-temporal 
information  directly  from  a  labelled  spectrogram,  used  as  an  image 
input. The success of CNNs within the marine bioacoustic field has been

limited re-training. Starting with a pre-trained model (EfficientNet B0, 
Tan and Le, 2019), we freeze the networks original feature extractor. We 
then train fully connected layers, which operate on the output of the 
EfficientNet  B0  network,  to  classify  the  PAM  data  frames  into  the 
specified sound source classes. Audio data is input to the network in a 
novel  spectrogram representation (White  et  al.,  2022). Networks  pre- 
trained on image data have been proven to perform well on classifica-
tion  tasks  using  spectrograms  as  image  input,  transformed  from  raw 
audio data (Allen et al., 2021; Shiu et al., 2020; Stowell, 2022). In this 
work  we fine-tune the  parameters  of the fully connected layers  itera-
tively  on  small  batches  of  training  data  acquired  from  a  new  region.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is based on the EfficientNet B0 network, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Tan and Le (2019). This network was originally trained for generic image classification but was adapted for the specific task of classifying Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data frames into specified sound source classes. The EfficientNet B0 network uses transfer learning, where the feature extraction layers are frozen, and only the weights of the final dense classification layers are updated during training. The audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation, and the networks pre-trained on image data have been shown to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input.
