Various parameter values, including learning rate (i.e., 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1), batch size (i.e., 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512), and latent
dimension (i.e., 128, 256, 512, 2048), have been explored and
evaluated.

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

et al., 2023), which has input data sizes similar to ours while handling an
imbalanced dataset.

5.2.1. Results: Trajectory reconstruction

While it is true that our diffusion and autoencoder models do not
know which sample belongs to which class, there may be some classes
that are implicitly simpler to reconstruct. Additionally, a model could be
learning those samples belonging to the most popular classes more
effectively. Consequently, we also conduct an analysis of the trajectory
reconstruction error for the proposed diffusion model and the proposed
autoencoder. This involves assessing the networks' loss (in terms of MSE)
and comparing the reconstructed data with the original data to measure
their similarity.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other deployment platform.
