C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.

Our proof-of-principle example demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
comprehensive  processing  pipeline  in  mitigating  device  biases  in  site 
comparisons  using  ecoacoustic  indices  (EAI).  Although  EAIs  are  not 
typically  used  for  site  comparisons  due  to  contradictory  correlations 
with biological variables across different study sites (Bradfer-Lawrence 
et  al.,  2019a),  our  methodology  addresses  one  of  the  previously  un-
considered sources of variability that could explain these contradictions, 
such  as  differences  between  recording  devices.  By  eliminating  device 
bias, we expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine 
learning  and  deep  learning,  which  require  consistent  feature  spaces 
regardless of the recording device used.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer on where it might be located, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out more about its location, additional resources would need to be consulted.
