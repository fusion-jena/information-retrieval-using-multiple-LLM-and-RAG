scientific learning having no proper access to graphing parts of articles 
and/or books (Albany-Ward and Sobande, 2015).

different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

Colour gamut is of primary importance to synthesise the information 
contained in a dataset/map. Summarising, there are three main impor-
tant elements/steps when applying a colour gamut to data rendering: (i) 
the possibility of using different colour palettes in a software, (ii) the 
choice made by the map producer about one of the possible palettes, and 
(iii) how such a choice is perceived by users. From this point of view, 
awareness  of  the  uncertainty  and  potential  limitations  of  the  use  of 
colours in maps may enhance map interpretation and use. While colour- 
coding guidelines are needed, we are far from having an etiquette on this

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the class balance in the dataset. In oversampling, samples from the minority class are duplicated to match the number of samples in the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. These techniques help improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets.

Finally, diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset represents all relevant scenarios. This helps reduce bias and improves the robustness of the model.
