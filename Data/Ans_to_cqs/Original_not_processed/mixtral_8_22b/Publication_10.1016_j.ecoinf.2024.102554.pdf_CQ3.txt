Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

other pivotal operations. For those who seek to delve deeper into the 
operational intricacies of these tools, the repositoryâ€™s README.md file 
serves as a valuable resource.

In the pursuit of enhancing our comprehension of aquatic systems, 
the SMARTLAGOON project has been a pivotal initiative. Through this 
project,  an  innovative  satellite  data  collection  tool  was  developed, 
which systematically collects water quality data from public Application 
Programming  Interfaces  (APIs)  of  major  space  agencies  including  the 
European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration  (NASA).  This  tool  is  engineered  to  meet  the  needs  of 
users and third-party applications, providing historical and current data 
insights,  thus  constructing  an  organized  and  coherent  time  series  of 
varied  variables  obtained  by  Satellite  Remote  Sensing  (SRS)  services. 
The  architecture  of  this  sophisticated  tool  is  divided  into  two  core 
components as shown in Fig. 2. The first component focuses on acquiring 
satellite  imagery  for  predefined  geospatial  coordinates  over  a  deter-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can infer some details about the type of data being collected and processed.

The text mentions a crawling tool developed to gather historical and near real-time data from different SRS products. These data include vital parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The data sources mentioned are the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The project also involves collecting water quality data from public APIs of major space agencies using an innovative satellite data collection tool. This tool provides historical and current data insights, creating an organized and coherent time series of varied variables obtained by Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) services.

One of the key components of this tool focuses on acquiring satellite imagery for predefined geospatial coordinates. The text specifically mentions the use of the spectrometer Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 300m.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this project, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data annotation techniques employed.
