Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

the inability to split further, is met. This algorithm is simple, fast, and 
highly interpretable (Gislason et al., 2006). It is important to note that 
CART models can be susceptible to overfitting without proper tuning of 
input  parameters.  In  this  research,  by  evaluating  the  model's  perfor-
mance  using  validation  data,  it  was  determined  that  setting  the  Max

5.4.3. Performance evaluation 

For  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  generated  LULC  map  in 
simulating meteorological parameters, statistical metrics such as Root 

Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Bias were 
defined below:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the model were not optimized using methods like grid search or random search due to processing limitations in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Instead, they utilized validation data for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model to prevent overfitting. The specific hyperparameters set for each model during training and validation are presented in Table 3. However, the exact methodology used for selecting these hyperparameters is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
