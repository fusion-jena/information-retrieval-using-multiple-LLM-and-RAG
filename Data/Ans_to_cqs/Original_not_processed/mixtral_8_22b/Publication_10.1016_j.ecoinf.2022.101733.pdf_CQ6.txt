according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

method has its own pros and cons. The ability to collect large numbers of 
samples  in  a  very  short  time  is  one  of  the  major  advantages  of  this 
method. On the other hand, as its cons, we can mention that a few points 
may be collected incorrectly, and the human expert corrects them in the 
post-supervision step.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that after collecting samples, they were checked carefully, and no mis-collected samples were found. This implies some form of data cleaning was performed. Additionally, the use of a 60%-40% ratio for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets suggests that the data might have been shuffled and split, which could also be considered part of the preprocessing stage. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed if these steps were taken specifically for preparing the data for a deep learning model.
