grating  advanced  techniques  such  as  a  deep  learning  CNN,  LSTM 
network, crawler search algorithm (RSA), and vector-weighted average 
optimizer  (INFO),  with  an  RMSE  of  1.079  and  a  MAE  of  0.0839.  Di 
Nunno  et  al.  (2023)  introduced  a  novel  machine  learning  algorithm, 
combining a multi-layer perceptron with a random forest (MLP-RF), that 
predicts lake surface water temperatures using daily air temperature as 
an external input variable. By utilizing this method through Bayesian 
optimization, they achieved an R2  of 0.932, an RMSE of 0.77, and an 
MAE of 0.55 over a prediction duration of 7 days. Liang et al. (2023) 
used 4D spatiotemporal features for DO prediction in coastal waters with 
a machine learning approach, achieving an MAE of 0.571 and an R2  of 
0.795.

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

4.3. Case 1: DO prediction in the Shandong peninsula

Given  this  context,  many  researchers  have  turned  to  machine 
learning  algorithms  for  modeling  DO  to  capture  its  nonlinear  charac-
teristics  and  enable  dynamic  adjustments  Jasmin  et  al.  (2022).  For 
example,  machine  learning  algorithms  such  as  random  forests  and 
adaptive  boosting  have  been  used  for  water  quality  prediction, 
providing timely warnings Chen et al. (2020). A study by Searcy and 
Boehm  (2021)  demonstrated  that  random  forest  algorithms  could 
effectively predict water quality data collected hourly over 24 to 48 h, 
supporting  public  health  decisions.  Additionally,  Deng  et  al.  (2021) 
proposed a model based on artificial neural networks and support vector 
machines for the early warning of harmful algal blooms, thus improving 
coastal water environment management. In another study, Azma et al. 
(2023) evaluated water quality data using atomic search optimization

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, it mentions some strategies related to managing variability and uncertainty in the models. One such strategy is the use of Bayesian optimization in Di Nunno et al.'s (2023) work, which can help tune hyperparameters and improve model performance. Another strategy mentioned is the implementation of an early stopping mechanism during training, which prevents overfitting issues and ensures convergence before reaching the final epoch. Furthermore, the text discusses dividing datasets into training, validation, and testing sets, with a chronological division to better represent real-world scenarios and enhance the model's generalizability. Although these strategies do not directly address handling randomness in the form of random seed values, they contribute to managing variability and uncertainty within the deep learning pipeline.
