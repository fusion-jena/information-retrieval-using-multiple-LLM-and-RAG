In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their work publicly through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I recommend searching these platforms with keywords related to the topic, such as "deep learning," "long short-term memory" (LSTM), "dissolved oxygen," and the authors' names mentioned in the given references. This should help find relevant repositories containing the desired code pipelines.

If no direct links are found, consider reaching out to the authors via email or other contact details provided in their publications. They may be able to share their code privately or guide you towards any existing public repositories.
