Fig.  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  tool,  highlighting  its  various 
features, which are identified by corresponding numbers in the figure. 
These  features  include  1)  zoom  in  and  out,  default  extent,  and  my 
location;  2)  search  bar  to  find  a  place  or  address;  3)  environmental 
justice indices alongside total pollutant loads before and after BMP; 4) 
map legend; 5); filtering metrics based on specific values; 6) addition of 
online  data;  7)  selection  of  different  basemaps;  and  8)  selection  of  a 
specific region, print map and share the tool. Using the drop-down menu 
labeled as #3 in Fig. 6, users can access pollutant loads pre- and post- 
BMP  implementation,  as  well  as  EJ  metrics  and  indices.  All  data  are 
color-coded based on quantile mapping, which means there are equal 
numbers of watersheds or census tracts within each class, representing 
different  tiers  of  pollution  or  social  vulnerability.  Pollutant  loads  are

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to your query. Please provide more relevant context so I can assist you better.

Answer:::

Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. This is because the provided text does not mention anything related to a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. It primarily discusses a decision support tool for equitable nutrient reduction, focusing on features like zoom in/out, search bar, environmental justice indices, pollutant loads, and other functionalities. To accurately answer your query, additional context regarding the deep learning model would be required.
