4.3.1. Data description

This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

rate of 0.05 is implemented. Throughout the training process, a learning 
rate of 0.0001 is used, with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances 
processed  per  batch.  To  prevent  data  snooping  bias,  the  dataset  is 
divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation 
set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy better simulates 
real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test 
sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generaliz-
ability of the model. All the tests are run on a Windows 11 operating 
system  using  Python  3.8,  with  specific  hardware,  including  a  laptop 
possessing a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. Due to the early stopping strategy, the 
training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting 
issues.

During  training,  the  input  tensor  comprises  three  dimensions:  the 
batch  size,  the  number  of  model  variables,  and  the  future  prediction 
length. The dimension concerning the number of features is segmented 
by dynamically changing the slice sizes and strides, and the segmented 
tensors are folded, adding a slice dimension. Finally, by merging the first 

In the second stage of the attention calculation, the covariates are 
dynamically segmented, capturing their features at different time scales 
through multiscale attention. Specifically, for the static variables S(t),

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset is divided chronologically into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. It also states that the dataset is used for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the Shandong Peninsula. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset likely contains historical marine chemical data relevant to DO concentrations in the region. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot determine if any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular study.
