With regards to the difference between the results of the original, 
reduced,  and  augmented  datasets  applied  to  the  deep  learning 
model, we found that the original and augmented datasets are only 
under  a  few  specific  numbers  of  bands  and  data  formats  (e.g., 
VGG19 + 8band_256_8bit, VGG19 + 72band_256_8bit, ResNet50 +
8band_256_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band_ 256_8bit). The classifica-
tion accuracy rate reached more than 50%, and there was no regu-
larity in the classification accuracy. However, the sampling action of 
reducing the data had a very obvious and consistent impact on the 
classification  accuracy,  especially  in  the  VGG19  model,  which  is 
more  similar  to  the  traditional  CNN  model.  This  representative 
sampling  action  resulted  in  incomplete  and  complete  feature 
extraction,  and  some  key  features  were  ignored.  Given  the  above 
reasons, it is recommended that sampling actions be avoided in the

after the above training data preparation is as follows (Fig. 6). One of the 
optimal  simulation  results  (72band_256_16bit_split)  was  achieved 
through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution 
kernels, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

When  the  image  units  of  bands  36  and  72  are  input  to  the  deep 
learning model, the memory capacity may be insufficient given the large 
dimensions. Therefore, when inputting sample images for bands 36 and 
72, we used Python's Rasterio module to disassemble them into single- 
band  images,  i.e.,  the  image  units  with  36  bands  were  disassembled 
into 36 single-band images and 72-band images were disassembled into 
72  single-band  images.  This  data  conversion  method  is  equivalent  to 
flattening the thick convolution kernel. During testing, we found that 
through  the  optimization  of  this  process,  the  hardware resources  and 
computing time required for deep learning can be considerably reduced, 
while the corresponding impact on the model's accuracy is limited. 

3.2. Deep learning model and testing results 

After selecting the model, the CNN model in this study was further 

built using the following steps:

as high-level semantics, which is essential for tasks such as image clas-
sification,  object  detection,  and  segmentation.  The  flexibility  of  deep 
learning  models,  particularly  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs), 
allows customization across diverse image tasks, from classification to 
style  transfer.  Deep  learning  has  consistently  delivered  unparalleled 
performance,  with  models  such  as  ResNet  and  Faster  R-CNN  setting 
benchmarks in their respective fields. The scalability of these models, 
contingent on available data and computational power, is particularly 
valuable for extensive image datasets. Transfer learning offers a critical 
advantage; models pre-trained on vast datasets, such as ImageNet, can 
be repurposed, enhancing their performance on tasks with limited data. 
Many current studies have proven the ability and effectiveness of CNN to 
distinguish specific tree species in forests using RGB images or hyper-

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the text focuses on discussing the differences in results obtained by applying various datasets (original, reduced, and augmented) to different deep learning models (VGG19 and ResNet50). It also mentions the use of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels to achieve optimal simulation results. Furthermore, the context discusses handling large dimensions of input images by disassembling them into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module. In summary, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
