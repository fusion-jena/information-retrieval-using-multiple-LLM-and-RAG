different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

Fig. 1. Light rays coming from outside hit the cornea of the human eye, they pass through the lens and the vitreous humor and focus on the retina, which is a nerve 
structure. Here the translation of the light into electric signal takes place. This electrical impulse travels along the visual pathways to the occipital cortex where it is 
converted  into  a  visual  image.  There  are  different  manners  to  perceive  colours,  once  the  human  eye  is  exposed  to  external  light  rays:  (a)  standard  vision;  (b) 
protanopia, i.e., the inability to perceive the red colour (560 nm); (c) deuteranopia, i.e., the inability to recognize the green colour (530 nm); (d) tritanopia, i.e., the 
inability to distinguish the blue colour (420 nm). Refer to Box 1 for specific information.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as creating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or generating confusion matrices. However, these are common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning applications.

After training a model, some typical postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the given dataset.

2. Validation: Perform cross-validation or other validation methods to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and testing the model on each fold while training on the remaining ones.

3. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc., to improve the model's performance. Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be employed for this purpose.

4. Creating saliency maps: Generate saliency maps to understand what parts of the input data contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. This helps identify important features and provides insights into the decision-making process of the model.

5. Generating confusion matrices: Create confusion matrices to analyze the misclassifications made by the model. Confusion matrices provide a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping diagnose potential issues with the model.
