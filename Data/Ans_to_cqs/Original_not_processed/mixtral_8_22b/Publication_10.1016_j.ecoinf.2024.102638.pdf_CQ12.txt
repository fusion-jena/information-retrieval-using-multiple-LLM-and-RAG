XGB  optimises  predictive  modelling  through  gradient  boosting  and 
regularisation (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). SVR uses kernel functions to 
efficiently handle non-linear data by fitting the best hyperplane within a 
pre-defined  error  margin  (Hsu  et  al.,  2003).  MLP  is  a  feed-forward 
neural network that learns complex patterns using adjustable weights 
and activation functions (Kingma and Ba, 2014).

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in their pipeline. Instead, they focus on traditional machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Therefore, it can be concluded that no particular deep learning model was employed in this study.
