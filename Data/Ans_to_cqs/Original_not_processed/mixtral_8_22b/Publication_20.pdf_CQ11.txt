A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

of 16 images to train our network. We ran this architecture on Caﬀe (Jia
et al., 2014). To focus on the impact of the training data, we used the
same CNN architecture for our training and test procedures.

2.3. Building the training datasets

Using the raw training dataset of 20 ﬁsh species (Table S1) we built
4 diﬀerent datasets to assess the inﬂuence of the dataset building on
classiﬁcation results (Table S2).

The ﬁrst training dataset T1 contained raw ﬁsh thumbnails (T0) and

their respective mirror images.

More precisely, we doubled the number of thumbnails per ﬁsh in-
dividual by ﬂipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis.
Such a procedure homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and
right-oriented individuals in the database and we hypothesize it could
improve the average identiﬁcation rate since ﬁsh individuals are seen in
all positions.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text. However, based on the context provided, it can be assumed that the authors have shared their work in some form of open access repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to contact the authors directly or check any related publications for more specific information regarding the data repository link.
