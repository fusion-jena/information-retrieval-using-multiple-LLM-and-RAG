Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed, such as randomly splitting the dataset into three parts: training set (typically around 60-80% of the total data), validation set (around 10-20%), and testing set (around 10-20%) [1]. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model.
