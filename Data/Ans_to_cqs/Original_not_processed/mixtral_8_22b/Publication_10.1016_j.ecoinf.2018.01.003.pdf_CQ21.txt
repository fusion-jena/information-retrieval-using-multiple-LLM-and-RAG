a backward error correction stage. During the multilayer feedforward
process, the actual input and output of each layer of nodes are calcu-
lated starting from the input layer (Mao et al., 2009). The main
mathematical model is described as follows:

Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that since the models mentioned in the context are primarily used for prediction purposes, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of these models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, depending upon the application domain, other postprocessing techniques might also be employed. For instance, if the model is being used for image classification tasks, then generating class activation maps or saliency maps would help visualize which parts of the images were most influential in making predictions. Similarly, if the task involves multi-class classification problems, creating a confusion matrix would provide insights into how well the model is able to distinguish between different classes.
