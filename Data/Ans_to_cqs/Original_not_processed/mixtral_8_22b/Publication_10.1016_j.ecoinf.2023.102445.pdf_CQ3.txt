enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

input into the model network for training.

Y(i, j, c_out) represents the calculation result at position (i, j), the 
output channel c_out in the output feature map, X is the input image, the 
size of H_in × W_in × c_in, Y is the output image, and the size of H_out ×
W_out × c_out. Conv2d is a 2D convolution operation performed based 
on  the  input  X,  output  Y,  kernel  k,  step  size  s,  and  group  setting. 
BatchNorm2d  represents  the  batch  normalization  operation,  which  is 
used to normalize the convolution output and improve training stability. 
Then, the chunk is partitioned vertically and divided into two parts 
along the channel dimension. For the two branches, the size obtained is

H × W × C/2. First, Conv is applied to halve the number of channels, the 
feature size becomes H × W × C/4, and the calculation formulas are 
shown in Formula (3) and Formula (4). 

cv11(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

cv21(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of 
pest  detection  and  counting  research  using  deep  learning.  However, 
further exploration is still needed. Jinhui She et al. introduced the ECA 
attention mechanism into the YOLOv5s model to improve the precision 
of trap bottle detection and counting (She et al., 2022). However, there 
was  still room for further reduction in the size of the model. In their 
comparison of the effects of different deep learning methods on insect 
counting tasks, Ioannis Saradopoulos et al. concluded that YOLOv7/8 
generally  provided  the  best-embedded  solution  (Saradopoulos  et  al., 
2023). These findings serve as a reference for selecting the basic model 
in this paper. Tiewei Wang et al. proposed an improved recognition and 
counting approach based on deep learning with data reorganization and 
high detection and counting accuracy (Wang et al., 2022); however, the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation but also distinguishes individual instances of objects belonging to the same class. Polygon annotation involves creating polygonal shapes around objects of interest within images or videos. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects of interest within images or videos. Landmark annotation involves identifying specific facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. These annotations help train machine learning models to recognize patterns and make predictions accurately.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the authors have likely used some form of data annotation technique to train their deep learning models for pest detection and counting research. However, without explicit mention of the specific technique used, we cannot definitively state what type of annotation was employed.
