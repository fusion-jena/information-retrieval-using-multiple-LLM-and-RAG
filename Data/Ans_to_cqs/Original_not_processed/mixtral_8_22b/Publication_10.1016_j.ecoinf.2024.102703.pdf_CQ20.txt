Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

the neural network model. 

3. Results

Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

The BP neural network is among the most widely used neural net-
works. Due to its self-adaptability, self-organization, and fault tolerance, 
this  model  is  highly  effective  in  simulating  the  relationship  between 
spectral reflectance and water composition. It’s worth considering that 
aCDOM(254) still yielded a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.76) when predicting 
TSI, whereas Fn(355) still produced a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.71) when 
predicting TSI. We believe that the prediction results of the two models 
can be used as strong evidence for predicting TSI using DOM. This novel 
approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing 
DOM optical parameters, particularly the CDOM absorption coefficient, 
for  accurate  eutrophication  prediction.  It  was  also  mentioned  that 
aCDOM(254)  is  related  to  water  quality  parameters  such  as  DOC  and
