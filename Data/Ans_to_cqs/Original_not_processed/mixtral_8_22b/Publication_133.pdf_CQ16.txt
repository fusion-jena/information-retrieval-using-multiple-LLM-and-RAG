FIGURE 2 | The training process of the YOLOv5 model. The left panel depicts the loss function that drives the learning process. This function penalizes incorrect
predictions of the three focal species as well as missed ones. The learning consists of iterative reduction of this penalty for the training set images (blue) by a
stochastic gradient algorithm (Ruder, 2016). The validation set images (red) do not participate in the optimization and the gradual reduction in their loss indicates that
the training has not reached an overﬁtting point. The validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, suggesting that further training might lead to overﬁtting. Thus, the
deep learning model generated by 30 training epochs was used for tests. A different perspective on the gradually improving performance of the model is provided in
the right panel. The model’s average precision (AP) improves with the number of training epochs. The plot depicts the model’s mean AP (mAP) over the three insect
classes.

and to label them correctly. For the training and testing of the
method we used labeled images, which were divided to three
subsets: “training,” “validation,” and “test.” In the training phase
the algorithm uses the “training” and “validation” sets to create
a statistical model. In the test phase we apply the model to
the “test” set images, ignoring their labels. Each predicted label
is associated with a conﬁdence score that considers both the
probability that the label is correct, and the expected overlap
between the ground truth bounding box and the predicted one.
This overlap is expressed as the Intersection over union (IoU),
indicating the agreement between a predicted bounding box and
a ground truth box (Eq. 1).

the loss function, and modifying their parameters according
to the loss function’s gradient. Thus,
the loss declines in
each training round (aka epoch), and the model’s annotation
accuracy increases (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
As the number of parameters of a typical deep learning
model
is large, overﬁtting is a major concern. A common
(partial) remedy is the use of validation data, which are set-
aside while training, yet their annotations by the models are
the training
monitored. The validation data help to limit
duration, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. In this study
we used 30 epochs per training task, based on our validation
runs (Figure 2).

In our case, it is the proportion of expert-labeled “Glycaspis”
(respectively “Psyllaephagus” or “Thaumastocoris”) objects that
were also labeled “Glycaspis” (respectively “Psyllaephagus” or
“Thaumastocoris”) by the deep learning model. Recall is deﬁned
as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true
positives and false negatives. Precision (Eq. 3) is the fraction
of correctly classiﬁed objects among all classiﬁed objects. It is
deﬁned as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true
positives and false positives:

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The completion of training for the deep learning model in this study is determined by monitoring the validation loss during the training process. As shown in Figure 2, the validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, indicating that further training might lead to overfitting. Therefore, the deep learning model generated by 30 training epochs was used for tests. Additionally, the model's average precision (AP) over the three insect classes improves with the number of training epochs, providing another perspective on the gradually improving performance of the model.
