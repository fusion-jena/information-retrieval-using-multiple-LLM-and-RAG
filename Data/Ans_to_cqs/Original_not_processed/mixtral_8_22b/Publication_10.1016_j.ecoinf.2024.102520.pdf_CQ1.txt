2.3. Image acquisition and processing

A Phoenix receiver was utilized to determine sample locations in the 
middle of each square. At each location, three five-cm-diameter cores of 
15-cm length were taken, and then blended to obtain a representative 
sample of the soil at that site. A total of 300 representative soil samples

The Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m reso-
lution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), 
which  was accessed on April 21,  2023, were used in this study. Geo-
metric, radiometric and image mosaicking, and cropping are all aspects 
considered  in  the  remote  sensing  image  pre-processing.  The  slope, 
aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from 
DEM  were  calculated  using  the  System  for  Automated  Geoscientific 
Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital 
Number (Fortuna et al., 2022) provided the measured Surface Reflec-
tance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) 
helped to speed up data processing. The function ee. Image Collection in

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, it is mentioned that a Phoenix receiver was utilized to determine sample locations in the middle of each square. Three five-cm-diameter cores of 15-cm length were taken at each location, which were then blended to obtain a representative sample of the soil at that site. This suggests that one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through physical sampling of soil. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands of 30-m resolution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) for this study. This indicates that another method utilized for collecting raw data is through satellite imagery and remote sensing technology. However, there is no mention of any other specific methods such as surveys or public datasets being utilized in this particular study.
