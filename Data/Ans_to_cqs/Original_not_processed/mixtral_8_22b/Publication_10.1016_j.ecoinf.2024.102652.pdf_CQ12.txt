2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

once by adding the salinity indices, NDSI and NDVI in different com-
binations, as shown in Table 5. Then, the satellite images were split into 
70%  and  30%  for  training  and  testing,  respectively.  After  that,  the 
proposed  model  was  trained  and  tested  using  the  combination  image 
with the ground truth image. The presented model is a pixel-based deep 
learning segmentation architecture.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors are utilizing a custom deep learning model called MU-Net. However, without further details about the specific architecture or components of this model, we cannot definitively classify it as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model. Nevertheless, considering that the study focuses on soil salinity analysis using remote sensing imagery, it can be inferred that the MU-Net model likely incorporates elements commonly found in convolutional neural networks due to their effectiveness in processing image data.
