regularization parameter used to control model complexity and prevent 
overfitting  by  constraining  the  loss  function  during  training.  The 
parameter ε  controls the model's fault tolerance, that is, the degree of 
tolerance for differences between predicted and actual values of training 
samples. The term σ represents a parameter of a Gaussian kernel or the 
width parameter of a radial basis function kernel. This parameter con-
trols the relationship between support vectors and hyperplanes and af-
fects model complexity and generalization ability. SVR is formulated as

SVR is a machine learning method known for its superior accuracy 
compared  with  other  machine  learning  methods  and  its  ability  to 
simplify parameters, achieve global optimization, and handle nonlinear 
problems  (Chen  et  al., 2017;  Ji et  al.,  2021). In  this  study, the  expo-

(cid:0) 8–21 (Yang et al., 2022). Table 2 presents the training results for the

hyperparameter-optimized  SVR  model.  Parameter  C  controls  error 
tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that 
the model permits for any individual training example. A higher C value 
allows for a larger error, which makes the model more likely to fit the 
training  data  but  also  increases  the  risk  of  overfitting.  Conversely,  a 
smaller  C  value  imposes  stricter  constraints  on  the  model,  thereby 
increasing  the  difficultly  of  fitting  the  training  data  but  potentially

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics help assess the quality of the trained model and determine if further tuning or retraining is required.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the evaluation results, one might need to adjust the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for hyperparameter tuning.

3. Prediction/Inference: Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed for making predictions on unseen data. Depending upon the problem statement, these predictions could be binary classifications, multi-class classifications, or regressions.

4. Visualizations: To better understand the working of the model, visualizations like saliency maps, confusion matrices, decision boundaries, etc., can be generated. These visualizations provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and aid in interpreting the results.

5. Ensemble Methods: Sometimes, multiple models are combined to create an ensemble model to improve overall performance. Postprocessing steps would then involve combining the outputs of each model through various strategies like voting, averaging, stacking, etc.

6. Model Explanation: Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be applied to explain the decisions made by the model. This helps build trust in the model and provides transparency regarding its inner workings.

The exact postprocessing steps will depend on the specific use case and requirements. However, these are some commonly used steps that can enhance the utility and effectiveness of the trained model.
