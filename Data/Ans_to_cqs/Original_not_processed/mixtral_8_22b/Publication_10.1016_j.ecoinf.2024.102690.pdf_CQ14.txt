5. Discussion 

5.1. The multi-scenario setting helps construct spatially balanced ESPs

ecological leisure corridors, 6 along species migration corridors, and 2 
along  river  runoff  corridors  in  Scenario  C.  While  other  disturbance 
points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

4.4.3. Ecological barriers 

Based on the characteristics of each scenario, the search radius for 
ecological  barriers  was  set  as  follows.  A  search  radius  of  320  m  was 
established in Scenario A by computing the total area of cropland and 
the  accompanying  cropland  pressure  index  for  each  sub-district  in 
Guangzhou. Based on pertinent planning documents, the search radius 
was set to 200 m for Scenario B and 500 m for Scenario C. 

Six barriers were identified in Scenario A, where the land-use type 
was dominated by water bodies (Fig. 6c), mainly located in the south-

species inhabiting the PRD, was used as the reference. The maximum 
migration distance of this species was used to determine the maximum 
corridor  length,  whereas  the  wetland  resistance  value  was  used  to

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as using grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context.
