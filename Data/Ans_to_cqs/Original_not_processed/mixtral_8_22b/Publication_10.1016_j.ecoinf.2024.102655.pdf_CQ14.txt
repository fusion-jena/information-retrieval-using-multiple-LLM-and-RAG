%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based optimization. These techniques help find the best combination of hyperparameters for a particular machine learning model. Without more detailed information about the specific study or research paper referenced here, it is impossible to determine which method was employed for hyperparameter tuning.
