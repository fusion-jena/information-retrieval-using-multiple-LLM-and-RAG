The success plot is defined by the overlap of the bounding boxes. The 
success plot indicates the ratio of successful frames when the specific 
threshold  varies  from  zero  to  one  (Wu  et  al.,  2015).  The  higher  the 
success rate, the greater the degree of overlap between the bounding box 
and ground truth. The bounding box is marked as a, and the box ob-
tained by manual labeling is denoted as b. The overlap rate Soverlap can be 
defined as 

SOverlap =

|a ∩ b|
,
|a ∪ b|

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods such as grid search or random search. However, these are common techniques used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models. Grid search involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a certain range, while random search randomly selects values within the specified ranges. Other methods include Bayesian Optimization and Gradient-based Optimization. Without further details about the specific model and its implementation, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer.
