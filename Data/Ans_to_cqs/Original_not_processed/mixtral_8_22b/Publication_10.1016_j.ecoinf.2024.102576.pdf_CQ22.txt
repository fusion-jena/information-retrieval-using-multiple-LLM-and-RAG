the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

the  research conducted  by Kim et  al. (2021a).  Therefore, even in the 
absence of specific classes, using phenological characteristics, elements 
can still be classified on the basis of using classes that are most relevant. 
As  suggested  by  Kim  et  al.  (2021a),  the  classification  accuracy  and 
performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep 
learning  model  using  satellite  imageries  over  multiple  periods,  (Kim 
et al., 2021b). Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model 
can be used effectively. As a result, by employing PCF with DA, we could

address the limitations associated with the acquisition time of satellite 
imagery, resolution, and validation challenges encountered in previous 
studies, while harnessing the advantages of deep learning algorithms.

The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imagery over multiple periods. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to measure the performance of the deep learning model. Additionally, since the study mentions using the U-Net model, which is a type of CNN used for image segmentation tasks, other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or Intersection over Union (IoU) may also be used. These metrics are often employed when evaluating the performance of deep learning models in image segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the authors or further context, this remains speculative.
