Fig.  6. Model  retraining  results:  Accuracy,  precision  and  recall  of  models 
retrained  on  incremental  datasets  ranging  from  0  to  69  new  images.  Dashed 
lines show original model scores. Precision and recall are depicted vegetation 
(black  circles),  bare  (light  grey  squares)  and  other  (dark  grey  triangles). The 
size of the imagery dataset includes the training, validation and test images (e. 
g., size 10 includes 6 training, 2 validation and 2 test ground-truth images).

training, which helped to reduce human error. Similar to the seagrass 
semantic  segmentation  model,  the  resolution  of  the  images  in  the 
ground-truth dataset was reduced to 1000 × 1333, and the three colour 
channels of the images were normalised by subtracting the means and 
dividing  by  the  standard  deviations  per  channel.  The  colour  channel 
means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used 
in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50 (the used mean values 
were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 
0.224, 0.225]). The DETR model’s object queries parameter was set to 
100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image, which 
was sufficient for all case-study images.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific post-processing steps taken after the model training. However, we can infer some possible post-processing techniques based on common practices in machine learning projects. These may include generating saliency maps to visualize important features contributing to predictions, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance, or creating confusion matrices to understand misclassifications between classes. In this study, Fig. 6 shows the accuracy, precision, and recall of models retrained on incremental datasets, suggesting that these metrics might have been calculated during post-processing. Additionally, the mention of reducing human error through training implies that there could be manual verification or correction processes involved in post-processing.
