to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

As  the  dataset  in  this  study  is  self-defined  and  contains  only  one 
category,  challenges  arise  during  model  training,  including  concerns 
about  overfitting,  the  inability  to  assess  the  model’s  generalization 
ability,  and  uneven  data  distribution  affecting  prediction  rates.  To 
address these issues, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k- 
fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, whereas the 
remaining  four  subsets  constituted  the  training  set.  The  YOLOv7 
detection  model  underwent  five  rounds  of  training  and  validation  to 
assess  its  generalizability.  Fig.  10  depicts  the  accuracy  curve  graph 
resulting from the 5-fold cross-validation model. This reveals that the 
five  YOLOv7  models  optimally  used  all  the  samples  in  the  dataset, 
ensuring  that  each  sample  was  trained  and  validated  in  a  different 
subset. This approach yielded a prediction rate closer to 1. However, the

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken due to the unique nature of the self-defined dataset containing only one category. These measures aimed to address concerns such as overfitting, the inability to assess the model's generalization ability, and uneven data distribution affecting prediction rates.

Firstly, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, while the remaining four subsets formed the training set. This division allowed for multiple rounds of training and validation, ensuring that every sample was included in both processes but in different subsets. Specifically, the YOLOv7 detection model underwent five rounds of training and validation, which helped evaluate its generalizability.

This approach resulted in a prediction rate close to 1, indicating that the five YOLOv7 models utilized all the samples in the dataset efficiently. Moreover, the use of k-fold cross-validation ensured that each sample was trained and validated in a different subset, further enhancing the model's robustness and generalizability.
