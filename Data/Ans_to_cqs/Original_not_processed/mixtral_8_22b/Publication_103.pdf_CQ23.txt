the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

Experiments and results
All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accu-
racy of the trained deep learning model under different
circumstances, i.e., herbarium specimens classification
(“Herbarium specimen classification” section, Table 3),
transfer learning across herbarium data from differ-
ent regions (“Cross-Herbaria transfer learning” section,
Table 4), and transfer learning from herbarium data to
non-dried plant images (“Transfer learning from herbar-
ium to non-dried plant images” section, Table 5).

For each of these experiments, table columns are

defined as follows:

Table 1 shows the modified GoogleNet model with
the batch normalization added outside the Inception
modules. Just like the original GoogleNet, the model is
comprised of several inception modules, however Batch
Normalization is added inside each inception module for
faster convergence right after each pooling layer. Figure 1
shows how the modified Inception module is comprised.
The model was implemented by using the Caffe frame-
work [37]. A batch size of 16 images was used for each
iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075 with images of
224×224 resolution. Simple crop and resize data augmen-
tation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors conducted various experiments measuring the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the trained model under different circumstances. These included herbarium specimens classification, transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions, and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images.

In terms of diverse datasets, they utilized multiple datasets, including dataset A and dataset B, which likely contained varied samples to improve the model's ability to generalize well. Additionally, they employed transfer learning techniques to leverage knowledge gained from training on large datasets and apply it to smaller, more specific datasets. This approach can help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's adaptability to new tasks or domains.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting methods being applied in this context. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively training the model on different combinations of those subsets while validating its performance on the remaining subset. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent between the training and validation sets. While these techniques could have been used to further validate the model's performance, they are not explicitly mentioned in the given information.
