model was designed based on the VGG architecture. Unlike conventional 
VGG16 or VGG19 models (the numeric value corresponds to the number 
of layers), our CNN model contained only 12 layers (see Fig. 3).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of a VGG16-based CNN architecture called "CNN Model 4" for classifying underwater images into different environmental conditions such as clear, low light, air bubbles, etc. However, it does not mention any specific details regarding the availability of the source code for this model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is located.
