Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

tolerance of 0, and the least allowable gradient as 1e-5 (Fig. 5). The
experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6).

Data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. The network
ﬁnally converges after 50–100 iterations (repeated experiments) using
5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. The results predict
the 2014 total EF of Beijing to be 8726 ten thousand acres with an error
of 2% and a standard deviation of 1082, compared to the actual value of

8874 ten thousand acres. The 2015 value is predicted to be 8743 ten
thousand acres with an error of 3%, a standard deviation of 1193 and a
root mean square error (RMSE) of 121.65, compared to the actual value
of 8984 ten thousand acres. (Table 2).

BPNN is one of the most well-developed and widely used ANN
models (Partovi and Anandarajan, 2002; Zhang and Wu, 2008). Im-
pressive results have been achieved in the areas of carbon emissions
(Sun and Xu, 2016; Taghavifar and Mardani, 2015) and water issues
(Qaderi and Babanejad, 2017). However, the BPNN has a slow con-
vergence rate and tends to reach a local minimum, so the selection of
the number of hidden nodes in the network is uncertain (Byvatov et al.,
2003). When the classical support vector machine (SVM) was proposed
in the 1990s, it received extensive attention due to its complete theo-
retical framework and the encouraging results of its application in the
area of machine learning. Recently, SVM has been primarily used for
regression analysis because it requires relatively smaller sample sizes
across some time spans and is capable of overcoming the inevitable
local extremum issues caused by overﬁtting in an artiﬁcial neural net-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6) and that data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. There is no mention of any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
