learning  (ML)-based  methods  have  been 
employed for more accurate species distribution predictions (Rew et al., 
2020;  Saranya  et  al.,  2021).  Due  to  their  ability  to  capture  complex 
spatial patterns, they exhibit superior predictive performance compared 
with traditional methods. For instance, Bellin et al. (2022) showed that 
an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer outperforms 
GLM  in  their  distribution  prediction  experiments  using  27  environ-
mental variables for two zooplankton species. In addition, several well- 
known ML methods, including the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method 
(Phillips  et  al.,  2006),  and  various  ensemble  models  such  as  random 
forest  (RF)  (Ahmed  et  al.,  2021),  gradient  boosting  machine  (GBM) 
(Marmion et al., 2009), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) (Effrosynidis 
et  al.,  2020),  and  light  GBM  (LGBM)  (Effrosynidis  and  Arampatzis,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of deep neural networks in pseudo-label: The simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks by Lee, D.H. (2013). Deep learning pipelines often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam to minimize the loss function during model training. Without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique is being used in this case.
