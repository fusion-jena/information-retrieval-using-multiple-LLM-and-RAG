Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

6.  Prediction:  Use  the  data  that  the  model  has  not  seen  and  use  the 
aforementioned model and weight calculation to predict the answer. 

In order to better understand the environment and materials used in 
the study, the software, hardware, and  a series of  operations on data 
were introduced. In terms of execution environment, this study used an 
Intel Core i5-10400F CPU and a 64-GB memory. The GPU specification 
was ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 (24 GB memory). The execu-
tion environment was  the Windows 10 system version and the 64-bit 
version of Python 3.6.6. The GPU environment included CUDA Toolkit 
11.3, cuDNN v7.2.1, TensorFlow-gpu 2.5, and so on.

after the above training data preparation is as follows (Fig. 6). One of the 
optimal  simulation  results  (72band_256_16bit_split)  was  achieved 
through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution 
kernels, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that the researchers utilized various methods such as data augmentation, flattening convolution kernels, and adjusting dropout rates to optimize their models. They also employed different architectures like ResNet50 and VGG19+ResNet50, along with varying input bandwidths and bit depths. These techniques are commonly used to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting, which indirectly helps monitor model performance during training. Additionally, they presented tables containing calculated results using these parameters, indicating that they likely evaluated the model's performance based on these outcomes. Nonetheless, without further clarification or additional context, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
