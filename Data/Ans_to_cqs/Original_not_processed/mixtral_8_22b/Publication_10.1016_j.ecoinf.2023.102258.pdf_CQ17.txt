Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Then, for each sample xq  from the query set, a distance function is 
used  to  calculate  the  Euclidean  distance  of  xq  from  each  prototype, 
following which a softmax function over the distances produces a dis-
tribution over the classes. This directly implies that training the neural 
network to optimise these distances should move prototypes and their 
corresponding  query  points  closer  together  in  the  embedding  space 
created  by  fϕ,  and  further  away  from  non-matching  points.  In  other 
words, the training procedure creates a general representation in which 
similar  sounds  are  close  to  each  other.  Nearest-neighbour  algorithms 
such as k-means can then be used to label future data points—even those 
from novel categories, after a simple procedure of calculating the pro-
totype of a novel category as the centroid of its k shots.

Many machine learning systems have pragmatic design constraints 
that  limit  the  range  of  durations  they  can  consider.  Our  template- 
matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated 
events, although there remain practical limits on very large templates, 
such as computer memory. In deep learning, long audio files are usually 
divided into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g. 3 or 10 s), so 
that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of GPUs. To detect 
long  events,  detections  that  span  these  chunks  are  joined  together  in 
post-processing. This as well as other considerations meant that post- 
processing  of  outputs  was  an  important  aspect  of  all  strongly- 
performing systems.

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several techniques employed by various systems, such as using CNN architectures, framewise processing, and attention mechanisms. These techniques could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly by improving model generalization. For instance, convolutional layers in CNNs share weights across different spatial locations, reducing the number of parameters and helping prevent overfitting. Framewise processing involves breaking down longer audio sequences into smaller segments, which might also aid in preventing overfitting by simplifying the learning task. Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input, possibly leading to better generalization. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the implementation of these systems, we cannot definitively state whether any standard regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization were explicitly applied.
