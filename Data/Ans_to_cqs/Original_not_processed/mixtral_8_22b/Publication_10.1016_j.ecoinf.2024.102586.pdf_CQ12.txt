Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not provide details about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was employed. Further context would be required to accurately identify the type of deep learning model utilized in this case.
