undersampling  (Freeman  et  al.,  2012),  minor  category  oversampling 
(Rayhan  et  al.,  2017),  and  combinations  of  oversampling  and  under-
sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
