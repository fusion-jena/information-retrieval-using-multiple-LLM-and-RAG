torelli et al., 2014). Most machine learning approaches are not designed 
to handle training data that is not ‘pure’ or 100% representative of the 
target invader (Roberts et al., 1998).

version 2020a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). The data 
was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations. 
Before running, MTMI-SMF requires a few parameters to be set by the 
user.  After  experimentation  with  training-validation  approaches,  we 
used the following parameters: number of initialized targets was two, 
initialization  method  was  K-Means  clustering,  background  mean  and 
inverse covariance was calculated from only negative bags, and alpha 
was set to 0.1. For more information on these parameters, please refer to 
Meerdink et al., 2022. Once the parameters have been set, MTMI-SMF 
compares negative and positive bags and finds one or more target sig-
natures that best separates the target (e.g., Brazilian peppertree) from 
non-targets (e.g., other species, soil, water) (Fig. 4). Once target signa-
tures are applied to the data, Spectral Matched Filter (SMF) is used to

were calculated on the 20% of the data not used for training the algo-
rithm  (approximately  720  pixels  with  50  having  Brazilian peppertree 
present). The confusion matrix was calculated and the overall, producer, 
and user accuracy are reported.

MTMI-SMF is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be 
due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching 
with  image  pixels.  MTMI-SMF  groups  pixels  surrounding  a  training 
location  that  could  have  invader.  Most  other  machine  learning  algo-
rithms require a single pixel to represent a training location, which often 
leaves the user making an educated guess on which pixel best represents 
that training location. Here, we compare MTMI-SMF classification (i.e., 
confidence values with a threshold applied) to a commonly used ma-
chine learning classification approach, random forest.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations. This technique involves dividing the data into k subsets, where each subset serves as the test set exactly once while the remaining k−1 subsets are used for training. This process is repeated k times, ensuring that every observation has the chance of being validated against.

Secondly, before running the algorithm, MTMI-SMF required a few parameters to be set by the user. These parameters included the number of initialized targets, initialization method, background mean and inverse covariance, and alpha. After experimentation with training-validation approaches, specific parameters were chosen. This process helped to fine-tune the model and improve its performance.

Lastly, the model was tested on the 20% of the data not used for training the algorithm. A confusion matrix was calculated, and the overall, producer, and user accuracy were reported. This step allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance and ensured that it could accurately classify new, unseen data.
