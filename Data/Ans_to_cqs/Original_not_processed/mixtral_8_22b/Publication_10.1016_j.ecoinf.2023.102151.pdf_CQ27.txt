specific projects often require detailed soil information from a particular 
site,  delving  below  the  soil  surface  and  taking  into  account  varying 
depths. Technicians typically gather this information through soil sur-
veys and present it as raw data to professionals. However, this format 
can  create  challenges  in  effectively  communicating  and  collaborating 
across  disciplines.  Various  research  efforts  have  made  strides  in 
addressing these concerns: Yang et al. (2022) developed a framework for 
the  preliminary  delineation  of  soil  profile  horizons;  Alqadad  et  al. 
(2017)  documented  several  accidents that occurred  during urban  soil 
investigation  due  to  outdated  soil  profile  information;  Temme  and 
Vanwalleghem (2016) introduced a new model linking landscape and 
soil profile evolution based on sensitivity analysis; Pourabdollah et al. 
(2012)  proposed  a  data  exchange  schema  for  soil  and  terrain  data;

The  core  principle  of  node-based  programming  pertains  to  the 
employment of an abstracted node model for the representation of data 
or a computing operator. Each “node” accepts zero or multiple inputs and 
yields outputs subsequent to executing a computing operation. The scope 
of these computational operations encompasses elementary arithmetic 
tasks  as well  as intricate customized functions  necessitating consider-
able computational resources. (Fig. 8). 

The  intricacy  of  project  development  for  users  is  predominantly 
contingent upon the assortment of nodes supplied by both the software 
development  team  (intrinsic  default  functions)  and  community  de-
velopers  (plugin  functions).  A  robust  platform  typically  reaps  the  ad-
vantages  of  an  active  community-driven  ecosystem,  encompassing 
hundreds of plugins contributed by an array of sources. This, in turn, 
enables an extensive scope of functionality and customization for the 
end-users.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a suitable deployment platform, and then integrating the saved model into the chosen platform. However, without more details about the specific case, it's not possible to provide a precise answer.
