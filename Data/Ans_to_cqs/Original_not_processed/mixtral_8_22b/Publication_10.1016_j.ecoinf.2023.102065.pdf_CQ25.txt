Many 2D CNNs use well-labeled training and validation data from 
the study domain intended to optimize weights in existing image-based 
architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGGish, MobileNet), i.e., transfer learning. 
These data are usually hard to acquire and thus have low sample sizes. 
This often leads to the use of larger labeled data from outside the study 
domain.  Recent  BirdCLEF  competitions  use  weakly-labeled  audio

%Query
Query: "What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model was designed for classification tasks. Specifically, the model seems to be used for classifying bird species based on their vocalizations or sounds. This is suggested by the mention of "bird species classification" among the keywords and the reference to "automated birdsong recognition." Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) further supports this interpretation, as they are commonly employed for image and sound classification tasks. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model cannot be definitively determined without more specific information, it can be reasonably inferred that its primary function was likely bird species classification.
