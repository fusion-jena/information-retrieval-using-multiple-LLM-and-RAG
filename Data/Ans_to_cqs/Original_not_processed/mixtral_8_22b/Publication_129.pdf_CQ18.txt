5.2. Results

Fig. 4 shows a sample of detection and classiﬁcation results
using the developed recognition system based on Faster R-
CNN. High classiﬁcation accuracy was achieved for all tested
images of insect pests in the range of 97.0 to 99.0%. Moreover,
the developed UI of our mobile application is depicted in
Fig. 5, monitoring the identiﬁcation results; for example, in

case of the ﬂea beetles with a summary including the suggested
pesticides such as Neem oil and insecticidal soaps for guiding
farmers.

5.3. Comparative performance evaluation

The overall performance of developed system for insect pest
recognition has been evaluated using four basic classiﬁcation

executed repetitively until it gives the successful result. It is also
possible for the user to retry the failed and/or unsuccessful task
manually [50]. Second, the failed task of agricultural pest
recognition is re-submitted to the same resource or another
mobile device for completing the software execution correctly
[47].

We are currently working on extending the number of
insect pest classes in our database, considering speciﬁc crops
either in the open ﬁeld or greenhouses. That will also support
the farmers to perform multi-class classiﬁcation of targeted
crop pests simultaneously, as presented in Ref. [51]. Moreover,
security and privacy algorithms of analyzed images [52,53] for
transmission over public mobile networks can be also involved
in the proposed cloud computing system , as shown in Fig. 4.
Nevertheless, the current version of our developed mobile-
based application is still valid and accurate to identify agricul-
tural pests successfully.

Next, the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the
region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature
map and dividing it into sub-windows. The maximum pooling
is performed over these sub-windows to give the output of RoI
pooling layer, which has a size of (N, 7, 7, 512), and N is the
number of generated region proposals by the RPN mechanism,
as shown in Fig. 2. After passing through two fully connected
layers (FCs), the features are fed into the classiﬁer and regres-
sor branches as follow. The classiﬁcation layer calculates the
probability of the region proposal contains an object such that
the probability Pi of each element in the feature map i contains
the target object using softmax function. The regions with the
top score of 300 Pi in the total rankings present the detected
target object. In addition, the regressor provides the IoU index

on ﬁve crop pest classes using the same image dataset.

Helpful Answer:
During the training process, the authors used a technique called cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their model. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple sets, where one set is used for testing while the others are used for training. This allows the authors to assess how well their model generalizes to new data. Additionally, the authors monitored the loss function during training to ensure that the model was improving. They also used techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Overall, the authors took several steps to ensure that their model was performing well during training and would be able to accurately detect and classify insect pests in real-world scenarios.
