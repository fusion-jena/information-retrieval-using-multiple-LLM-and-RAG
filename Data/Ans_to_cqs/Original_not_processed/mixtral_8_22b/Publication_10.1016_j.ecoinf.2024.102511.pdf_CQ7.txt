Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

properly apply and test neural network classification methods on a novel 
dataset,  although  development  of  more  user  friendly  tools  are  in 
development (Kahl et al., 2021; Kirsebom et al., 2022). Despite the great 
potential for deep learning methods, modification of existing machine 
learning  methods  with  a  lower  barrier  to  entry  may  be  sufficient  for 
many bioacoustic classification tasks.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

%Query
Query: "What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified split or time series split when dealing with temporal data like acoustic signals. The typical ratio for splitting the dataset is 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This allows the model to learn from a majority of the data while also having separate subsets to evaluate its performance and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the optimal split ratios can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
