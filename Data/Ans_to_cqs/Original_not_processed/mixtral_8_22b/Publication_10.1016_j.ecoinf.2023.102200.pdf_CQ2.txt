Individual  mangrove  trees,  low  shrubs,  and  other  classes  were 
labelled  manually  on  the  BEV  images,  and  the  BEV  images  with 
bounding  box  labels  were  used  to  train  the  Faster  R-CNN  detector. 
During the detector operation, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet- 
101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (with momentum), with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 
0.9,  and  a  batch  size  of  1.  The  network  was  initialised  with  weights 
developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned primarily focus on remote sensing applications, specifically in wetland and forest environments. They use various types of data such as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery, Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and Multiple View Geometry (MVG) data. These datasets are typically processed into raster or vector format before being fed into deep learning models.

For instance, Liu et al. (2018) employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify wetlands using UAS imagery. Similarly, Marasigan et al. (2019) utilized airborne LiDAR data to measure mangrove crown diameters. Martins et al. (2021) applied machine learning techniques along with Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) for segmenting tree canopies in urban areas using high-resolution satellite imagery.

In another application, Jin et al. (2018) used Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) combined with Regional Growth Algorithms (RGAs) to perform individual maize segmentation from terrestrial LiDAR data. Furthermore, Mohammadimanesh et al. (2019) developed a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of Polarimetric SAR imagery.

Lastly, Peng et al. (2021) measured tree heights in degraded tropical forests using UAV-LiDAR data of varying point cloud densities. Overall, these studies demonstrate the utilization of diverse data formats, including images, point clouds, and geospatial vectors, within deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications.
