The values show averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model. The percentage 
contribution determines the jackknife; in each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding 
variable. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on 
the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

the index that identifies the total precipitation that occurs during the

is  a  quarterly  index  that  indicates  the  total  precipitation  that  occurs 
during the coldest quarter (millimetres); and 6) ‘Slope’ in % values of the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available about the specific hyperparameters used for the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it can be seen from the given context that the maximum number of iterations was used with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage. Additionally, the output of the MaxEnt model was analyzed, and the results were presented as averages of 10 replicate runs.
