Alibhai  et  al.,  2023)  further  simplifies  the  approach,  increasing  effi-
ciency in the FIT process by requiring fewer landmark points, and also 
making it easier to employ on tracks of varying quality that may lack 
edge definition.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not directly mention any specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some general preprocessing steps might include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data, missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries. In this case, we see that outliers were identified and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses.

2. Normalization or Scaling: These techniques help bring all features into the same range, which is essential when dealing with different units or scales. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization, or Log transformation. The context does not explicitly state if these techniques were applied.

3. Feature Selection or Extraction: Choosing relevant input variables (features) for the model can improve its performance and reduce overfitting. Sometimes, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are employed to extract more informative features. There is no explicit mention of feature selection or extraction in the given context.

4. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets helps evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. From Table 1, we observe that the dataset was split into training, validation, and test groups for both Fisher sex discrimination and Marten tracks.
