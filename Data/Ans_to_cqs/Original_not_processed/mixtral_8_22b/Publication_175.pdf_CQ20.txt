Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

1)  We  trained  a  classic  DL  algorithms  architecture  with  our  biggest 

dataset AT0 as a baseline for the DL accuracy;  

2)  We  trained  the  same  DL  architecture  with  the  same  hyper- 
parameters (e.g. model architecture and training process) but on a 
much  more  limited  dataset  (AT1).  Hyper-parameters  are  the  pa-
rameters  defining  the  architecture (number of  layers, number and 
size of convolutions, connections between layers) and the training 
process  of  a  Deep  Model  (learning  rate,  neurone  activation,  back- 
propagation compotation).;  

3)  We trained the same DL architecture with limited datasets obtained 
by  subsampling  T0  to  250  and  500  images  per  class  (here  after 
“species” when we are referring to our experiments), corresponding 
to 2500 and 5000 thumbnails in AT0;

a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1–5 thumbnails per 
class.

4)  We  pre-trained  a  FSL  architecture  on  the  64  training  classes  of 
MiniImageNet (Supp. Fig. 3) and used T0 to build support sets (SS) 
with 1, 5, 15 and 30 thumbnails for each fish species;  

5)  We pre-trained the same FSL architecture on MiniImageNet and used 
the more limited T1 dataset to build support sets with 1, 5, 15 and 30 
images per species.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process based solely on this context.
