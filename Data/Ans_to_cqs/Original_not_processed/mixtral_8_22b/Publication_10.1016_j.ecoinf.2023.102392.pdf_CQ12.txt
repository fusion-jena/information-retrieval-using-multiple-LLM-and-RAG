have  demonstrated  that  deep  learning  models  perform  well  in  object 
recognition and categorization (Shetty, 2019; Talukdar et al., 2020). In 
particular, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model has gained 
popularity  due  to  its  ability  to  identify  features  and  patterns  in  large 
image datasets (Friedman, 2001; Hamedianfar et al., 2022). Neverthe-
less, the application of deep learning models to detect and categorize 
forest  types  utilizing  high  spatial  and  ultra-high  resolution  remote 
sensing data is still uncommon (Georganos et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
risk of forest fire is also affected by the features of the forest condition 
(Reich et al., 2001). During dry weather, the forest states with numerous 
oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves will burn more quickly 
than in other forest conditions (Doran et al., 2004; Ebright et al., 2023; 
Hardison,  1976).  As  a  result,  reliable  forest-type  categorization  is

(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid

model (Alkhatib et al., 2023). This study aims to enhance further the use 
of  deep  learning  models  in  overlay  categorization  utilizing  images

equipment with flexibility.

%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is being used in the proposed pipeline. However, it does state that the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model has been popularly used for image recognition tasks. It should be noted that XGBoost is not a traditional deep learning model but rather a tree ensemble method. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), or transformer model is being employed in this case. Further clarification would be required from additional sources or documentation related to this research project.
