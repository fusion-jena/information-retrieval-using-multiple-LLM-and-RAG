3. Results 

3.1. Soil nutrient concentration analysis

parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values (De San-
tana  et  al.,  2021).  SVM  was  performed  in  MATLAB  R2016a,  and  the 
training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB.

%Query
Query: "What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others have been applied in this case.
