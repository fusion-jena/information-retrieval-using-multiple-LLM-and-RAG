Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2. Methods 

2.1. CNN training data

From our own experience, we frequently observe that CNN output is

2.3. Implementation and training 

The  CNN  was  implemented  using  the  Keras  (Chollet,  2015)  and 
TensorFlow  (Abadi  et  al.,  2016)  software  packages  implemented  in 
Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and 
CuDNN  with  Nvidia  (Nvidia  Corp.,  Santa  Clara,  California)  P100 
accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. We used a Keras imple-
mentation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 (https://github. 
com/qubvel/efficientnet).  The  pre-trained  weights  used  for  transfer 
learning were available through this API.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. Specifically, it employs an implementation of EfficientNet--B4, which is a variant of the EfficientNet family of models. These models are designed to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, and computations were carried out using CUDA and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards.
