whole image. Thus, it may minimize the dilution effect and reduce the 
required amount of training data.

Data  augmentation  is  another  powerful  method  to  overcome  the 
problem of limited data and improve model performance (Shorten and 
Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Data augmentation can increase the variability of 
audio  data  in  a  training  dataset  by  transforming  the  data,  such  as 
changing  the  frequency,  pitch,  and  volume  of  audio  signals,  shifting, 
rotating  and  zooming  in  the  time  and/or  frequency  domains  of  spec-
trograms, and adding additional noise (Dai et al., 2021; Ferreira et al., 
2020; Kahl et al., 2021; Lasseck, 2019; Nanni et al., 2020b; Ruff et al., 
2021). Since the augmented dataset can better represent the real-world 
data  than  the  original  dataset,  this  approach  can  improve  the  model 
performance trained with a small dataset (Nanni et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 
2019). However, previous studies show that this approach works well 
only  on  relatively  clean  recordings,  not  soundscape  recordings  (Kahl

Data augmentation is a powerful tool for enriching a limited amount 
of training datasets. Some audio-specific augmentation techniques, such 
as noise mixing and random signal amplitude used in the SILIC, are also 
used and performed well in previous studies (Lasseck, 2019; Nanni et al., 
2020b; Kahl et al., 2021). Techniques such as sound mixing with other 
target  signals  and/or  reverberations  also  have  the  potential  for 
improving  the  model  performance  (Ko  et  al.,  2017;  Lasseck,  2019; 
Richards and Wiley, 1980) and warrant further evaluations.

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions two strategies employed to address the issue of limited data and potentially mitigate overfitting: transfer learning and data augmentation.

Transfer learning involves utilizing pretrained models from large datasets and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets. This technique allows the model to leverage previously learned features and reduces the need for extensive training data. In this case, the authors use YOLOv5s, which is likely a pretrained model, to build their sound identification model.

Data augmentation is another strategy mentioned in the text to enhance the diversity of the training dataset. By applying various transformations to the existing data, such as changing frequency, pitch, and volume, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise, the authors aim to create a more representative dataset. This approach helps improve the model's performance when trained on a small dataset and could indirectly contribute to reducing overfitting.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they serve similar purposes in preventing overfitting and improving model generalization.
