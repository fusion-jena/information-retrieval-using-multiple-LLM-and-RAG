4.3.1. Data description

4.2. Experimental setup 

During the training phase, to accommodate multivariate input and 
univariate output, the input and output dimensions of the encoder and 
decoder  are set  to the  number of variables  in the  dataset. The model 
dimensionality  is  set  to  128  to  achieve  a  balance  between  model 
complexity  and  computational  efficiency.  Additionally,  the  model  in-
tegrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel in-
formation flows. The model architecture includes two layers of encoders 
and one layer of decoders, which help to comprehensively capture fea-
tures from time series data. To reduce the risk of overfitting, a dropout 

4.3.2. Results for the Shandong peninsula

This research contributes significantly to the long-term prediction of 
multivariate  marine  chemical  data,  confirming  the  necessity  and 
importance  of  signal  decomposition,  reducing  feature  space  redun-
dancy,  and  uncovering  potential  feature  correlations  in  this  field. 
Complementarily, related machine learning and deep learning studies 
have also made progress in predicting DO concentrations. For instance, 
Hu  et  al.  (2024)  presented  a  hybrid  deep  learning  architecture  that 
achieved an R2  of 0.865 in predicting river and stream water quality. 
Feng  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  the  WTD-GWO-SVR  ensemble  method, 
which combines wavelet threshold denoising, gray wolf optimization, 
and support vector regression, and achieved an MAE of 0.038 and an R2 
of  0.997.  Ikram  et  al.  (2023)  developed  an  innovative  approach  for 
estimating the water temperature of the Bailong River in China, inte-

2.2. Transformer 

Since its introduction by Vaswani and others in 2017 Vaswani et al. 
(2017), the Transformer model has led to a significant revolution in the 
field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key innovations of 
the  Transformer  is  the  self-attention  mechanism,  which  allows  the 
model  to  weigh  the  importance  of  different  parts  of  the  input  data 
differently.  The  core  self-attention  mechanism  is  represented  by  For-

Here,  Q,  K,  and  V  represent  the  query,  key,  and  value  matrices, 
respectively.  The  query  matrix  represents  the  current  word  or  token 
being processed, while the key and value matrices represent the entire

input sequence. The term 
dk
is a scaling factor used to normalize the 
dot products, where dk  is the dimensionality of the keys.

Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the available text snippets.
