Traditional means and algorithms lack the ability to quantitatively analyze the drivers and
mechanisms of LUCC, and the accumulation of massive data over the years provides the possibility of
using deep learning models for related explorations. The probability of the LU distribution can be
determined by a deep learning model. The LU probability cannot determine whether a certain LU
type exists at that time; its function is to determine the distribution probability of a variety of LU types
in a spatial unit, and the probability is the basis for the SM.

Figure 4 introduces the adopted DM. In the DM, the grid with the neighborhood features includes
the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, and all grid
units are input into the DM in series. The deep learning method can model complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, ﬁt the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the
SM, and perform further LU simulations.

mask. (3) Training set: grid with neighborhood features of six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). The features include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. (4) Constraint Factors: The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined, and the numbers of different LU types in 2000 after modification by the simulation numbers are as follows (Table 1): 2.4.2. Deep Learning Module Probability maps (Figure 9): Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.  Figure 9.

Abstract: In recent decades, land use/cover change (LUCC) due to urbanization, deforestation,
and desertiﬁcation has dramatically increased, which changes the global landscape and increases the
pressure on the environment. LUCC not only accelerates global warming but also causes widespread
and irreversible loss of biodiversity. Therefore, LUCC reconstruction has important scientiﬁc and
practical value for studying environmental and ecological changes. The commonly used LUCC
reconstruction models can no longer meet the growing demand for uniform and high-resolution
LUCC reconstructions. In view of this circumstance, a deep learning-integrated LUCC reconstruction
model (DLURM) was developed in this study. Zhenlai County of Jilin Province (1986–2013) was taken
as an example to verify the proposed DLURM. The average accuracy of the DLURM reached 92.87%
(compared with the results of manual interpretation). Compared with the results of traditional models,

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It focuses on describing the development and application of a deep learning-integrated LUCC reconstruction model (DLURM), using Zhenlai County of Jilin Province as an example. The paper discusses the limitations of traditional LUCC reconstruction models and presents the advantages of using deep learning methods for LUCC analysis. However, it does not mention any specific code repository links or share any source code related to the deep learning pipeline used in their research.
