2.3. Modeling framework

1.4. Modeling approaches 

Modeling also includes selection of the classifier (or probability of 
occurrence estimator), which encompasses hundreds of different options 
(FernÂ´andez-Delgado  et  al.,  2014),  although  general  linear  models, 
MaxEnt,  and  random  forests  are  among  the  most  commonly  applied 
classifiers  (Santini  et  al.,  2021).  For  the  selected  classifier,  modeling 
package  options  enable  automated  tuning  for  parameters  through 
resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final 
model configuration. Multiple methods may be applied to detect over-
lapping outcomes, allowing some strength of evidence within a study 
rather  than  only  comparing  support  from  other  studies,  but  multiple 
methods may be too burdensome when hundreds or thousands of models 
are generated due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, 
and time intervals.

random forests. Predictive modeling is a practical approach for informing variable selection, including retention 
of correlated climate variables, which create a reliable basis for accurate predictions.

correlated predictors, only a subset of variables is considered for each 
tree and the rule at each branch is constructed with a single variable 
threshold. In the case of a reduced set of two input variables, random 
forests still 1) bootstraps samples from training data, 2) selects a feature

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the application of various machine learning techniques like General Linear Models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Random Forests for classification tasks. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
