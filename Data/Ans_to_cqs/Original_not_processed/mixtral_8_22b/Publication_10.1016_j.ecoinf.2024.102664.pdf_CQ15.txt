performance compared to other optimizers. This could be a significant 
reason for the superior performance of Adam. Specifically, in most in-
stances where Adam is used as the solver and the input time series length 
is set to 5 days, the RMSE of the validation data forecasting results is 
lower. Therefore, we adopt Adam as the solver for training the network, 
with the input time series length set to 5 days. 

2.4. Model training and forecast

In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The occurrence of algal blooms is influenced by complex interplay of 
climate,  hydrography,  biology,  physical  and  chemical  factors  (Miya-
guchi, 2006; Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012). The intricate and 
nonlinear  interactions  among  these  factors  pose  challenges  for  tradi-
tional forecasting methods. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), rooted in 
human  learning  mechanisms,  offer  unique  advantages  in  addressing 
such multivariate and nonlinear problems (Lee et al., 2003; Yang et al., 
2003).  Deep  learning,  an  advanced  branch  derived  from  ANNs,  has 
gained  prominence  in  artificial  intelligence,  especially  in  forecasting 
complex marine environmental parameters (Gambin et al., 2021; Ham 
et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Due to the complex and diverse causes of 
algal  blooms  in  different  regions,  there  is  an  urgent  requirement  for 
customized deep learning models to achieve accurate forecasting in the 
Zhoushan fishery.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Three optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline: adam, sgdm, and RMSProp. These techniques are used as solvers for training networks in the deep learning models. The table shows the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for each optimization technique when used with different input time series lengths and deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM. Based on the analysis, it was found that Adam had better performance compared to other optimizers, particularly when the input time series length was set to 5 days. Therefore, Adam was adopted as the solver for training the network.
