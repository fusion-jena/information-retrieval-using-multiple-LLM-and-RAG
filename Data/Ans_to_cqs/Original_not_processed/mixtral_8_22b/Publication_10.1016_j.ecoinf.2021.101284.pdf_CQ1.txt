of districts within the NUTS3 units. 

In summary, it should be emphasized that both the environmental 
data, i.e. the information related to population and geographic condi-
tions, and the air pollution data, are of the Big Data type. Its volume is in 
the order of terabytes in size.

• % of the population employed in industry (INDST, source: GUS) – 
this  indicates  the  degree  of  contribution  of  industrial  or  mining 
workplace to the emergence of disease outbreaks (Money.pl, 2020);  
• distance from land border crossings (BOR, source: OpenStreetMap) – 
this item indicates the ‘internationalization’ of a given district, and 
serves as a means of revealing the degree of possible contact with 
infected people coming from abroad;  

• access  to  medical  assistance  (DOC,  source:  GUS)  –  this  factor  is 
representative of the extent of locally available medical services – the 
number of doctors per 100 thousand residents;

Helpful Answer:
The study by P.A. Kowalski et al. utilizes various sources for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. For instance, they use data from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) such as the percentage of the population employed in industry (INDST), which serves as an indicator of the potential impact of industrial workplaces on disease outbreaks. Additionally, they employ data from OpenStreetMap like the distance from land border crossings (BOR), which helps determine the 'internationalization' of a particular district and reveals the likelihood of contact with infected individuals from other countries. Furthermore, they gather information about access to medical assistance (DOC) from GUS, representing the availability of local medical services through the number of doctors per 100,000 residents. Although not explicitly mentioned, these data collection methods suggest the use of publicly accessible datasets and possibly surveys or sensor data to obtain relevant information for their research.
