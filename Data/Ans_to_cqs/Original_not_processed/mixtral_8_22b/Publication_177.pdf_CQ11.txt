al.  [26]  ensembled  the  results  of  GoogleNet  and  VGG 
networks  to  obtain  an  accuracy  of  80.18%  on  a  validation 
dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. A bagging ensemble of 
three ResNet152-layered CNN networks was used by Šulc and

precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset [27].

training while 40% of the images were used for testing. In 
order to develop and compare the models for both datasets, 
we split the original 40% testing data into validation (20%) 
and testing (20%). So, the final distribution of the dataset 
was  60%  for  training,  20%  for  validation,  and  20%  for 
testing.

B.  Deep Learning Models

Similar to [22], Wu et al. [23] proposed a taxonomic loss 
that takes into account the higher taxonomic classification of 
the  species  to  update  CNN  weights  during  training.  Using 
SENet-154  trained  on  PlantCLEF  2017  dataset,  the  model 
achieved  an  improved  accuracy  of  84.07%,  79.97%,  and 
73.61% at family, genus, and species levels compared to the 
traditional cross-entropy loss. The diversity of deep learning 
models  is  becoming  essential  in  improving  the  overall 
performance  in  plant  identification  task  [16].  This  enables 
different CNN models with different network configurations 
to learn diverse features to improve the overall performance 
[24].  For  example,  Haupt  et  al.  [24]  ensembled  the 
performance of ResNet50 and two DenseNet201 to obtain a 
top-1 accuracy of 77% on the PlantCLEF 2017 dataset. On the 
other hand, Lasseck  obtained a  top-1  accuracy of 88.5% on 
PlantCLEF 2017 dataset by ensemble results of twelve deep
