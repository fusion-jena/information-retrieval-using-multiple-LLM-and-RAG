In Eq. (7), n is the number of trees included in the sample at a given 
sample point, i.e. the number of sample trees. In the remainder of this 
paper, we referred to Eq. (7) as the inventory estimator.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention any details about the type of data used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
