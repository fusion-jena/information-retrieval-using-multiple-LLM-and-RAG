Leveraging  cloud  computing  and  machine  learning  to  analyze 
remotely sensed data has great potential to create novel tools and fill 
crucial information gaps for invasive species monitoring. Particularly, 
when coupled with high resolution data, machine learning methods can 
be a powerful way to detect invasive species occupying a small fraction 
of the landscape and impacting critical and endangered ecosystems. The 
map of 2020 iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County is an example of 
such a combination of machine learning, cloud computing, and remotely 
sensed data analysis. This is the first ever map of iceplant at this scale, 
immediately  useful  for  restoration  and  conservation  efforts  in  Santa 
Barbara  County,  in  particular  in  the  Jack  and  Laura  Dangermond

destructive  species.  The  assessment  was  developed  through  a  data 
analysis pipeline centered on supervised ML classification algorithms to 
identify iceplant in freely available aerial images from the 2020 National 
Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) archive at 0.6 m/pixel resolution. 
This open, reproducible, and adaptable workflow provides a large-scale 
detailed understanding of the location and area occupied by a harmful 
invasive species and opens a path toward repeating this assessment over 
time and transferring it to other regions.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that leveraging cloud computing and machine learning to analyze remotely sensed data has great potential to create novel tools and fill crucial information gaps for invasive species monitoring. It also states that the map of 2020 iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County is an example of such a combination of machine learning, cloud computing, and remotely sensed data analysis. Therefore, we can infer that some form of cloud computing platform was likely used to deploy the deep learning model, but without further details, we cannot determine if it was specifically AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
