hyperparameters for the base model in terms of accuracy, which in-
dicates the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples
in the validation set. The four heterogeneous ensemble models were
founded on these optimized base models. Although the ensembles were
constructed from the optimized base models, the meta-models in
stacking and blending are critically important and require special
attention. Therefore, an additional layer of optimization was introduced
for fine-tuning the meta model parameters of stacking and blending.

The entire dataset was randomly divided into a training set (60%), a
validation set (20%), and a testing set (20%). Each ML model was
trained on the training set, optimized on the validation set, and evalu-
ated on the testing set (Fig. 3).

The RF, MLP, LR, NB, and stacking ensemble were implemented in
the scikit-learn package (V.1.0.2) in Python 3.7. The CAT, LGB, XGB,

Numbers of observed samples and ratios for each grade (Grade A, B, C, D, and E). The values are the sample counts in each grade and the ratios (in parentheses) are the
proportions of the samples in each grade relative to the total number of samples.

During this process the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous
ensemble models were set to those optimized by the TPE algorithms.
Each ML model was trained on 100 different subsets generated from the
original training sets using the bootstrap method (sampling with
replacement). The number of samples in each subset equaled the num-
ber of samples in the original training data. The predictions of the
trained models on the testing dataset were averaged to obtain the main
prediction. The average loss, average bias, and average variance were
then derived for each model. The noise was assumed as 0 following
previous studies (Domingos, 2000; Kohavi and Wolpert, 1996).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the machine learning models are evaluated on their performance on a testing set after being trained on a separate training set and optimized on a validation set. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training should be stopped or considered complete. Typically, common stopping criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on the validation set (such as a minimum validation loss), or observing a plateau in the validation loss over several epochs. Without more detailed information about the specific implementation of the machine learning models, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
