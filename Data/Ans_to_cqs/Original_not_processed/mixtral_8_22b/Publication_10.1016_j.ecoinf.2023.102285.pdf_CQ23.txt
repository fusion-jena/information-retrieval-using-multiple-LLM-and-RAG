Phase III. Evaluation using recent surveys (Fig. 3 III): A dataset 
was  prepared  to  evaluate  the  eligibility  of  the  methodology.  This  set 
consists of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images with no ISMM-
MOs. This set is not included in the dataset used for the establishment of 

the  methodology  to  observe  if  the  methodology  works  as  desired  for 
other independent datasets. The test results are displayed in Table 10 B. 
We moved to the next phase to verify the system with field experts using 
other  independent  datasets  after  the  satisfactory  results  (Se,  Sp,  PPV, 
NPV, and ACC > 0.95) obtained in this phase. 

Phase  IV.  Validation  by  field  experts  using  the  most  recent 
surveys (Fig. 3 IV): Furthermore, in an independent verification dataset,

completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. 
The model can be deployed if it passes these three phases successfully. 
These phases are outlined in Fig. 3. The obtained results as well as their 
evaluation  are  provided  in  the  following  section.  The  experimental 
design of data utilisation and data processing phases with their targeted 
objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM‘s database. The

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. These include:

1. Using diverse datasets: The study utilized various datasets consisting of different types of objects and environments. For instance, the dataset used for establishing the methodology consisted of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images without ISMMMOs. Additionally, another independent dataset was used for validation by field experts.

2. Cross-validation: To further validate the performance of the model, it was evaluated using recent surveys. This involved preparing a dataset to assess the eligibility of the methodology. The test results were then presented in Table 10 B.

3. Stratified splitting: The dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation sets. This allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its ability to generalize to new data.

4. Independent verification dataset: After obtaining satisfactory results in Phase III, the system was validated by field experts using other independent datasets. This step aimed to confirm whether the methodology worked as intended for other datasets.

Overall, these measures helped ensure the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model, enabling it to perform well on new, unseen data.
