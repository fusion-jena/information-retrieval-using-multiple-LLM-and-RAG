their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

3.5.2. Modified to K levels 

As illustrated in Fig. 5, we divided the baseline model into two parts. 
The trunk network comprises the Entry flow, the Middle flow, and the 
first DSC block of the Exit flow, while the last two separable convolution 
layers  are  merged  into  one  hierarchical  block.  We  copied  the  hierar-
chical block K times for K-level semantic feature learning. 

By  performing  an  orthogonal  decomposition  of  features,  discrimi-
native  features  are  separated  from  fine  level  region  representations. 
Then,  the  specific  hierarchical  feature  can  be  calculated  using  the 
following formula: 

Fh,k(x) = Sk(x) + λSorth

3.5.3. Hierarchical interaction

The study of bird populations is crucial for biodiversity research and conservation. Deep artificial neural net-
works  have  revolutionized  bird  acoustic  recognition;  however,  most  methods  overlook  inherent  relationships 
among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. To address this limitation, we propose the 
Phylogenetic  Perspective  Neural  Network  (PPNN),  which  incorporates  hierarchical  multilevel  labels  for  each 
bird. PPNN uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels. 
Attention  mechanisms  are  employed  to  extract  and  select  common  and  distinguishing  features,  thereby 
improving classification accuracy. We also propose a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions. 
Experimental results on bird acoustic datasets demonstrate that PPNN outperforms current methods, achieving

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two benchmark datasets - BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S) and BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L) - which were recorded in Europe and America. This suggests that audio recordings could be a method for gathering raw data. Additionally, another dataset called Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS) was mentioned, with its recordings being made in China. Therefore, it can be inferred that audio recording devices or sensors might be used for capturing raw data in these cases. Publicly available datasets may also be utilized for obtaining raw data.
