Citizen  science  consists  in  the  active  and  direct  involvement  of 
members of the general public in scientific research, particularly data 
collection,  analysis,  and  monitoring,  to  increase  scientific  knowledge 
(Fraisl et al., 2022). In the last decade, increasing partnerships between 
citizens  and  scientists  have  improved  public  engagement  and  conser-
vation efforts worldwide (Kelly et al., 2020). Scuba divers are the marine 
users that contribute the most to some marine citizen science initiatives, 
both in terms of quantity and duration (Lucrezi et al., 2018; Martin et al., 
2016). They can help speed up the scientific process by allowing more 
information to be obtained with reduced costs, time, and resources for 
tasks that would otherwise require more substantial efforts to be per-
formed  at the required temporal  or spatial scales  (e.g., Lucrezi  et  al., 
2018). In addition to data gathering, scuba divers can contribute to data
