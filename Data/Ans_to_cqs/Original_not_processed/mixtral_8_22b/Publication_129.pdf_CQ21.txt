Next, the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the
region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature
map and dividing it into sub-windows. The maximum pooling
is performed over these sub-windows to give the output of RoI
pooling layer, which has a size of (N, 7, 7, 512), and N is the
number of generated region proposals by the RPN mechanism,
as shown in Fig. 2. After passing through two fully connected
layers (FCs), the features are fed into the classiﬁer and regres-
sor branches as follow. The classiﬁcation layer calculates the
probability of the region proposal contains an object such that
the probability Pi of each element in the feature map i contains
the target object using softmax function. The regions with the
top score of 300 Pi in the total rankings present the detected
target object. In addition, the regressor provides the IoU index

executed repetitively until it gives the successful result. It is also
possible for the user to retry the failed and/or unsuccessful task
manually [50]. Second, the failed task of agricultural pest
recognition is re-submitted to the same resource or another
mobile device for completing the software execution correctly
[47].

We are currently working on extending the number of
insect pest classes in our database, considering speciﬁc crops
either in the open ﬁeld or greenhouses. That will also support
the farmers to perform multi-class classiﬁcation of targeted
crop pests simultaneously, as presented in Ref. [51]. Moreover,
security and privacy algorithms of analyzed images [52,53] for
transmission over public mobile networks can be also involved
in the proposed cloud computing system , as shown in Fig. 4.
Nevertheless, the current version of our developed mobile-
based application is still valid and accurate to identify agricul-
tural pests successfully.

e.g. machine learning and artiﬁcial neural networks, have been
widely employed in previous studies to solve the above prob-
lems in the agricultural ﬁeld.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Some common postprocessing techniques include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are used to visualize the areas of an input image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. This technique involves generating heatmaps that highlight the pixels in the input image that had the greatest impact on the model's decision-making process. By examining these heatmaps, researchers can gain insights into how the model is making its predictions and identify any potential biases or errors in the model's reasoning.

Metrics calculation is another important postprocessing step that helps researchers quantify the performance of their models. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics provide a numerical measure of the model's ability to accurately classify inputs and detect anomalies. Researchers can use these metrics to compare different models and select the best one for deployment.

Confusion matrices are a useful tool for evaluating the performance of classification models. They provide a summary of the predicted and actual labels for a set of test data, allowing researchers to see where the model is performing well and where it may need improvement. By analyzing the confusion matrix, researchers can identify patterns in the model's misclassifications and develop strategies for improving its performance.

In conclusion, postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrices are essential tools for evaluating the performance of trained models. By leveraging these techniques, researchers can gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their models and optimize them for real-world applications.
