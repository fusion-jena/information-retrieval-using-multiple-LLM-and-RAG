vancements in deep learning to enhance performance. Specifically, our 
MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons 
and connected with residual connections (He et al., 2016). We employ 
batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where 
instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. 
The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the 
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). Both the weight decay 
and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, we employ a learning 
rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95, and introduce dropout

types (Botella et al., 2023; Teng et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). As a 
result, we intend to expand this research to datasets involving various 
types of data, such as environmental rasters, satellite images, or time 
series  data,  as  exemplified  by  the  GeoLifeCLEF  2023  dataset  (Botella 
et al., 2023). An interesting avenue to explore is whether the behavior of 
the full weighted loss function remains consistent across various neural 
network  architectures,  including  more  complex  models  such  as  con-
volutional  neural  networks  (Krizhevsky  et  al.,  2012)  or  Transformers 
(Vaswani et al., 2017). 

6. Conclusion

3. Methods 

We introduce a new loss function for SDMs, described in Section 3.1. 
This  loss  function  incorporates  dataset-dependent  weights  that  get 
tailored  to  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  data.  In  Section  3.2,  we 
advocate for the use of block cross-validation to determine the optimal 
values of these weights. While the loss function is applicable to any deep 
learning  method,  we  employ  in  our  experiments  a  particular  multi- 
species  neural  network  model  that  is  detailed  in  Section  3.3.  Subse-
quently, we provide an overview of the dataset in use in Section 3.4, and 
elaborate on our evaluation methodology in Section 3.5. 

3.1. Full weighted loss function 

In  light  of  the  considerations  discussed  above,  we  propose  an 
extension of L full. We refer to this new loss function as the full weighted 
loss function, defined as follows:   

L full(cid:0) weighted(y, ̂y) = (cid:0) 1

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the authors have employed a deep learning approach utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture consisting of four layers, each containing 512 neurons. The input data format for this deep learning pipeline isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, considering the application of the model for Species Distribution Models (SDMs), it could potentially involve various types of data such as environmental rasters, satellite images, or time series data. This assumption is further supported by the mention of the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset, which includes diverse data types. Therefore, while not directly stated, the deep learning pipeline might handle multiple data formats like images (satellite images), time series data, and possibly others depending on the nature of the environmental raster data.
