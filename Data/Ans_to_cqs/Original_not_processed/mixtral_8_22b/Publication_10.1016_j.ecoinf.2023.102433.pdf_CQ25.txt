2.  According to the cloud architecture, GEE is a SaaS (Software-as-a- 
service). This translates into services (e.g., available datasets, allo-
cated resources, implemented algorithms, export data formats, and 
so on) entirely managed by Google and not (or hardly) modifiable by 
the single user. For instance, in GEE deep learning analysis can be 
performed  using  Tensorflow,  a  machine  learning  and  artificial  in-
telligence  open-source  framework  developed  by  the  Google  Brain 
team (Abadi et al., 2016). Although Tensorflow is one of the leading 
machine  learning  frameworks,  this  excludes  the  possibility  of 
employing different open-source machine learning systems such as 
PyTorch primarily developed by Facebook AI Research lab (FAIR)

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, based on the general usage of deep learning models, they are often used for tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. In the context of remote sensing and agriculture, deep learning models could potentially be used for crop type identification, yield estimation, disease detection, land cover mapping, among other applications. The context mentions TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning, capable of handling various types of neural networks and computations. It also mentions PyTorch, another widely used open-source machine learning library, known for its flexibility and ease of use. Both libraries support a wide range of deep learning architectures and applications.
