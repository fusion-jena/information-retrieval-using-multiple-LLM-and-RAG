ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

class,  the  sample  variance  led  to  an  R2  practically  always  above  0.4. 
Some slight reductions are observed only for very low values of L, which 
suggests  that  a  minimum  number  of  pixels  should  be  used  for  the 
computation of the sample variance. The maximum R2 obtained for this 
case is around 0.47 and is obtained for L = 425. Also the other metrics 
have a peak around L = 425: a progressive decrease is then observed. For 
large values of L, the R2 values reported in Fig. 12 are found. For values 
of L lower than 800, the NSL is the metric with the lowest R2 whereas, for 
larger values, it has a behaviour similar to that of the absolute deviation. 
When  the  “Other  Plants”  class  is  considered,  the  best  results  are 
obtained when considering the NSL. While it is difficult to determine the 
root cause of this effect, it is important to remind that only 33 points 
belong to this class. Thus, this result needs to be confirmed by consid-

Finally,  the  metric  developed  here  can  become  useful  in  various 
application contexts. Here we discuss four main potential applications of 
the proposed approach.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a validation loss plateau, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation set, or exceeding a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned from the data without overfitting or underfitting. Without additional context, it is not possible to specify which criteria were used in this particular study.
