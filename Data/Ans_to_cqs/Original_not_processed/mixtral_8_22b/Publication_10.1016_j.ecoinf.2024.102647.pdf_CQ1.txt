Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about data collection methods, some common ways to collect raw data include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can be conducted through various means such as online forms or interviews to gather information directly from individuals. Sensors can be deployed to measure physical quantities like temperature, pressure, or humidity, which can then be converted into digital signals for further processing. Public datasets refer to collections of data made publicly available by organizations or researchers, often for research purposes. These datasets may contain diverse types of information, including images, text, audio, or video files. In the field of groundwater studies, relevant data might come from sources such as water quality measurements, geological surveys, satellite imagery, or hydrological models. It should be noted that the choice of data collection method depends on factors such as the nature of the problem being studied, the availability of resources, and ethical considerations.
