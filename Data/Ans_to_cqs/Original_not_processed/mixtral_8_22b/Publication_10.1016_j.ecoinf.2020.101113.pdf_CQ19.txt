2.3.  Model training 

2.3.1.  Training data preprocessing 

The  CNN  model  used  in  this  study  requires  equally  sized  input 
images. We chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 s as it is near 
the mean and median template duration across target call types (Fig. 2). 
Most  call  types  have  a  duration  below  1  s,  and  for  those  above  2  s,

Our implementation only included the feature extraction layers of 
ResNet50,  excluding  the  remaining  layers  used  for  ImageNet  classifi-
cation,  referred  to  as  the  network  “top”.  The  network  top  consists  of 
fully  connected  (FC)  layers  for  learning  a  predictive  model  from  the 
input  features.  An  FC  layer  consists  of  a  set  of  nodes,  each  of  which 
takes  a  weighted  sum  of  the  input's  values  and  passes  it  through  a 
transfer function. The weights of an FC layer are learnable. In our case, 
we used two FC layers separated by a drop-out layer. The drop-out layer

learning, wherein a model already optimized for a similar dataset is re- 
trained with new data. We used a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the 
ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across

1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). Although ImageNet does not contain 
spectrograms,  models  pre-trained  with  the  dataset  learn  a  variety  of 
image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram clas-
sification  previously  (Lasseck,  2019;  Florentin  et  al.,  2020).  While 
previous  studies  have  found  optimal  performance  using  ensembles  of 
multiple CNN models (Kahl et al., 2017; Lasseck, 2019; Florentin et al., 
2020), in the interest of prediction efficiency and reasonable memory 
requirements, we chose to evaluate a single ResNet50 model.
