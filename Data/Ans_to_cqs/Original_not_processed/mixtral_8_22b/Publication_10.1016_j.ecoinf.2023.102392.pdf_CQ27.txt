2.2. Unmanned aerial vehicle data processing 

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data is processed using CATALYST 
PROFESSIONAL image processing software. The UAV data processing 
process is divided into six significant steps.  

i)  Camera parameter correction: this stage aids in identifying and 
correcting  image  distortions  caused  by  lens  curvature,  focal 
length, and perspective effects;  

ii)  Set up  connection points: A linked point is  a  spot that may  be 
visually recognized on overlapping areas between two or more 
images;  

iii)  Point fine-tuning: in this stage, the constraint points established 
in the previous step are improved to eliminate those with high 
error values (values more than 0.5) that were deleted from the 
computational model;  

iv)  Edit ground control points: Establish ground control points to edit 
the  dataset’s  georeferenced  to  the  WGS84/UTM  coordinate 
system;

inference system with ABC optimization technique to enhance the pre-
diction model’s performance. In a prior study conducted by Pham et al. 
(2023), the ACO-NFS model was utilized to estimate the extent of forest 
fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. However, the authors 
of that study solely focused on one specific type of forest cover without 
addressing  the  susceptibility  of  different  forest  types  to  wildfires. 
Considering these limitations, our experiment aims to integrate a hybrid 
model  for  predicting  forest  fires  vulnerability  with  a  deep  learning 
model-based approach for forests classification.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, there isn't enough detail to provide a precise answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can infer some general steps typically involved in deploying such models.

Model Serialization: After training, the deep learning model needs to be serialized or saved so it can be used later. This usually involves saving the model architecture and its learned parameters (weights and biases). Common formats include.h5 for Keras models,.pth for PyTorch models, and.pb for TensorFlow models.

Platform Selection: Once the model is serialized, it needs to be deployed onto a platform where it can receive input data and generate predictions. Depending on the application, this could range from a simple local server to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. For real-time applications, edge devices might also be considered.

However, without explicit details about the specific deep learning model mentioned in the papers, I cannot provide a detailed description of how exactly it was deployed.
