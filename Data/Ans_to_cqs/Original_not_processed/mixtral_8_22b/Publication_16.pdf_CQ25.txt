Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

While  a  limited  range  of  species  have  been  used  in  this 
study,  future  work  will  significantly  expand  the  number  of 
classes  in  the  model.  The  inclusion  of  additional  data  will 
enable us to compare the approach outlined in this paper with 
more  advanced  network  architectures  such  as  1D  CNNâ€™s.

By using a combination of both vision and acoustic based 
data  we  can  extend  the  reach  of  the  platform  into  habitats 
where  visual  monitoring  is  not  feasible.  By  studying  both 
image and acoustic data the system can analyse and provide a 
more holistic overview of the habitat.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies. 
A.  Data Collection and Description

Directly  relating  to  the  approach  posited  in  this  paper, 
several  deep  learning  approaches  have  been  reported  in  the 
literature  [16]  and  [17].  In  these  studies,  features  extracted 
from visual spectrogram representations of foreground species 
recordings were used to train CNNs and achieve 0.605 MAP 
in  BirdCLEF2017.  While  [10]  combined  hand-crafted 
features with deep learning in an attempt to classify fourteen 
different  bird  species  using  three  different  feature  types 
(acoustic features, visual features, and those generated using 
deep-learning). They reported that an F1-score equal to 95.95 
was possible when all three approaches were combined in an 
ensemble configuration.

The MLP is configured with a filter size of 2 and is used 
with Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as 
the optimiser. A dropout value of 50% has been used in the 
first  three  layers  to  improve  generalisation  and  reduce 
overfitting. The first three layers are composed of 256 nodes 
while the final layer is equal to the number of classes in our 
dataset. The model summary is shown in figure 5.

paper to train the model. 

The  performance  of  the  trained  model  is  measured  using

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification. The model is being developed to classify birds using both visual and acoustic data. The goal is to create a more comprehensive understanding of various habitats by combining image and audio analysis. The current version of the model uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture with backpropagation and the Adam optimizer. It aims to minimize overfitting through techniques like dropout regularization. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy. Future plans include expanding the number of classes in the model and comparing it to other advanced network architectures like 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
