available in Supplementary text S1). This methodology enhances pre-
dictive  accuracy  by  combining  forecasts  from  multiple  statistical 
models, mitigating the uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a 
single modelling method (Araújo and New, 2007; Hysen et al., 2022). 
Five  statistical  models  were  used  in  this  ensemble  framework, 
including  generalized  linear  models  (GLM),  maximum  entropy  (Max-
Ent),  random  forest  (RF),  generalized  boosting  model  (GBM),  and 
multivariate  adaptive  regression  lines  (MARS).  To  facilitate  model 
training, we employed a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points. 
Additionally, following Barbet-Massin et al. (2012), we generated 1000 
random  pseudo-absence  points  (five  times  the  number  of  occurrence 
points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points 
are crucial for model execution and provide a reference for areas that are 
unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

The ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging 
approach,  assigning  weights  to  individual  models  based  on  their  pre-
dictive  accuracy  on  the  test  data  (Thuiller,  2014).  Evaluation  and 
comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and 
the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under 
the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 
0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, 
and < 0.7 as poor (Eskildsen et al., 2013). Similarly, TSS values were 
categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4) 
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust 
understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of 

species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information can still be extracted regarding how the authors handled potential biases in their dataset.

In the context provided, the authors mentioned employing a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points to facilitate model training. While not explicitly stated, this approach could potentially help reduce any sampling bias present in the dataset. Additionally, they generated 1000 random pseudo-absence points (five times the number of occurrence points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points serve as a reference for areas unlikely to be inhabited by the target species, which might aid in addressing any spatial bias in the dataset.

Moreover, the authors utilized an ensemble modeling framework that combines forecasts from multiple statistical models. This approach helps enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a single modeling method. The five statistical models used in this ensemble framework include Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (Max-Ent), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). By integrating these different models, the authors aimed to improve overall model performance and minimize potential biases associated with each individual model.

Lastly, evaluation and comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and the ensemble model using Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) metrics. This comprehensive assessment allows for a better understanding of model performance and assists in making more reliable predictions about species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

While the context does not directly discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it highlights several strategies employed by the authors to handle potential biases in their dataset.
