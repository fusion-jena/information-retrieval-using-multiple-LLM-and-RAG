In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various 
fields  due  to  its  powerful  ability  to  handle  non-linear  relationships 
(Mohammadi et al., 2023), according to previous surveys, an increasing 
number of studies are attempting to use ML methods to estimate WQP. Li 
et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate 
Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data 
from 2017 to 2019; the results indicated that this model is suitable for 
lakes  with  medium  to  low  Chla  concentrations  (Li  et  al.,  2021). 
Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean 
Color  Network  (OGN)  to  estimate  Chla  concentrations  in  the  Barents 
Sea,  in  comparison  to  Gaussian  Process  Regression,  this  network 
demonstrated  a  5.2%  reduction  in  mean  absolute  error  (Asim  et  al., 
2021). Ensemble learning (EL) is one of the key technologies in the field

Researchers have developed numerous WQP inversion algorithms for 
different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), 
Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and 
more.  In  this  study,  the  development  of  these  algorithms  is  also 
considered. Moreover, deep learning algorithms were also considered, 
however,  the  limited  number  of  samples  was  not  conducive  to  deep 
learning, a point supported by the evidence in the research of Feng et al.

reliably estimate WQP in small and medium-sized lakes, and can provide 
guidance for obtaining WQP more accurately and reliably from remote 
sensing imagery for similar lakes.

4.3. Model performance 

All algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset, and five EL 
models were established for both the Chla concentration and turbidity: 
RF,  GBDT,  LightGBM,  XGBoost,  and  CatBoost.  Before  tuning  each 
model, we established a benchmark model with default parameters to 
evaluate  whether  parameter  adjustments  had  a  beneficial  impact  on 
model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was performed using 

both the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation methods, which 
were  implemented  using  GridSearchCV  from  Scikit-learn  and  the 
Hyperopt  library (version 0.2.7).  We selected the best  parameters  for 
each model and compared the results.
