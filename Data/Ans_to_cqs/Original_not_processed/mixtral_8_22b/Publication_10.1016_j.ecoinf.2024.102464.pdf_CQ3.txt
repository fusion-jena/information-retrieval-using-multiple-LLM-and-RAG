In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not directly address the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the researchers used some form of data labeling or annotation given they were able to extract Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from multiple machine learning models. These models likely required labeled data to train and evaluate their performance. Common data annotation techniques in deep learning include image classification, object detection (bounding boxes), semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without more specific details about the dataset and models used, it is impossible to determine which exact annotation technique was implemented in this case.
