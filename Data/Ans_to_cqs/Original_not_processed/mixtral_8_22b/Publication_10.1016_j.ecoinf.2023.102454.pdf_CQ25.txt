2.1.1. Study area 

Since  the  reform  and  opening  up,  Xi'an,  as  the  core  city  of  the 
Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration and a national central city, has 
been  experiencing rapid economic  development while  simultaneously 
driving  the  economic  development  of  Northwest  China  (Zhang  et  al., 
2022). Currently, Xi'an is repositioned as the core city of the “Belt and 
Road”, supporting the east and starting the west, connecting north and 
south. Xi'an is situated in the middle of the Guanzhong Plain, spanning 
45′N, as 
between longitude 107
illustrated in Fig. 2. As of 2021, the total area of Xi'an is 10,108 km2, 
encompassing  11  districts  and  two  counties.  The  city  has  a  resident 
population  of  12.952  million,  a  gross  domestic  product  of  1002.03 
billion yuan, and a population urbanization rate of 79.49%.

sumption and economic development. Additionally, due to the low ur-
banization  rate,  sparse  population,  and  lack  of  industries  in  the 
surrounding areas, future development processes should incubate and 
catalyse new industries and business forms with green, low-carbon, and 
eco-cycling as the growth points to enhance carbon sequestration. At the
