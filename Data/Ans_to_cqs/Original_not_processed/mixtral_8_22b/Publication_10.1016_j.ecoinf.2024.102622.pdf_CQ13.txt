and  verification  sets  in  a  ratio  of  3:1.  Five  modelling  methods  were 
selected: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple 
linear  regression  (MLR)  (Abdali  et  al.,  2023;  Fang  et  al.,  2024;  Khan 
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023b; Xiao et al., 2024). First, 
the model with the highest accuracy was selected to estimate the rice 
LCC and crop coverage degree in the entire study area without consid-
ering the differences in crop coverage. The rice LCC model based on crop 
coverage was then used for estimation, and its accuracy was compared 
with the chlorophyll estimation model without considering differences 
in crop coverage.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that five modeling methods were selected, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR). These methods have their own respective hyperparameters, such as learning rates, optimizers, and others, which can be adjusted during training to improve performance. For example, in the case of neural networks like MLP, common hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.). Unfortunately, the given context does not specify these values or any other hyperparameter settings for the mentioned models.
