Deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, are generally trained based on the prediction loss
minimization. Let x and y be the input images and corresponding output class labels, the objective of
the training is to iteratively minimize the average loss deﬁned as

J(w) =

N

N
∑
i=1

L( f (w; xi), yi) + λR(w)

This loss function measures how different is the output of the ﬁnal layer from the ground truth.
N is the number of data instances (mini-batch) in every iteration, L is the loss function, f is the
predicted output of the network depending on the current weights w, and R is the weight decay with
the Lagrange multiplier λ. It is worth mentioning that in the case of GoogLeNet, the losses of the

two auxiliary classiﬁers are weighted by 0.3 and added to the total loss of each training iteration.
The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights.

In this work, we considered the two most accurate CNNs, ResNet ([42]) and GoogLeNet ([43]).
ResNet won the ﬁrst place on the 2015 ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition
(ILSVRC)) and is currently the most accurate and deepest CNN available. It has 152 layers and
25.5 million parameters. Its main characteristic with respect to the previous CNNs is that ResNet
creates multiple paths through the network within each residual module. GoogLeNet won the ﬁrst
place of the 2014 ILSVRC. GoogLeNet is based on inception v3 and has 23.2 million parameters and
22 layers with learnable weights organized in four parts: (i) the initial segment, made up of three
convolutional layers, (ii) nine inception v3 modules, where each module is a set of convolutional and
pooling layers at different scales performed in parallel then concatenated together, (iii) two auxiliary
classiﬁers, where each classiﬁer is actually a smaller convolutional network put on the top of the

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning models mentioned, namely ResNet and GoogLeNet. The context only provides details about the architecture, performance, and characteristics of these models but does not discuss any implementation or deployment aspects related to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
