into four classes with different susceptibility classes, namely low, me-
dium,  high,  and  extreme,  using  Jenks'  natural  break  classification 
method  in  ArcGIS  10.6.  The  Jenks  Natural  Breaks  categorization  (or 
optimization) system is a data categorization methodology that aims to 
maximize  the  organization  of  a  given  set  of  values  into  distinct  and 
meaningful classes. A natural class refers to the class range considered 
the  most  ideal  and  is  observed  to  occur  “naturally”  within  a  given 
dataset. A class interval consists of elements exhibiting comparable at-
tributes, constituting an inherent grouping within a given dataset. The 
approach  employed  in  this  study  is  to  minimize  the  variance  within 
classes  while  simultaneously  maximizing  the  variance  across  types 
(Jenks, 1967; Liu and Duan, 2018). Numerous studies have employed 
natural break (Jenks) and quantile approaches to classify fire risk maps

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., train, test, validation sets). However, it mentions that three machine learning algorithms were employed to evaluate fire risk: Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests. These methods typically require splitting the available data into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation purposes. Common practices include randomly dividing the data into these subsets or employing techniques such as k-fold cross-validation. Without further details from the source material, I cannot provide more specific information regarding the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
