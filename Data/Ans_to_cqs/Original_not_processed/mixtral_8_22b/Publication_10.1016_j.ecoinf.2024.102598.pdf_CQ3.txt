Data availability

Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no specific mention of any data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. These methods are often applied to images, videos, or other forms of visual data to create labeled datasets for training machine learning models.
