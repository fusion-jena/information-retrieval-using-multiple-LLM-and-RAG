of random samples are automatically created in the study area with the 
constraint  that  the  selected  points  should  be  led  into  EGI  and  WCNV 
shapefiles. The samples are categorized into two classes named “citrus” 
and “non-citrus”. Note that these two class samples are made using EGI 
and  WNCY,  separately.  To  increase  the  accuracy  of  sample  selection, 
after the automatic selection is finished, the human operator checks the 
produced sample  feature collection. Specifically,  with the  aid  of GE’s 
images  (which  are  simultaneous  with  satellite  images),  the  selected 
samples are checked rapidly and if a sample is collected inappropriately, 
it will be deleted from the sample collection. Furthermore, to improve 
the robustness and confidence of sample selection, a variety of samples 
are  collected  manually  based  on  the  GEE  satellite  view.  The  first 
methodology is automatic while the last one is semi-automatic (auto-

ture,  some  studies  have  focused  exclusively  on  ecological  infor-
matics. In this regard, Albayrak et al. (2021) used Random Forest and 
Decision Tree algorithms, which are among the ensemble learning 
techniques, and estimated the behavior of migratory bees. Using the 
results of the modeling study, practical information has been given to 
the migratory beekeepers with thematic maps for the whole country. 
In a similar study, Ayadi et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive 
survey of resolution methods for constraint networks using static and 
dynamic  algorithms  and  showed  that  ecological  informatics  is  the 
most appropriate constraint satisfaction problem resolution method 
for  a  given  context.  In  another  study,  by  applying  remote  sensing

total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

method has its own pros and cons. The ability to collect large numbers of 
samples  in  a  very  short  time  is  one  of  the  major  advantages  of  this 
method. On the other hand, as its cons, we can mention that a few points 
may be collected incorrectly, and the human expert corrects them in the 
post-supervision step.

Helpful Answer:
The literature does not provide specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to the random seed value. However, it mentions that there are two main approaches for collecting samples: point-wise and polygon-based. These sampling strategies do not directly address handling randomness but rather focus on improving the quality and diversity of the dataset.

For instance, in the case of citrus and non-citrus classification, random samples are generated within the study area, constrained by EGI and WCNV shapefiles. These samples are then divided into two categories: 'citrus' and 'non-citrus'. After the initial automatic selection, a human operator verifies the chosen samples using Google Earth's images, ensuring their appropriateness. Additionally, manual samples are gathered based on the Google Earth Engine satellite view to enhance the robustness and confidence of the sample selection process.

Furthermore, the literature discusses various machine learning techniques applied in ecological informatics, such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, to estimate the behavior of migratory bees or determine the onset of grass aging. However, none of these studies specifically addresses managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline concerning the random seed value.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary focus lies in enhancing data collection and processing methods rather than addressing randomness in the deep learning pipeline due to random seed values.
