start, middle, or end of the sampling period), 3) data processing level
with related processing approaches (e.g. raw, translated/processed,
data originator QA/QC, project-level QA/QC), 4) references to the
measurement setting description (e.g., E-ﬁeld Log ﬁle)—this informa-
tion is essential because it links the data to additional metadata re-
ported in the separate templates described in Section 3.3 (see
Fig. 2)—, and 5) references to data ﬁle descriptions (Data Column
Description).

approaches because common and transparent processing approaches
facilitate comparability. An additional advantage of this ﬂexible ap-
proach is that data originators and consumers can assimilate data into
variety of databases. A key component of this ﬂexibility is achieved by
separating the data column description from the data ﬁle description so
that the data column description can be customized to the speciﬁc data
ﬁle.

temporal scales to answer a science question or to generate model in-
puts. Prior to synthesis, each observation must be quality checked,
processed (e.g., units transformed, gap-ﬁlled, erroneous data ﬂagged or
removed), and organized in standardized, comparable formats (e.g.,
variable names, units). An example of a synthesized data product is the
FLUXNET2015 dataset, which includes data collected at sites from a
network of single-locale, eddy covariance towers that monitor an eco-
system over many years (FLUXNET, 2016). In addition to ecosystem
and global scale datasets, earth system science requires syntheses of
individual-based measures like point observations of leaf carbohydrate
content, continuous tree sap ﬂow, and demography censuses (e.g.,
Walker et al., 2014). Physical measures, such as meteorological ob-
servations, measurements of soil water content, and 3D structural re-
presentations (e.g., LiDAR), are also needed (e.g., Hunter et al., 2015;
Powell et al., 2013).

A potential limitation to the framework is due to the eﬃcient re-
porting mechanism designed to make reporting easier for data origi-
nators. FRAMES does not specify data variable names, units, or formats,
which are required for database assimilation. Using FRAMES, reported
data can be translated into a standardized protocol for database as-
similation, as exempliﬁed by similar case of automation of sap ﬂow
processing by a data consumer. The outstanding questions are 1)
whether this reporting approach will ultimate result in improved
availability of data with accompanying high quality metadata, and 2)
what the tradeoﬀs are in terms of person-hours and who bears that
cost—the data originator or dedicated data team personnel. We prior-
itized reporting formats in FRAMES to maximize reporting eﬃciency
because although improving, the generally low quantity of shared data
