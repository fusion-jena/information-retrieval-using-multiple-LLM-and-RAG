Compared with ViT, CNN has stronger local information extraction 

ability.  In  particular,  the  residual  structure  of  ResNet  connects  the 
different network layers via shortcut, which not only preserves the input 
features  but  also  addresses  the  degradation  problem  of  the  deep 
network, thus mitigating issues such as vanishing or exploding gradi-
ents. The residual structure can help the network to learn the features in 
the input image better, thereby improving the classification effect of the 
network. 

Different classes of objects of the same species have high similarities. 
To better classify objects, CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae 
classification, based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into 
the residual structure of ResNet. The structure of the CA-Hybrid network 
is shown in Fig. 4.

tion and Transformer, effectively extracts richer semantic features (Xie 
et al., 2024). A network based on CNN and ViT modules classified mi-
croorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% (Dwivedi et al., 2024).

For a large amount of wildlife images captured by UAV, traditional 
manual  analysis  usually  has  high  labor  costs  and  is  very  time- 
consuming.  Therefore,  automating  UAV  image  analysis  can  greatly 
improve  the  efficiency  of  wildlife  monitoring.  Deep  learning  makes 
classification  (Çalıs¸kan,  2022;  Çalıs¸kan,  2023;  Chouhan  et  al.,  2020) 
more efficient. Deep learning also has achieved great success in auto-
mated  wildlife  monitoring  (Christin  et  al.,  2019;  Kellenberger  et  al., 
2017;  Liu  and  Qu,  2023;  Song  et  al.,  2024;  Wang  et  al.,  2022).  For 
instance, RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN networks are used to detect elk, 
roe  deer,  red  deer  and  wild  boar  (Vecvanags  et  al.,  2022).  YOLOv5 
network  is  used  to  detect  mugger  crocodiles  (Desai  et  al.,  2022)  and 
desert animals (Chen et al., 2023), which have yielded significant re-
sults. Those object detection methods can directly locate and identify

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific details about the deployment platform used for the deep learning models mentioned. It discusses various aspects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and their applications in wildlife monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, it does not mention any specific cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for deploying these deep learning models.
