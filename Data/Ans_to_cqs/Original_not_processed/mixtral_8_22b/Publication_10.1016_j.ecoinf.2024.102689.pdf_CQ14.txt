tanayak  et  al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  we  will  explore  knowledge 
distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.

As clearly evident in Table 3, the refined model, integrated with the 
VOS  algorithm,  outperforms  both  the  YOLOv5  and  YOLOv8  models 
across  all  evaluation  metrics,  encompassing  Box_loss,  Seg_loss,  Preci-
sion, Recall, Precision (M), Recall (M), mAP, and mAP (M).

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions a suite of improvements and optimizations but does not detail whether these include techniques such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
