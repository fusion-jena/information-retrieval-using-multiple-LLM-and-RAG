The  results  indicate  that  the  Cascade  RCNN  outperformed  other 
models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN 
model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. This is consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Section  3.1.  Although  12  epochs  were  a  typical 
number of training times, almost all models reached the maximum mAP 
when the number of epochs reached 10. Therefore, for bird recognition, 
not  all  models  are  better  with  more  training  times,  and  choosing 

appropriate  training  times  for  different  models  is  beneficial  to  save 
computing resources. Specifically, the Cascade RCNN model had almost 
no  increase  in  the  mAP  at  9  epochs,  and  the  Faster  CNN  model  also 
showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves 
continued to 12 epochs, suggesting they require more training data or a 
longer training schedule to perform better.

5. Conclusion 

In this study, we proposed a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 
wild bird species acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger 
and Leopard National Park. Based on this dataset, we employed 8 deep 
learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their per-
formance.  Our  results  indicate  that  deep  learning-based  approaches 
have the potential to detect wild birds in camera traps efficiently. By 
applying  these  approaches,  manual  processing  costs  can  be  reduced, 
enabling  more  efficient  monitoring  of  wildlife  populations  over  wide 
areas and over time. Our findings can help conservation practitioners 
choose  appropriate  models  for  their  detection  tasks,  as  well  as  offer 
insight  on  the  use  of  deep  learning-based  technologies  to  improve 
wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.

The data was represented by video clips of 
infrared cameras in the Northeast Tiger and 
Leopard National Park from 2014 to 2020. 
The image dataset contains images of 10 
distinct bird species found in Europe.

sizes  and  possess  camouflage  adaptations  to  blend  with  their  sur-
roundings. Thus,  deep  learning  identification of  wild  birds has  yet to 
reach  a  satisfactory  level,  and  such  imprecision  can  cause  a  waste  of 
labor when studying bird populations dynamic.

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models used for bird object detection. It focuses mainly on evaluating the performance of various deep learning algorithms based on a dataset containing images of wild bird species obtained through camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. To determine the best approach for deploying the trained models, one would need additional details regarding the chosen platform, hardware requirements, and any necessary preprocessing steps before applying the models to new datasets.
