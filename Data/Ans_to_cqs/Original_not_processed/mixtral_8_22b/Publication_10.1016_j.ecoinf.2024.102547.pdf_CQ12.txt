relationship between SSL descriptors (thickness, depth, density), treating them 
as observations of a real-valued spatial process.

In  this  study,  we  conducted  an  analysis  of  a  multifrequency  acoustics  dataset  acquired  from  scientific 
echosounders  in  the  West  African  water.  Our  objective  was  to  explore  the  spatial  arrangement  of  marine  or-
ganism aggregations. We investigated various attributes of these intricate biological entities, such as thickness, 
relative density, and depth, in relation to their surroundings. These environmental conditions were represented 
at a fine scale using a towed multiparameter system. This study is closely intertwined with two key domains: 
Fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis. Fisheries acoustics techniques facilitate the collection 
of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales, all 
without causing any disturbance. On the other hand, spatial-functional data analysis is a statistical approach for

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not mention the use of any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses the application of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Functional Geostatistical Spatio-Temporal Additive Models (FGSAMs). These are statistical models used for analyzing complex relationships between variables, including spatial and temporal dependencies. Therefore, based on the given context, no specific deep learning model can be identified as being used in the pipeline.
