As a 783,562 km2 land bridge, Türkiye serves as a major gene flow 
pathway between Europe, Asia, and Africa (S¸ ekercio˘glu et al., 2011a). 
Despite  being  almost  entirely  covered  by  three  biodiversity  hotspots 
(Caucasus, Irano-Anatolian, and Mediterranean), only a small fraction of 
Türkiye’s land area is protected (NCNP, Republic of Türkiye, Ministry of 
Agriculture and Forest, 2022). Moreover, many of these protected areas 
are inadequately safeguarded and face threats from deforestation, con-
struction,  mining,  and  other  violations  of  environmental  law  (Atmis¸, 
2018; S¸ ekercio˘glu et al., 2011a, 2011b). Türkiye’s forests, estimated at 
29%  of  its  land  area,  are  under  siege  from  various  human  activities, 
causing fragmentation and degradation (Birben, 2020). From 2001 to 
2020,  Türkiye  lost  545,000  ha  of  tree  cover,  a  5.4%  decrease  totally 
during  this period (Harris et  al., 2021). The economic significance  of

Türkiye’s forests, with export revenues nearing 16 billion US dollars in 
˙
2023 (T
IM, 2023), necessitates effective forest management but inad-
vertently  intensifies  habitat  fragmentation  and  public  access  via  road 
construction.
