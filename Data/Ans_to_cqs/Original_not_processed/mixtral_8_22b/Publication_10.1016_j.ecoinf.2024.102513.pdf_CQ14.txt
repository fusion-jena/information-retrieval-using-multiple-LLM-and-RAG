where  zi  is  the  output  value  of  the  i-th  neuron,  wj  is  the  convolution 
weight for input value xj, bi  is the bias, and f is the activation function. 
The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

Helpful Answer:
Hyperparameter optimization is crucial for improving the performance of machine learning models. In this study, the authors used two methods for hyperparameter optimization: Grid Search and Random Search.

Grid Search involves specifying a set of values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with every possible combination of those values. This method can be computationally expensive but ensures a thorough exploration of the parameter space.

Random Search, on the other hand, randomly samples a subset of hyperparameter combinations within specified ranges. This approach can often find good solutions faster than Grid Search since it does not exhaustively explore all possibilities. However, there is no guarantee that the best solution will be found.

In this research, both Grid Search and Random Search were employed to determine the optimal hyperparameters for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By comparing the results obtained using these two methods, the authors could identify the most effective hyperparameters for their specific application.

It should be noted that while Grid Search and Random Search are commonly used techniques for hyperparameter optimization, they may not always yield the best results. Other approaches such as Bayesian Optimization or Evolutionary Algorithms have also been proposed to address some limitations of traditional methods. Ultimately, selecting the appropriate technique depends on factors such as computational resources, time constraints, and problem complexity.
