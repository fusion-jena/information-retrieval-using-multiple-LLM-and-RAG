2.2. Acoustic monitoring 

We  deployed  an  acoustic  recorder  (Song  Meter  SM2  recorder, 
Wildlife  Acoustics)  at  each  site.  The  Song  Meters  were  active  from  8 
June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and programmed to record (.wav format) the 
first 15 min of each hour. The sampling rate was 48 kHz, with 16 bits per 
sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data 
and change batteries. A total of 32,023 15-min recordings (8006 h of 
recording) were collected (8044 at Station A, 8075 at Station B, 7782 at 
Station C, and 8122 at Station D).

Future  studies  that  aim  to  decrease  the  error  rate  of  algorithms 
developed  using  Kaleidoscope  may  create  advanced  recognizers  after 
manually labeling the events. Likewise, more research should evaluate 
the feasibility of using more sophisticated methods for automated cattle 
detection,  such  as  convolutional  neural  networks  or  deep  learning 

(Gupta et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Indeed, the development of 
supervised machine learning algorithms has already proven to be very 
effective for ungulate detection (Avots et al., 2022).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: In this study, the method used for collecting raw data is acoustic monitoring. An acoustic recorder called Song Meter SM2 recorder by Wildlife Acoustics was deployed at each site. These recorders were active from June 2015 to May 2016 and were set to record the first 15 minutes of every hour. The recordings were saved in.wav format with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 16 bits per sample resolution. The devices were regularly checked to download data and replace batteries. This resulted in a total of 32,023 15-minute recordings, amounting to approximately 8006 hours of recording across all sites.
