Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific details about which data augmentation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that all augmentation techniques were applied to increase training sample diversity. Common data augmentation techniques for images include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise. For time series data like EEG signals, common techniques include time shifting, magnitude warping, and frequency domain transformations. Without more information, we cannot determine exactly which techniques were employed in this case.
