3. Methodology 

3.1. Image processing 

GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform. Considerable quanti-
ties of geospatial data are publicly available on GEE, including a mul-
tipetabyte  catalog  of  satellite  imagery,  such  as  Landsat  imagery. 
Consequently, GEE facilitates rapid data access and parallel processing 
for analysis (Gorelick et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2018). The present 
study  utilized  the  GEE  platform  to  retrieve  atmospherically  corrected 
United  States  Geological  Survey  Landsat  Surface  reflectance  products

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The study utilizes the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline. GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform with considerable quantities of geospatial data publicly available. This includes a multipetabyte catalog of satellite imagery, such as Landsat imagery. The present study specifically uses GEE to retrieve atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products. These products are then used for further analysis and processing within the deep learning pipeline. No other specific methods or sources for collecting raw data are mentioned in the given context.
