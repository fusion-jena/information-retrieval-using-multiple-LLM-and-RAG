MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  this  section  the  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  presented 
along with the modelling approach taken and the evaluation 
metrics used to evaluate the trained model. The section also 
discusses data pre-processing using the Librosa library. Keras 
and TensorFlow 2.2 are utilised as the backend and an Nvidia 
2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory is utilised to accelerate 
model training. In addition, the proposed inferencing pipeline 
is discussed along with the associated technologies. 
A.  Data Collection and Description

Figure 8. Date Pre-processing Stages 

The  acquired  audio  files  are  transmitted  over  4G  using 
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. 
Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature extractor 
function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features 
for the classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged 
to the site for review.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this section the classification results are presented using 
the  evaluation  metrics  outlined  previously.  The  deployment 
and inferencing of the trained model in test environment are 
also presented to ascertain the effectiveness of the end-to-end 
pipeline. 
A.  Species Classification Performance

Directly  relating  to  the  approach  posited  in  this  paper, 
several  deep  learning  approaches  have  been  reported  in  the 
literature  [16]  and  [17].  In  these  studies,  features  extracted 
from visual spectrogram representations of foreground species 
recordings were used to train CNNs and achieve 0.605 MAP 
in  BirdCLEF2017.  While  [10]  combined  hand-crafted 
features with deep learning in an attempt to classify fourteen 
different  bird  species  using  three  different  feature  types 
(acoustic features, visual features, and those generated using 
deep-learning). They reported that an F1-score equal to 95.95 
was possible when all three approaches were combined in an 
ensemble configuration.

The  trained  model  is  hosted  using  TensorFlow  2.2  and 
served  through  a  public  facing  website  developed  by  the 
authors 2 .  CUDA  11  and  cuDNN  7.6.5  enables  the  GPU 
accelerated learning aspect of the pipeline. A Samsung S10 is 
used  to  record  garden  birds  and  automatically  upload  the 
acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP) for classification. Figure 6 shows the end-
to-end inferencing pipeline starting with the sensor and ending 
with the public facing conservationAI site as shown in Figure 
7.  Due  to  the  use  of  standard  protocols,  the  system  can 
interface  with  a  variety  of  sensors  for  real-time  inference. 
Where in field communication is unavailable, audio files can 
be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the audio files are segmented into 15-second windows and each window is passed to a feature extraction function which uses Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to extract features for the classifier. It does not provide any details about whether or how data augmentation was performed on the input data before passing it to the feature extraction function. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context alone.
