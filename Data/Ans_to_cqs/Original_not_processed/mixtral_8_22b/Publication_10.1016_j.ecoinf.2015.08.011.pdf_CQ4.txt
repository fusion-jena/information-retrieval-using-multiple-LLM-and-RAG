For the purpose of prediction, the most important property of a
model is its competence to generalize. While generalization compe-
tence indicates a model's power to perform well on data that were not
used to train it, overﬁtting prevents model generalization in the face
of new situations (Schlink et al., 2003). To avoid overﬁtting, early stop-
ping the most frequently used regularization technique was employed.
In order to apply it, the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for
model training (to compute the gradient and updating of the network
parameters, such as weights and biases—the training set) and 20% for
model testing (to test the model error validation—the validation set).
The model weights were randomly initialized and the training process
was stopped when the network began to overﬁt the data, i.e., the
error on the validation set.

To develop a robust ANN, we have to consider the selection of the
number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learn-
ing rates, and the number of epochs for model training carefully. For ex-
ample, if we consider an insufﬁcient number of neurons in the hidden
layer, then the ANN cannot reﬂect nonlinearity within the training
data. Conversely, if we consider too many neurons, then the ANN has
an overﬁtting problem, and hence, this leads a lack of generalizability.
In this study, we applied a trial-and-error method, which is known to
be the best method to determine the appropriate number of neurons
and learning rate (Shamseldin, 1997; Hill and Minsker, 2010), and an
early stopping technique to hinder overﬁtting.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling mentioned in the given context. However, I can provide some general insights regarding data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to existing images, thereby creating new ones. It helps prevent overfitting and improves the performance of machine learning models. Some popular data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to create new variations. This works particularly well with datasets containing objects that do not have a preferred orientation, such as animals or plants.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by various angles to generate different versions. This is useful for improving the model's ability to recognize objects from multiple perspectives.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to simulate objects appearing closer or farther away. This helps the model better understand scale invariance.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along the x and y axes to mimic small movements of the object within the image frame.

5. Shearing: Applying shear transformation to images creates distorted versions, helping the model become more resistant to perspective distortions.

6. Noise injection: Adding random noise to pixel values can help improve the model's robustness against noisy input data.

These techniques can be combined and applied simultaneously during the training phase to further enhance the diversity of the dataset.
