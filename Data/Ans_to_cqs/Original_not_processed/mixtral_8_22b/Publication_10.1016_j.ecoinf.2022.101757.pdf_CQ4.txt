the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.
