2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

models were trained and tested on training and testing datasets. Later, 
performances of the model were conducted for both phases.

methodology  of  Uddin et  al.  (2022a),  to evaluate the  performance of 
various  ML  algorithms.  Details  of  the  methodology  can  be  found  in 
referred material. This approach is widely used in modelling tasks like 
water  resource  management,  waste  management,  natural  hazard  pre-
diction, and environmental modelling (Gidey, 2018; Pham et al., 2020; 
Vu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021). It offers high precision by utilizing ten 
subsets of the original dataset for both training and testing (Sajib et al.,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the size of minority class samples while undersampling reduces the size of majority class samples. Diverse data collection aims to collect more representative data from different sources to reduce bias.

These techniques help improve the accuracy and fairness of machine learning models by reducing overfitting, underfitting, and biased predictions caused by imbalanced datasets. However, it is important to note that no single technique can completely eliminate data bias, and multiple approaches may need to be combined to achieve optimal results.
