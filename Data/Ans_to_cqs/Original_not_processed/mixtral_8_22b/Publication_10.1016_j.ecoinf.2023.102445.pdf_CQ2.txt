Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

neural  network  (CNN).  It  encapsulates  three  operations,  Conv2d 
convolution,  BatchNorm2d  and  an  activation  function,  which  can 
effectively extract and learn useful feature information from the input 
data and provide more expressive input for the subsequent layers of the 
neural network. The C2f module is used for multilevel deep processing 
and abstraction of input features to construct the backbone network of 
CSPDarknet53 (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020), and its design is inspired by 
the  C3  module  and  Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (ELAN)  to 
realize additional cross-layer connections across branches. This design

Y(i, j, c_out) represents the calculation result at position (i, j), the 
output channel c_out in the output feature map, X is the input image, the 
size of H_in × W_in × c_in, Y is the output image, and the size of H_out ×
W_out × c_out. Conv2d is a 2D convolution operation performed based 
on  the  input  X,  output  Y,  kernel  k,  step  size  s,  and  group  setting. 
BatchNorm2d  represents  the  batch  normalization  operation,  which  is 
used to normalize the convolution output and improve training stability. 
Then, the chunk is partitioned vertically and divided into two parts 
along the channel dimension. For the two branches, the size obtained is

H × W × C/2. First, Conv is applied to halve the number of channels, the 
feature size becomes H × W × C/4, and the calculation formulas are 
shown in Formula (3) and Formula (4). 

cv11(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

cv21(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

2.1.1. Experimental equipment and environment 

In  this  paper,  all  the  experiments  are  conducted  on  a  consistent 
experimental  platform.  The  platform  uses  an  AMD  Ryzen  7  5800H 
processor with a Radeon graphics operating at 3.20 GHz. The graphics 
card is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4 GB of video 
memory.  The  development  environment  consists  of  the  Windows  10 
Enterprise operating system. The software environment included Python 
version 3.7, CUDA version 11.6 and PyTorch deep learning framework 
version 1.12.0.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the neural network being discussed involves a 2D convolution operation (Conv2d) performed on the input X, which suggests that the input data could be in the form of images or videos. Additionally, the use of a 2D convolution operation further supports the idea that the input data might be visual data such as images or frames extracted from videos. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline described in the context likely utilizes image or video data formats.
