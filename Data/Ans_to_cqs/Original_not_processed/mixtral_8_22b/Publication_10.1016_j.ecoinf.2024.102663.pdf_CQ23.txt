1. Introduction 

Fish biomass estimation is essential for the fisheries and aquaculture 
industries  (Li  et  al.,  2020).  Manual  methods  of  estimation  can  be 
strenuous for the fish. Thus, there is a need for non-intrusive methods of 
fish  biomass  estimation.  Biomass  estimation  in  a  turbid  environment 
also comes with several challenges. This is where deep learning can play 
a  vital  role.  Training  a  deep  learning  model  on  large  datasets  of  fish 
images  can  provide  accurate  biomass  estimates  without  causing  un-
necessary  strain  to  the  fish  and  minimizes  manual  effort.  Hence,  the 
motivation of this research lies in providing an efficient, precise, and 
cost-effective  method  for  estimating  fish  biomass  in  turbid  environ-
ments. The reliance on fishing and aquaculture is a prominent charac-
teristic of numerous societies, playing a substantial role in bolstering the 

economic and social vitality of various nations and locations.

Helpful Answer:
The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did use a diverse dataset consisting of images of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT), which had varying weights ranging from 10-126 grams. They also employed different image resolutions (1920p x 1080p) and utilized a total of 915 images for training purposes. Additionally, they applied various preprocessing techniques such as white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE to enhance the quality of the input data. These factors contribute towards improving the robustness and adaptability of the model across different scenarios. Nevertheless, it would have been more informative if the authors had discussed using other common practices like cross-validation or stratified sampling to further validate the performance of their model.
