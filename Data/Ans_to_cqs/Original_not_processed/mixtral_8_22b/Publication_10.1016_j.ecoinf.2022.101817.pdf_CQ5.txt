Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The only dataset explicitly mentioned in the given context is the ImageNet dataset. This dataset was used to evaluate the VGG16 (OxfordNet) CNN architecture, which was chosen for its strong performance on this particular dataset. No other datasets are directly referenced or discussed in relation to the deep learning pipeline.
