The root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is uti-
lized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ,

To simultaneously carry out shrinkage estimation and variable se-
lection,  we  employ  the  penalized  loss  function  with  an  L1  penalty 
(Tibshirani, 1996), defined as follows:

where lΞ  is the loss function minimized by solving the estimating eqs. (2)

and (3), and is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A. We set ϕ0
ϕ (k ∕= 0, ϕ ≥ 0) as a constant tuning parameter. The loss function has no 
penalties for the intercept parameter β0 of the intensity function and the 
coefficient  paramter  α  for  the  detection  probability  model.  We  can 
compute the L1  penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method 
(Goeman,  2010).  The  detailed  computation  algorithm  is  provided  in 
Appendix C.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the study does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the authors focus on employing a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for simultaneous shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This approach involves setting a constant tuning parameter and computing the L1 penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method. Therefore, based solely on the information available, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model, if any, was utilized in this particular study.
