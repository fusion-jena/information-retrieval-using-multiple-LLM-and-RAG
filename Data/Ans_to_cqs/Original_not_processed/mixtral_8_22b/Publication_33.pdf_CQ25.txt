to calibrate Deep Learning models using a single parameter for all  classes35. This parameter is used, instead of 
the traditional softmax function, to convert the vector output from the neural network into a real probability.

Building  the  convolutional  neural  network.  Convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  belong  to  the 
class  of  DLAs.  For  the  case  of  species  identification,  the  training  phase  is  supervised,  which  means  that  the 
classes  to  identify  are  pre-defined  by  human  experts  while  the  parameters  of  the  classifier  are  automatically 
optimized  in  order  to  accurately  classify  a  “training”   database24.  CNNs  are  composed  of  neurons,  which  are 
organized in layers. Each neuron of a layer computes an operation on the input data and transfers the extracted 
information to the neurons of the next layer. The specificity of CNNs is to build a descriptor for the input image 
data and the classifier at the same time, ensuring they are both optimized for each  other42. The neurons extract-
ing the characteristics from the input data in order to build the descriptors are called convolutional neurons, as

Whatever the goal, our framework is highly flexible and can be adapted by tuning the species thresholds 
regulating the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage in an attempt to monitor biodiversity 
through big datasets where species are unidentified. To unclog the bottleneck of information extraction about 
organism forms, behaviors and sounds from massive digital data, machine learning algorithms, and particularly 
the last generation of deep learning algorithms, offer immense promises. Here we propose to help the users to 
control their error rates in ecology. This is a valuable addition to the ecologist’s toolkit towards a routine and 
robust analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors. With this control of error 
rate in the hands of users, Deep Learning Algorithms can be used for real applications, with acceptable and

training datasets.

•  In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a CNN on a given database T0 (Fig. 2a)
•  Then, the second phase consists of tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e. each species in our 

case), noted i, with i ∈ {1, ..., n} , using a second and independent database noted T1 (Fig. 2b).

In terms of classification, it means we transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) in 3 options 

(Fig. 3) by applying Eqs. (15, 16).

Computing the confidence thresholds.  After the phase 1 (model training phase), for an image X of the 
threshold tuning dataset processed by the classifier, we obtain an output {C(X), S(X)} , where C(X) is the class 
(i.e. species, belonging to the trained set of species) with the highest classification score S(X). For this image, we 
know the ground truth Y in {1, .., n} belonging to the same set of species classes.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify different species based on pre-defined classes established by human experts. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which belongs to the class of deep learning algorithms (DLAs). During the training phase, the parameters of the classifier are automatically optimized to accurately classify a "training" database. The model is then fine-tuned using a second and independent database to adjust a risk threshold specific to each class (i.e., each species). The ultimate goal of this deep learning model is to aid in monitoring biodiversity through large datasets containing unidentified species, providing ecologists with a powerful tool for analyzing big data and conducting real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors.
