They employ supervised classification systems using training datasets to 
minimize  classification  errors  that  could  otherwise  be  caused  by  the 
internal structure of the algorithms (Bousquet et al., 2004; Hastie et al., 
2009). As a result, ML algorithms can be used to improve classification 
performance without needing to articulate the underlying mechanisms 
and assumptions of traditional statistical models (Clarke, 2013; Hastie 
et al., 2009). They can therefore, be trained using both balanced datasets 
(with the same amount or number of pixels sampled for each LULC) and 
imbalanced datasets (with different amount or number of pixels sampled 
for each LULC class) without major classification uncertainties. Here, we 
focus on four ML algorithms, kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF, which have been 
shown to be well suited to LULC classification and to outperform other 
algorithms such as MLC and DT (Khatami and Mountrakis, 2016; Noi

dictors, and equally centered and scaled the predictor variables in order 
to reduce sampling bias.

2.3.2.4. RF: random forest classification. With the RF approach, we used 
the “randomForest” package. We allowed the model to set the number of 
trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) by default so as 
to ensure satisfactory model performance (Duro et al., 2012; Matlhodi 
et al., 2019; Zhang and Roy, 2017). i.e. about 500 decision trees were 
created  by  the  model  under  default  settings,  with  over  3000  training 
samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do state that they "equally centered and scaled the predictor variables" in order to reduce sampling bias. This suggests that some form of normalization was applied to the dataset before it was fed into the machine learning algorithms. Normalization is a common technique used to prevent certain features from dominating others due to differences in scales, which can lead to biased results. Other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are also commonly used to address data bias but are not specifically mentioned in this study.
