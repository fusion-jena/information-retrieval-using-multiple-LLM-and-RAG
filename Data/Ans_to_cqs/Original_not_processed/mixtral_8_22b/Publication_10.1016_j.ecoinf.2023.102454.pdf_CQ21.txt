2.1.1. Study area 

Since  the  reform  and  opening  up,  Xi'an,  as  the  core  city  of  the 
Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration and a national central city, has 
been  experiencing rapid economic  development while  simultaneously 
driving  the  economic  development  of  Northwest  China  (Zhang  et  al., 
2022). Currently, Xi'an is repositioned as the core city of the “Belt and 
Road”, supporting the east and starting the west, connecting north and 
south. Xi'an is situated in the middle of the Guanzhong Plain, spanning 
45′N, as 
between longitude 107
illustrated in Fig. 2. As of 2021, the total area of Xi'an is 10,108 km2, 
encompassing  11  districts  and  two  counties.  The  city  has  a  resident 
population  of  12.952  million,  a  gross  domestic  product  of  1002.03 
billion yuan, and a population urbanization rate of 79.49%.

Helpful Answer:
After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These may include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. This can provide insights into how the model makes decisions and identify any potential biases or weaknesses. To create a saliency map, one could use techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights areas of the image that contribute significantly to the final prediction.

Calculating various performance metrics allows us to quantitatively assess the model's accuracy and efficiency. Commonly used metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall indicates the fraction of relevant instances that were correctly identified. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced evaluation. Lastly, the AUC represents the degree of separability between classes, with higher values indicating better classification performance.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating the model's performance. It provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem, displaying the number of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each class. By examining the confusion matrix, we can determine where the model tends to make mistakes and identify patterns in its errors.

In conclusion, postprocessing steps like generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and constructing confusion matrices play crucial roles in understanding and improving machine learning models. They offer valuable insights into the decision-making processes of these models and enable researchers to fine-tune them accordingly.
