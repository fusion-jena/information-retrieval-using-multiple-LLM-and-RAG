Helpful Answer:
Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance on unseen data. There are several regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, including:

1. Dropout: Dropout is a popular regularization method used in neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptations between neurons and reduces overfitting. The idea behind dropout is to create a sparse network where only a subset of neurons is active during each iteration of training.
2. L2 Regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of all weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights and prevents any single weight from becoming too large, reducing overfitting.
3. Early Stopping: Early stopping is a form of regularization that involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping when it starts to increase. This helps to prevent overfitting by not allowing the model to continue training beyond the point where it begins to fit noise rather than signal.
4. Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is a technique used to stabilize the distribution of inputs to each layer in a neural network. By normalizing the input to each layer, batch normalization can help to reduce overfitting and improve the speed and stability of training.
5. Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations such as rotations, translations, and flips. This helps to prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data and encouraging the model to learn more robust features.
