2.2.3. Other data 

The land use/cover dataset for China featured a spatial resolution of 
1 km × 1 km and was acquired from RESDC. The dataset encompasses 
land use/cover information spanning the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. It covers six major land use/cover cate-
gories and twenty-six subcategories. Through a combination of manual 
and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, the primary 
land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the 
secondary  land  use/cover  categories  had  an  accuracy  exceeding  90% 
(Ning et al., 2018). In our research, the reclassified land use/cover types 
were categorized into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, 
construction land, water area, and unused land. The boundary datasets 
for  ecological  engineering  are  sourced  from  the  National  Ecological 
Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/).

development. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered significant regional 
variations  in  the  impacts  of  identical  land  use  conversion  types.  For 
instance, the Grassland to Grassland (G-G) conversion had a contribu-
tion of 46.17% in the Continental Basin (CN), whereas it was only 4.11% 
in  the  Southeast  Basin  (SE).  These  discrepancies  may  reflect  regional 
variations  in  land  management  practices  and  the  provisioning  of 
ecosystem services.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study uses various datasets related to land use/cover, climate change, and human activities. Given this, it is likely that the data formats used could include geospatial data such as raster images or vector files, time series data like CSV files, or other relevant formats depending on the nature of the input data required by the deep learning models employed in the study.

Final Answer:
It is not explicitly stated what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, possible data formats might include geospatial data such as raster images or vector files, time series data like CSV files, or other relevant formats depending on the nature of the input data required by the deep learning models employed in the study.
