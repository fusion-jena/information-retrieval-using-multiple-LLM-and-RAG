To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

considering L < 500.

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that they utilize LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) images, which is a dataset collected through a survey conducted by EUROSTAT. Additionally, they also use North looking images from 2018 with land cover classifications such as croplands and grasslands. They do not provide any further information about how these images were obtained or if any additional sensors were used in the collection process. Therefore, based on the given context, it appears that the authors primarily rely on publicly available datasets like LUCAS and possibly satellite imagery for their raw data needs.
