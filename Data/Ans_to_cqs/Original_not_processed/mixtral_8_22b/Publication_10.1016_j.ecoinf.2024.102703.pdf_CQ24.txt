Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

Based on the Trophic State Index, which ranges from 31 to 67, all 

Fn(355) values ranged from 1.16 to 2.97, with the average increasing

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using a fixed random seed value across multiple runs or experiments. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure reproducibility and consistency in their results. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different random seeds and then averaging the outcomes to reduce the effect of randomness. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can help mitigate the impact of randomness by providing more robust estimates of performance metrics. Lastly, some libraries offer deterministic algorithms that do not rely on random number generation, ensuring consistent results regardless of the seed value.
