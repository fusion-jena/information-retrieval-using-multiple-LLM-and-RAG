2.5. Automated machine learning (AutoML) 

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed. 

2.5.1. AutoGluon

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  model’s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

tuning dataset is excluded from the training process. The model is then 
developed using the remaining dataset (i.e. the training dataset), and its 
performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average perfor-
mance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the 
performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyper-
parameters (Velasco Hererra et al., 2022). For this study, a value of 5 is 
assumed  for  k.  Grid  search  is  employed  to  evaluate  the  data-driven 
model’s  performance  using  each  combination  of  predefined  hyper-
parameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth 
of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning 
rate (which shows how fast the model learns) are tuned in this study as 
the influential hyperparameters (Cakiroglu et al., 2022).

The results showed the issue of overfitting in ML modelling, namely 
when the learning dataset used is relatively small. Some recent studies 
have  evaluated  model  performance  against  the  data  used  in  model 
fitting  and  tuning  (e.g.  Kucuk  and  Sevinc  (2023).  This  may  fail  to 
identify the true fit and behaviour of ML models, because ML models aim 
to  maximize  accuracy  against  the  model  development  (training  and 
tuning) dataset. Our model evaluation against an independent dataset 
revealed  true  model  fit,  which  in  our  case  was  10%  lower  than  that 
obtained against the model development dataset) in the best performing 
models and about 30% lower in the worst performing ones. Analysis of 
model behaviour also showed flawed behaviour in some models, such as 
non-monotonic trends that result from overfitting. The overfitting (i.e. 
where the model captures not only the trend but also the noise in the

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, there isn't explicit information regarding the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model being used, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, we do know that the study employs two AutoML models, AutoGluon and TabPFN, with the goal of improving model accuracy and enhancing prediction performance through optimal hyperparameter selection.

Hyperparameters play a crucial role in optimizing the learning process of data-driven models. By employing methods like k-fold cross-validation and grid search, researchers can fine-tune their models by selecting the most effective hyperparameters. In this particular study, the influential hyperparameters being adjusted include the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate.

While the exact purpose of the deep learning model remains unclear based on the provided context, it is evident that the primary objective is to improve overall model performance and achieve better predictions. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of addressing issues like overfitting when working with smaller datasets, emphasizing the significance of evaluating model performance against an independent dataset rather than relying solely on the model development dataset.
