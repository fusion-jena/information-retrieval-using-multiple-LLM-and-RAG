Table 1 
Our  model  design  follows  the  Wide  ResNet  approach  by  Zagoruyko  and 
Komodakis and consists of 157 layers, of which 36 are weighted.

eBird users (often experts from the lab) at certain hotspots throughout 
the  area.  We  pooled  the  data  from  four  point  count  locations  in  the 
proximity of the microphone (~300 m radius) and compared our de-
tections with the occurrence frequency on eBird checklist data.

collections provide a vast amount of open data on bird vocalizations. 
These recordings are typically obtained using (semi-) professional gear 
(handheld  directional  microphones)  and  are  characterized  by  a  high 
SNR.  These  so-called  ‘focal’  recordings  often  contain  only  a  single, 
clearly audible bird species and no overlapping vocalizations. However, 
it should be noted that the domain shift from focal to soundscape data 
presents  a  significant  challenge.  A  well-performing  model  trained  on 
focal  recordings  might not  perform  well  when applied  to  much  more 
complex soundscape recordings.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search for optimization.
