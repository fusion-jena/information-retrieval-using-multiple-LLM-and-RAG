Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, and LSTM can significantly 
enhance the accuracy of crop yield forecasts.

This research underscores the significant impact of machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the oil palm sector, offering a 
path to precise yield predictions and sustainable crop management. It 
highlights the utility of these models in enhancing agricultural practices 
by considering soil composition, climate variations, and farming tech-
niques, thus aligning production with market demands and optimizing 
the supply chain. Agronomists are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive 
approach leveraging ML and DL for research and development. At the 
same  time,  farmers  can  benefit  from  data-driven  insights,  mainly 
through  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor  model,  to  improve  planning  and 
resource  management.  Additionally,  the  findings  serve  as  a  basis  for 
stakeholders,  including  policymakers  and  the  agribusiness  sector,  to 
support ML integration in agriculture, fostering operational efficiency,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as dealing with random seed values. However, some common strategies used in general include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to prevent overfitting due to randomness. These strategies help maintain consistency and robustness in deep learning models despite inherent randomness.
