The  initial  version  of  the  BA  algorithm  implemented  in  FIREMAP 
involves  a  supervised  ML  classification  to  procure  a  BA  vector  of  the 
region of interest defined by the user. A data-mining approach using a 
large predefined training dataset (e.g. Gaveau et al., 2021; Ramo et al., 
2018)  is  adopted,  following  a  mono-temporal  perspective  relying  on 
atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 
A scenes (COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED dataset in GEE from 2018 
onwards). First, we considered in this initial version the exclusive use of 
post-fire scenes to (i) minimize commission errors associated with land 
cover changes such as logging, harvesting or flooding in the post-fire 
period  (assuming  those  associated  with  shadows  and  water  bodies) 
(Chuvieco et al., 2019), and (ii) maximize the synergistic potential of S2 
near-infrared  (NIR),  short-wave  infrared  (SWIR),  and  red-edge  (RE)

Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. In bounding box annotation, objects within images are identified and labeled with rectangular boxes. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class, while instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image.
