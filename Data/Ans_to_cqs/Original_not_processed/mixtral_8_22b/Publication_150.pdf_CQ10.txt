information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131 
was designed to be faster for mobile devices and thus has the fewest layers of the models compared here. The

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact code repository link based solely on the provided context. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for this information.
