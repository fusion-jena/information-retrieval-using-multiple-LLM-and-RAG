DATA ACC ESSI BILITY

GPS	track	data	used	in	the	analysis	are	available	at	(http://seabirdtrack-

ing.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950).	Other	data		used	

within	 the	 analysis	 (GPS	 &	 dive	 data,	 and	 associated	 matrices	 used

individuals	by	training	deep	learning	models	to	predict	diving	in	European	shags,	

common	guillemots	and	razorbills.	We	validate	our	predictions	using	withheld	data,	

producing	 quantitative	 assessment	 of	 predictive	 accuracy.	 The	 variables	 used	 to	

Handling	Editor:	Jana	McPherson

train	these	models	are	those	recorded	solely	by	the	GPS	device:	variation	in	longi-

tude	and	latitude,	altitude	and	coverage	ratio	(proportion	of	possible	fixes	acquired	

within	a	set	window	of	time).

3.	 Different	combinations	of	these	variables	were	used	to	explore	the	qualities	of	differ-

ent	models,	with	the	optimum	models	for	all	species	predicting	non-diving	and	diving	

behaviour	correctly	over	94%	and	80%	of	the	time,	respectively.	We	also	demonstrate	

the	superior	predictive	ability	of	these	supervised	deep	learning	models	over	other	

commonly	used	behavioural	prediction	methods	such	as	hidden	Markov	models.

Helpful Answer:
The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is available at <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t7ck5>. However, please note that the GPS dive data are under a one-year embargo. For more information, contact the corresponding authors Ella Browning or Robin Freeman.
