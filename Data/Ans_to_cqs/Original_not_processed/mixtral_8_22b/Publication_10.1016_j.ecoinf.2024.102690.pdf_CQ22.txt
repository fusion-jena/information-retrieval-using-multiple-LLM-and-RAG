5. Discussion 

5.1. The multi-scenario setting helps construct spatially balanced ESPs

Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

species inhabiting the PRD, was used as the reference. The maximum 
migration distance of this species was used to determine the maximum 
corridor  length,  whereas  the  wetland  resistance  value  was  used  to

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the ideal number of bundles was established by calculating the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI). Additionally, hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*) was used to analyze the spatial clustering of ESV and consider hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources. Therefore, these indices could be considered as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model used in this study.
