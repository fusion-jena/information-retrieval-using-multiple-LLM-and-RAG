mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

the  full  dataset  into  k  approximately  equally-sized  disjoint  subsets  or 
folds, where repeatedly (i.e. k times) the model is calibrated on k-1 folds, 
whilst the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. The 
overall  cross-validation  accuracy  is  estimated  by  aggregating  the 
(squared)  residuals  over  the  k  folds.  In  conventional  k-fold  cross- 
validation, the folds are chosen randomly.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model but discusses the general approach to ensuring the generalizability of a model when data availability is limited. One commonly used technique mentioned is k-fold cross-validation, which involves dividing the full dataset into 'k' approximately equal-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The model is then trained on 'k-1' folds, while the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the squared residuals over the 'k' folds. In conventional k-fold cross-validation, the folds are chosen randomly. However, it should be noted that the text also mentions that confidence intervals from k-fold cross-validation remain a largely unsolved problem requiring further research.
