D. Model Training

Feature Extraction: The hardware to train the model included
a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz
of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-
bit system. The software tools included Annaconda3 Jupyter
Notebook with Python 3.8, where the Tensorﬂow, OpenCV-
python3 [37] and Keras [38] libraries were used. The dataset
was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789
images and a test set of 1930 images. To obtain the pre-
trained weight parameters, we built the base models from the
MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small

optimizer (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum
of 0.9. All models were trained on a training set within 10
and 100 epochs (iterations).
Fine-Tuning: We un-froze the base models and trained the
weights of the top layers of these models along with the
classiﬁer layer added in the previous step. The models were
trained in 10 iterations to force the weights to be tuned from
generic feature maps to feature associated with the leaf dataset.
For a fair comparison, both V2 and V3 models were trained
with the same dataset and training parameters, i.e. 235,704.
The models were ﬁne-tuned and re-evaluated. The models
were saved in the machine with all the class labels.

models, pre-trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes. First,
the intermediate layer of all the models was selected to use
for feature extraction. For this purpose, the output of the last
layer (bottleneck layer) is commonly used prior to the ﬂatten
operation. The reason is that all the fully connected layers
are specialized to the task network was trained on; thus, the
features learned by these layers will not be useful for the new
task. The bottleneck features are more generic. Therefore, the
base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the
ImageNet dataset and used as a feature extractor. We added
a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce the
overﬁtting of the model. Finally, the top classiﬁer softmax
layer was added for predicting the class for an input image.
The model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled
and optimized with Adam optimizer. The other with the base
model of MobileNetV3 were optimized with Gradient descent

of the model was reduced to 60%, trainable parameters were
declined to 188,600 and training, and validation accuracies
were between 92%-94% and 82%-86%, respectively.

Helpful Answer:

To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed two strategies: tracking training and validation accuracy. They utilized graphs to visualize the progression of these metrics over time. Specifically, they plotted the training and validation accuracy of their transfer learned models based on MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 architectures (as shown in Fig. 2). Similarly, they tracked the training and validation accuracy of their fine-tuned models based on the same architectures (as depicted in Fig. 3). By observing these graphs, one can assess how well the models are performing and whether they are improving or deteriorating over time. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about adjusting hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or even stopping the training process if necessary.
