ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

inventory of species is the ‘Reserva Biológica do Jaru’, which is a part of the same forest patch but
not included in the GeoEye-1 images. The list of species encountered in the reserve can be found

Abstract: Mapping plant species at the regional scale to provide information for ecologists and forest
managers is a challenge for the remote sensing community. Here, we use a deep learning algorithm
called U-net and very high-resolution multispectral images (0.5 m) from GeoEye satellite to identify,
3000 km2 of Amazonian forest. The map was used to analyse
segment and map canopy palms over
the spatial distribution of canopy palm trees and its relation to human disturbance and edaphic
conditions. The overall accuracy of the map was 95.5% and the F1-score was 0.7. Canopy palm trees
covered 6.4% of the forest canopy and were distributed in more than two million patches that can
represent one or more individuals. The density of canopy palms is affected by human disturbance.
The post-disturbance density in secondary forests seems to be related to the type of disturbance,
being higher in abandoned pasture areas and lower in forests that have been cut once and abandoned.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It would require additional information or resources to determine the location of the data repository.
