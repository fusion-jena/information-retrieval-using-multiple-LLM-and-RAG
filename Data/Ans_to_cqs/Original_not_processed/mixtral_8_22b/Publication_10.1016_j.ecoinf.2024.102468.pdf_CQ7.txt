WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Sequel to training the two HMMs independently, HMM1 and HMM2 
are combined to form an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture 
weights. One of the HMMs is represented by the first 1–4 states, and the 
other  HMM  is  represented  by  the  following  5–8  states.  Specifically, 
states 1–4 depict the waveform of blue whale vocalizations while states 
5–8  represent  the  noise  signal.  Subsequently,  the  feature  vectors 
extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian 
parameters to produce refined feature vectors. The V-alg employs these 
refined feature vectors, along with T  and π, to classify the test dataset as 
either blue whale vocalizations or noise. It is noteworthy that that the V- 
alg switches from states 1–4 to states 5–8 with equal transition proba-
bilities. Table 1 shows the parameters used for WT-HMM simulation. 

3.2. Performance evaluation metrics

The HMM operates in two stages: the training stage and testing stage. 
During the training stage, the extracted feature vectors in Eq. 10 are used 
to estimate three important parameters (i) start probability, π (ii) tran-
sition matrix, T  and (iii) parameters of the Gaussian emission distri-
bution,  ℰ.  The  transition  matrix,  T ,  contains  probability  values  that 
control the transitions between different states. Consequently, the HMM 
represents  the  obtained  feature  vector  from  the  sound  signal  as  a 
sequence  of  states  over  time,  as  dictated  by  the  estimated  T .  The

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the data was divided into training and testing datasets based on the statement "Subsequently, the feature vectors extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors." Additionally, during the training stage, the extracted feature vectors were used to estimate important parameters including the start probability, transition matrix, and parameters of the Gaussian emission distribution. These parameters were then used to represent the obtained feature vector from the sound signal as a sequence of states over time. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data was likely split into training and testing datasets, but the exact criteria used for this division are not specified in the provided context.
