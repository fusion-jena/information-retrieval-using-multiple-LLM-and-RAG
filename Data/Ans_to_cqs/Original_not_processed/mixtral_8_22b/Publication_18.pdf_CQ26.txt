dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

CNNs need a large number of examples to achieve good learning. However, building dataset from scratch is 
costly and time consuming. To overcome these limitations in practice, two techniques are used: Transfer learning 
and data-augmentation. Transfer-learning consists of using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem 
B. This is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on 
problem A. Data-augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images. In general, 
these transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world, e.g., scaling, rotations, trans-
lations, different illumination conditions, cropping parts of the image. It was demonstrated in several works that 
data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs40.

%Query
Query: "What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate response based solely on this context.
