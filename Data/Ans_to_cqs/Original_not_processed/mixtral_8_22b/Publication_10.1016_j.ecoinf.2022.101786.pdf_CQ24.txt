3.1. Model evaluation and selection 

The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong 
influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its 
predictions (Fig. 2). In general, longer model training past 1000 itera-
tions tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

challenge of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea.

2.5. Model selection 

CNNs are sensitive to overfitting (Domingos, 2012). Throughout the 
training process, the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the 
training set - evaluating performance on the validation set – adjusting 
CNN node weights – before repeating the entire cycle. These cycles are 
referred to as epochs or iterations when the training dataset is too large 
to  be  processed  in  one  stroke  and  needs  to  be  subdivided  in  several 
smaller batches as is the case in this study. There is an optimum number 
of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets 
(independent data that the CNN has not seen) start to diverge as the CNN 
overfits  and  becomes  more  specialized  at  predicting  the  training  set 
while becoming less able to predict the validation set (generalization).

Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 
Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation and 
testing  datasets.  Biigle  annotations  (label  name,  centre  x,  center  y,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using strategies like setting specific random seed values. However, some insights can still be derived regarding managing potential issues related to randomness.

One strategy mentioned indirectly is the use of manual annotations to create training, validation, and testing datasets. By manually labeling images, researchers can ensure consistency across different stages of the machine learning pipeline. This approach helps reduce variability introduced by automated processes that may rely on random sampling techniques.

Additionally, the text discusses how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prone to overfitting if they undergo excessive training iterations. To mitigate this issue, the authors mention finding an optimal number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge due to overfitting. This optimization process involves monitoring both the training and validation accuracy during each iteration, ensuring that the model does not become excessively specialized towards the training data while losing its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

While these strategies do not directly address handling randomness via specific random seed values, they contribute to maintaining stability and reducing unwanted variance within the deep learning pipeline.
