were utilized in the study: multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression
(LR), naïve Bayes (NB), CatBoost (CAT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB),
LightGBM (LGB), weighted soft voting (WSOFT), weighted hard voting
(WHARD), blending, and stacking.

and TPE algorithms were implemented in the CatBoost package
(V.1.0.6), LightGBM package (V.3.2.1), XGBoost package (V.1.5.0), and
Hyperopt package (V.0.2.7), respectively.

3.2. Bias–variance decomposition

Predictive models that relate river health to gradients of environ-
mental factors can identify potential causes of impairment in areas of
ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing resto-
ration activities and new monitoring initiatives. Such models should be
generalizable to unseen data for predicting the river health in unmoni-
tored areas. Bias–variance decomposition is widely adopted for gener-
alizability evaluations of ML models (Guan and Burton, 2022; Van Der
Putten and Van Someren, 2004; Van Der Valk and Picek, 2019).
Although deep learning and other ML models have been widely
employed in river health predictions (Gazendam et al., 2016; Kwon
et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021), they have not been supplemented with
evaluation techniques that would confirm their generalizability to un-
seen datasets. In the present study, the generalizability of various ML

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The focus of the given excerpt is on the use of various machine learning models, including deep learning, for river health prediction and the evaluation of their generalizability using bias-variance decomposition. However, it does not discuss the deployment process or any details related to model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
