Abstract

1.	 To	 prevent	 further	 global	 declines	 in	 biodiversity,	 identifying	 and	 understanding	 key

individuals	by	training	deep	learning	models	to	predict	diving	in	European	shags,	

common	guillemots	and	razorbills.	We	validate	our	predictions	using	withheld	data,	

producing	 quantitative	 assessment	 of	 predictive	 accuracy.	 The	 variables	 used	 to	

Handling	Editor:	Jana	McPherson

train	these	models	are	those	recorded	solely	by	the	GPS	device:	variation	in	longi-

tude	and	latitude,	altitude	and	coverage	ratio	(proportion	of	possible	fixes	acquired	

within	a	set	window	of	time).

3.	 Different	combinations	of	these	variables	were	used	to	explore	the	qualities	of	differ-

ent	models,	with	the	optimum	models	for	all	species	predicting	non-diving	and	diving	

behaviour	correctly	over	94%	and	80%	of	the	time,	respectively.	We	also	demonstrate	

the	superior	predictive	ability	of	these	supervised	deep	learning	models	over	other	

commonly	used	behavioural	prediction	methods	such	as	hidden	Markov	models.

each	species.	The	models	were	then	used	to	predict	the	diving	loca-

tions	of	birds	monitored	with	only	GPS	devices.

2.4 | Alternative prediction methods

To	 compare	 predictions	 obtained	 from	 deep	 learning	 models	 with	

methods	 used	 in	 previous	 studies	 classifying	 foraging	 behaviour	 in	

seabirds	HMMs,	a	naïve	Bayes	classifier	and	speed	and	tortuosity	pre-

dictions	were	implemented	on	the	data	(see	Appendix	S8,	supporting	

information	for	details	of	the	latter).	The	Naïve	Bayes	classification,	a	

supervised	 learning	 method,	 was	 implemented	 in	 r	 using	 the	 e1071	

package	 (Meyer,	 Dimitriadou,	 Hornik,	 Weingessel,	 &	 Leisch,	 2015).	

The	inputs	were	the	same	as	used	in	the	H2O	model,	and	the	depend-

ent	 variable	 (variable	 to	 be	 predicted)	 was	 the	 binary	 dive/not	 dive	

column.

HMMs	 are	 an	 unsupervised	 learning	 method	 that	 identifies	 dis-

crete	 states	within	 time-	series	 data	 and	 have	 been	 used	 extensively

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. It would require access to additional resources or direct communication with the authors to obtain this specific piece of information.
