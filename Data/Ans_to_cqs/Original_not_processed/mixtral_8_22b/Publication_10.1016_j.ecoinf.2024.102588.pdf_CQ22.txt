This  study  used  evaluation  metrics  to  estimate  aquatic  ecosystem 
health  indices  (Moriasi  et  al.,  2007).  The  Nash–Sutcliffe  efficiency 
(NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) 
were  used  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  performance  of  the  deep 
learning  models, including the  CNN model and  CNN with an  autoen-
coder, and conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, 
and  XGBoost  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI  values.  The  NSE  is  a 
commonly  used  score  in  hydrological  and  environmental  models  and 
measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the 
degree  of  1:1  line  fitness  of  the  observed  versus  estimated  data  plot 
(Moriasi  et  al.,  2007;  Nash  and  Sutcliffe,  1970).  NSE  ranges  from 
negative infinity to 1, and the mean observed value is used as a refer-
ence.  In  other  words,  an  NSE  below  zero  implies  that  the  estimation

Helpful Answer:
The study uses several evaluation metrics to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. These include the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS). The NSE measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance and indicates the degree of 1:1 line fitness of the observed versus estimated data plot. It ranges from negative infinity to 1, where the mean observed value is used as a reference. An NSE below zero implies poor estimation performance. The RMSE measures the average difference between predicted and actual values, while PBIAS calculates the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts. These metrics were used to assess the performance of both deep learning models (CNN and CNN with an autoencoder) and conventional machine learning models such as ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost for estimating TDI, BMI, and FAI values.
