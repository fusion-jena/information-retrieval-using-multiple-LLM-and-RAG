The YOLOv5 network has three parts: i) backbone: CSPDarknet; ii) 
neck: PANet; and iii) head: YOLO layer. It utilises CSPDarknet53 as the 
backbone by incorporating the crossstage partial network (CSPNet) into 
Darknet (Wang et al., 2020b). A path aggregation network (PANet) (He 
et  al.,  2016)  is  applied  to  this  network  to  boost  information  flow.  In 
PANet, a feature pyramid network (FPN) is adopted with an enhanced

0.3464  on  the  ECUHO-1  and  ECUHO-2  datasets  respectively.  More 
recently, Noman et al. (Noman et al., 2021b) proposed using Faster R- 
CNN with the NASNet model and achieved the highest mAP of 0.291 and 
0.412 on these H. ovalis datasets respectively.

A deep-learning model trained using a dataset from one location does 
not  generalise  to  other  locations  owing  to  the  data  distribution  shift 
problem. Some researchers have mitigated the issue of data distribution 
shifts in different locations. For example, Islam et al. (Islam et al., 2019), 
developed a domain adaptation model by utilising a generative adver-
sarial network that aligns marginal data distribution between the target 

and source domains.

Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repository link for the deep learning pipelines discussed. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a direct answer to the query without additional information. However, some common repositories where such links might be found include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. To find the relevant data repository link, one could search for the authors' names or keywords related to their research in these platforms.
