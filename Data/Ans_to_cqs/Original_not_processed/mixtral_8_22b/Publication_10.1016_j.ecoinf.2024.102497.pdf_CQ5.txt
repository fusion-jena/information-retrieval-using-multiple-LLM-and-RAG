2.2. Data sources and pre-processing 

We acquired GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources 
Satellite Data and Application (http://www.cresda.com/CN/) (Table 1). 
The  GF-6  remote  sensing  data  were  preprocessed,  mainly  including 
radiometric  calibration,  atmospheric  correction,  geometric  correction 
and image cropping.

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention of any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the use of GF-6 (WFV) data obtained from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application for predicting wetland areas and depths using different models.

In this study, researchers primarily focused on utilizing remote sensing data from the GF-6 satellite and applying various models, including linear or nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques such as CART, RFR, and SVM. They also mentioned advancements in bathymetry retrieval methods leading to the development of multiple models.

However, if you need information about datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, here's some general knowledge:

1. MNIST: A database of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. CIFAR: Consists of two datasets - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Both contain 60,000 color images scaled down to 32x32 pixels. CIFAR-10 consists of 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes.

3. ImageNet: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. It currently holds more than 14 million images, which are organized into roughly 21,000 categories.
