Equation values >86.976 are classified as fisher and values less than 
this  value  are  classified  as  marten.  Statistical  summaries  of  measure-
ments for the most important variables for species identification from 
predictor  screening  and  the  final  species  discrimination  model  are 
detailed in Table 2. 

3.4.2. Fisher sex discrimination

We  used  a  stepwise  variable  selection  procedure  with  the  p-value 
serving as the decisive factor (threshold of 0.05) to select the variables 
that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. We used 
linear  discriminant  analysis  to  generate  a  discrimination  line  (2  vari-
ables) or hyperplane (>3 variables) depending on the number of vari-
ables  in  the  resulting  model  to  classify  species  or  sex.  To  quantify 
uncertainty  in  classification,  we  then  generated  bands  of  uncertainty 
around  this  discrimination  hyperplane.  We  assigned  values  that  fall 
within these bands a probability value (p) indicating a level of certainty 
about the classification using a logistic regression model, as in Eq. (1)

3.4.1. Fisher and Marten species discrimination 

We found the best model for species discrimination between fisher 
and marten consisted of 12 variables and had near perfect classification 
success, only misclassifying 1 out of 532 tracks as the wrong species. 
However, as this full species discrimination model was so complex, we 
used backward stepwise selection to try to identify an effective model 
with fewer variables. We found a univariable model consisting only of 
variable V16 had a species classification success of over 99% only mis-
classifying  4/532  tracks  as  the  incorrect  species.  Based  on  this  single 
variable a track measurement where V16 > 3.17 has a 90% probability 
of  being  a  fisher.  The  discrimination  line  for  the  simple  species 
discrimination model is given by the Eq. (2): 

Species Discrimination Model : 28.853*V16 = 86.976
