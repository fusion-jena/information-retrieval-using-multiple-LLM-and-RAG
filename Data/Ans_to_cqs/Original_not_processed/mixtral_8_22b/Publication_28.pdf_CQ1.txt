Lunga  et  al.  (2020)  presented  a  new  remote  sensing  data  flow 
(RESFlow) to an advanced ML for computing huge amount of remotely 
sensed images. The important role is separating huge amount of data for 
homogeneous distribution to fit easier modules. Nguyen et  al. (2020) 
proposed  a  new  multi  temporal  high  spatial  resolution  classification 
technique using an innovative spatio temporal spectral DNN for locating 
paddy fields at the pixel level for an entire year and temporal instances. 
Boulila et al. (2021) proposed a new distributed DL based method for 
classifying the big remote sensing images. Particularly, they proposed an 
RS-DCNN for managing image classification. The initial phase is to make 
the  training  dataset  for  RS-DCNN.  Later,  for  ensuring  a  data  parallel 
training  on  Apache  Spark  architecture,  a  pixel  based  CNN  module 
through the big data cluster is executed by BigDL.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that satellite images are being used as input data for various machine learning and deep learning models. These satellite images could have been collected through satellites equipped with imaging devices such as cameras or other types of sensors. Additionally, some studies mentioned in the context use publicly available datasets like RESFlow and RS-DCNN for their research. It should also be noted that the context mentions the use of Apache Spark architecture for executing a pixel-based CNN module, which suggests that the authors might have used existing datasets rather than collecting raw data themselves. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data collection methods in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed how exactly the raw data was gathered.
