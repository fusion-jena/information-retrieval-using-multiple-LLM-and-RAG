Recognizing the significant role of oil palm, extensive research has been 
conducted,  as  evidenced  by  studies  from  Melidawati  et  al.  (2021), 
Tuerxun et al. (2020), and Ang et al. (2022), each contributing insights 
into  oil  palm  cultivation  and  management.  Predicting  oil  palm  crop 
yields is crucial to effectively managing and optimizing the palm supply 
chain. It requires the incorporation of multiple datasets and is influenced 
by numerous variables, including climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer 
use, and seed varieties (Xu et al., 2019). Applying Machine learning and 
deep learning models can accurately predict crop yields, aiding farmers 
in harvest planning and crop management decisions (Attri et al., 2023). 
Although these techniques have been implemented across various crops 
for environment-based yield forecasting, their deployment for predictive 
analysis of oil palm yields remains in its infancy (Rajakal et al., 2021).

The rising global demand for oil palm emphasizes the importance of accurate oil palm yield predictions. This 
predictive  capability  is  critical  for  effective  crop  management,  supply  chain  optimization,  and  sustainable 
farming practices. However, the oil palm sector faces challenges in yield projection, stressing a noteworthy gap in 
the application and evaluation of modern machine learning and deep learning technologies. Our study addressed 
this  gap  by  systematically  evaluating  17  machine  and  deep  learning  models  in  predicting  oil  palm  yield, 
incorporating various agronomic parameters, e.g., soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming 
techniques. This holistic approach enhances the application of machine and deep learning in agriculture. Using 
the  feature  selection  technique  and  a  maximum  depth  of  32  and  1000  estimators,  the  Extra  Trees  Regressor

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study employs comprehensive datasets and in-depth research using machine and deep learning techniques for predicting oil palm yields. The datasets likely include various agronomic parameters such as soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot confirm if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular study.
