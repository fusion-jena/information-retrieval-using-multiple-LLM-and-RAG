dataset  contains  638  images,  divided  into  seven  categories,  with  510 
images for training and  128 for testing. The trash-ICRA19 dataset in-
cludes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training 
and 229 for testing. The VisDrone dataset is selected as part of the Tiny 
Target Dataset and comprises 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. 
The training set consists of 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 
images. NWPU VHR-10 and HRSID are small target datasets for remote 
sensing. The NWPU VHR-10 dataset includes 800 images with ten cat-
egories, and the training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, 
respectively. The HRSID dataset contains 5604 images in one category, 
and the training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respec-
tively. By testing YWnet on these diverse datasets, we aimed to assess its 
performance in various scenarios, including marine environments and 
detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.

their ability to automatically learn and extract low- and high-level visual 
features  directly  from  the  data.  Traditional  methods  often  require 
manual  feature  engineering,  where  domain-specific  knowledge  and 
expertise are used to design handcrafted features. Deep learning algo-
rithms,  on  the  other  hand,  can  learn  feature  representations  directly 
from the raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engi-
neering.  Efficiently  handling  these  multiscale  features  is  crucial  for 
network performance, given their diverse resolutions. Feature pyramid 
networks  (FPNs)  have  made  significant  advancements  by  integrating 
multiscale  features  in  a  top-down  manner.  The  path  aggregation 
network  (PANet)  (Liu  et  al.,  2016)  further  extends  the  FPN  by  intro-
ducing a bottom-up path. Another notable network learning mechanism, 
the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) (Tan et al., 2020),

To extract the input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel 
analysis  of  the  input  feature  map  using  two  convolution  kernels.  In 
contrast to the C3 block, the SRC3 block incorporates two convolution 
kernels prior to the input of the bottleneck block. One of the kernels is 
responsible  for  halving  the  dimension  of  the  feature  map,  while  the 
other  maintains  the  dimension  unchanged.  This  approach  allows  for 
more  comprehensive  processing  of  the  input  features,  enabling  the 
model  to  capture  both  high-level  semantic  information  and  preserve 
relevant details during the feature extraction process. The convolution 
kernel size utilized is 3 × 3, which leads to a broader receptive field of 
information and richer characteristics compared to the 1 × 1 convolu-
tion kernel. The output semantic information can be augmented by the 
action of two convolution kernels. The information output from the first

For the experiments, we utilized the URPC datasets, which consist of 
a total of 1201 images. These datasets contain four object categories: 
holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. In this study, we divide the 
experimental data into training and test sets, following an 8:2 ratio. The 
training process of YWnet utilized a dataset consisting of 956 images, 
while a separate test set of 244 images was used to evaluate the model's 
generalization capabilities. This division of data into training and test 
sets  allows  for  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  algorithm's  perfor-
mance. To evaluate the generalization capabilities of YWnet, we con-
ducted tests on five additional datasets. Table 1 provides an overview of 
these  datasets,  including  Aquarium,  Trash-ICRA19,  VisDrone,  NWPU 
VHR-10, and HRSID. Aquarium and Trash-ICRA19 are part of the Marine 
Dataset, comprising marine animals and waste categories. The aquarium

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, several datasets were mentioned as being used in the deep learning pipeline. These include the URPC dataset, which consists of 1201 images containing four object categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. For the experiments, the experimental data was divided into training and test sets following an 8:2 ratio, resulting in a training set of 956 images and a test set of 244 images. Additionally, the paper mentions conducting tests on five more datasets to evaluate the generalization capabilities of YWnet. These datasets include Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID. Aquarium and Trash-ICRA19 are part of the Marine Dataset, which comprises marine animals and waste categories. However, specific details about the number of images or classes in each of these datasets are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
