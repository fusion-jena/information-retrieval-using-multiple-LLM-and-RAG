4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

Several large-scale repositories of FAIR biodiversity data are publicly 
available (Candela et al., 2015). Among these, the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility (GBIF) (Lane and Edwards, 2007) and the Ocean 
Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) (Grassle, 2000) are often used 
in ecological and ecosystem models. Data FAIRness is guaranteed by the 
adoption  of  domain-specific  standards  (e.g.,  Darwin  Core  (Wieczorek 
et  al.,  2012))  and  large-scale  e-Infrastructures  providing  high- 
availability access services (Assante et al., 2019; Assante et al., 2022; 
Candela  et  al.,  2015).  These  repositories  include  millions  of  records 
regarding species’ observations across multiple decades, allowing spe-
cies presence and commonness tracking over time. However, these data 
should be used cautiously because they could include sampling biases - 
due to varying sampling efforts and paths over time and space - driving

in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was trained using a diverse dataset obtained from large-scale repositories such as GBIF and OBIS, which contain millions of records regarding species' observations across multiple decades. This suggests that the dataset used for training the model was likely diverse in terms of both temporal and spatial coverage. Additionally, the mention of potential sampling biases due to varying sampling efforts and paths over time and space indicates awareness of the need to address issues related to data quality and representativeness when developing predictive models. While the text does not explicitly discuss techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods are commonly employed to improve the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it can be assumed that similar approaches may have been applied in this case, although further details would be needed to confirm this.
