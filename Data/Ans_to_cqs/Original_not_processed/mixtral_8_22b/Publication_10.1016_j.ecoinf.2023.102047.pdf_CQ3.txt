image,  and  the  produced  feature  maps  are  cropped  upon  the  object 
proposal. An RoI pooling layer is applied to extract a fixed length vector. 
This  feature  vector  is  processed  through  fully  connected  networks  to 
predict class probabilities and refine the bounding boxes. Faster R-CNN 
(Ren et al., 2015) is the most popular object detection algorithm. In the 
Faster R-CNN model, the input images are fed into a CNN, which pro-
duces feature maps from the input images. A different neural network, 
RPN, is applied to predict the candidate bounding boxes. RoI pooling 
layers are applied to reshape the inputs. These properties render these 
two-stage  detectors  superior  to  one-stage  detectors.  Among  the  two- 
stage  detector,  EfficientDet  (Tan  et  al.,  2020)  architecture  is  gaining 
popularity owing to its excellent detection performance as  well as its 
relatively lower FLOPS (floating point operations per second) than in 
other object detection models.

Dataset labelling is one of the most time-consuming tasks in com-
puter vision. Supervised machine-learning or deep learning algorithms 
learn to classify or detect an object from huge, labelled datasets. Eval-
uation of the models also requires labelled datasets. The datasets used in 
this study were labelled using ‘LabelImg’  software under expert guid-
ance. ‘LabelImg’ is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python. 
All the labelled files were saved in PASCAL VOC format as .xml files. A 
sample  image  labelled  using  the  ‘LabelImg’  software  is  presented  in 
Fig. 5. For the Faster R-CNN model training and testing, all the datasets 
were  converted  into  ‘TFRecords’  file  format.  We  used  TensorFlow’s 
Python script to convert the Pascal VOC format dataset to the Tensor-
Flow record format. This file format is well-optimised for TensorFlow, 
and it internally uses protocol buffers to serialise and deserialise the data

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of 'LabelImg', we can infer that bounding box annotation was employed. LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python, often used for labeling objects within images by drawing bounding boxes around them. The labeled files were then saved in PASCAL VOC format as.xml files, further supporting this assumption. Additionally, since the paper discusses object detection using Faster R-CNN, another reasonable assumption would be that instance segmentation might have been utilized as well. Instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects and creating pixel-wise masks for each identified instance. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated whether instance segmentation was indeed part of the data annotation process.
