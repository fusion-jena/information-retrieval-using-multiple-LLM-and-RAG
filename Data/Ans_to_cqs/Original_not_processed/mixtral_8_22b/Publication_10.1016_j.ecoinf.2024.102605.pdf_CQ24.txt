Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during model training and evaluation. This ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code is executed. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps reduce the impact of any single run being influenced by chance factors such as initialization weights or order of data presentation. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by providing more robust estimates of model performance across various subsets of the dataset. However, it should be noted that these methods do not eliminate all sources of variability but rather aim to minimize their impact on overall results.
