(black) and with (red) machine learning prediction
on deeply learned features (outputs of the two last
layers of the MLP are concatenated and passed as
input to a logistic regression). Features from global
average pooling layer of four ResNet18s are fed to a
MLP made of three fully connected layers of size: 512
and 256 with ReLU activation, and 61 with softmax
for classification. (For interpretation of the refer-

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the available information.
