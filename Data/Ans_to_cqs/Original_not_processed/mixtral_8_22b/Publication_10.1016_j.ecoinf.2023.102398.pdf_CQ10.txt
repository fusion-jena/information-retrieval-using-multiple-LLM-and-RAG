In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

The work is based on the popular YOLOv5 architecture integrated 

with a SENet attention mechanism (Zhu et al., 2021). 

The  YOLO  (You  Only  Look  Once)  is  a  simple  and  extremely  fast 
object detection algorithm that avoids a complex pipeline and considers 

â€¢ Backbone: A CNN, which acts as the main body of the network, is 
designed using the New CSP-Darknet53 (Cao et al., 2023) structure. 
It extracts key features from the input image.
