Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Generally, the proposed network system has 
20  layers:  12  convolutional  layers,  five 
pooling  layers,  one  Fully  Connected  layer, 
one LSTM layer, and one output layer with 
the  softmax  function  for  classification.  The 
convolutional  layer  with  a  size  of  3  ×  3 
kernels is used for extracting feature and it is 
activated  by  the  ReLU  function.  The  max-
pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is 
applied to reduce the dimensions of an input 
image. In the last part of the architecture, the 
function map is shifted to the LSTM layer to

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model described in this paper is for classification. Specifically, the model aims to classify images of plant species into one of 100 different categories. This is achieved through the use of a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) units. The CNN layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, while the LSTM layer is used to analyze temporal information and aid in the final classification task. The output layer of the model uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each of the 100 possible classes. Overall, the goal of this model is to accurately identify and categorize various plant species based on their visual characteristics.
