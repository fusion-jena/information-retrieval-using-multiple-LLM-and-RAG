To  assess  the  accuracy  of  water  quality  parameter  predictions, 
various analyses and indicators are commonly employed. In our study, 
we evaluated the effectiveness of our model using four specific metrics: 
the coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean 
square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), as represented by 
Eqs. (6) to (9). The R2 quantifies the fraction of variance in the depen-
dent variable accounted for by the independent variables in the model. 
The  MBE  primarily  evaluates  the  model’s  average  bias,  assisting  in 
identifying if any rectifications are required to address this bias. This 
metric identifies the mean deviation in the estimations, with a positive 
bias indicating a tendency to overestimate relative to the dataset values. 
RMSE calculates the discrepancies between predicted and true values, 
while MAE quantifies the average size of these prediction errors. Supe-

involves  determining  the  number  of  neurons  in  the  hidden  layers 
(Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016).  While  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  does  not 
exist, a commonly employed rule, as shown in Eq. (5), suggests, that H 
denotes the number of neurons in each hidden layer and N represents the 
number of input features (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Hardesty, 2017). 

H = 2 × N + 1

In  crafting  and  assessing  the  models,  MATLAB  programming  soft-
ware (MathWorks, 2021) served as the primary tool. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
architectural details of these algorithms. The objective was to pinpoint 
the most effective algorithm tailored for this particular application by 
scrutinizing each model’s capability to predict TSM concentration solely 
based on wind speed data.

Generally, the principal aim of this study is to introduce an innova-
tive machine learning model designed to predict lake TSM concentration 
exclusively using wind speed, focusing on the Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs 
(CNRs)  in  Sistan,  Iran.  The  research  adopts  a  dual-focused  strategy: 
firstly, an in-depth analysis of the correlation between TSM concentra-
tion  and  wind  speed,  utilizing  both  satellite-derived  TSM  and  on-site 
wind  speed  data  to  formulate  a  model  for  TSM  retrieval  based  on 
wind  speed;  secondly,  an  exploration  of  temporal  transferability  by 
introducing an unprecedented machine learning model customized for 
TSM  estimation,  relying  solely  on  wind  speed.  To  accomplish  these 
objectives, wind speed data collected from CNRs and TSM concentration 
derived  from  a  time  series  of  satellite  imagery  were  seamlessly  inte-
grated to train a refined model.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The performance of the deep learning model in this study is evaluated using four specific metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance. The R2 metric measures the proportion of the dependent variable variation explained by the independent variables in the model. The MBE helps identify any systematic bias in the model's predictions, while the RMSE and MAE provide insights into the magnitude of the prediction errors. Higher R2 scores, lower RMSE and MAE scores, and MBE figures close to zero indicate better model performance.
