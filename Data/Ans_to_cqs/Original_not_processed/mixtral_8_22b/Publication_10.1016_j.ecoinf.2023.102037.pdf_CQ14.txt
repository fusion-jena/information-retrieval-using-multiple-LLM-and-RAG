2.3. Data splitting and image tiling

Fig. 5. A) Illustration of the procedure for separating data into training, validation and test sets, and tiling sticky plate images by finding regions of interest of a fixed 
size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes. B) Illustration of applying the YOLOv5 model on a sticky plate image using 
“Slicing Aided Hyper Inference” (SAHI).

ayanan, 2022). In our previous research (Kalfas et al., 2021; Kalfas et al., 
2022), we showed that model performance can be highly overestimated 
when weak validation procedures – like random data splitting- are fol-
lowed.  Despite  taking  the  above  limitations  into  consideration,  other 
studies  still  only  focused  on  datasets  where  insect  classes  were  quite 
broad – insect order or family level, quite dissimilar and thus, relatively 
easy to classify (Rustia et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2020c).

3.2. Model performance 

To validate our model in a practice-oriented way, we split our data 
on the sticky plate level. Therefore, individual insects that belonged to 
the  same  sticky  plate  image  were  kept  together  in  the  same  dataset 
(training, validation, or testing). This allowed us to validate our model’s 
performance by emulating the way in which the model will be used in 
practice. Namely, it predicted a class for any given object it detected on 
unseen sticky plate images – data it never saw during training.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It is possible that the authors used methods such as grid search or random search, but without explicit mention, this cannot be confirmed.
