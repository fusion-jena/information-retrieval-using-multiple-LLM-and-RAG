Further, the same can be used for developing a data-driven carbon 
exchange model at a local scale.  

3.  In the network, few variables remain active at lower lags, and few 
variables capture a significant amount of information connectivity at 
higher lags. A general observation shows that the number of links 
decreases (e.g., incoming to NEE and LH) with an increase in lags. 
However, RE shows the opposite behavior.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I can provide some insight into these techniques.

Regularization methods are commonly employed in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to avoid overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce this problem by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This encourages simpler models and prevents them from fitting the training data too closely.

Two popular regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons. It has been shown to improve the performance of neural networks significantly. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of weights as a penalty term to the loss function. By doing so, it discourages large weight values and promotes smaller ones, leading to more generalized models.
