2.6.3. Training process 

To fit into the network, the training set must have its data normalized 
and standardized. For the training network, the batch size was set to 32. 
The purposes for selecting 32 were to not exceed the memory limit and 
to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used Adam pro-
cessing, and the learning ratio varied with group based on the cosine 
function’s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The 100 epochs 
are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if 
there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function 
used is the cross-entropy loss function (Abd-Ellah et al., 2024).

once by adding the salinity indices, NDSI and NDVI in different com-
binations, as shown in Table 5. Then, the satellite images were split into 
70%  and  30%  for  training  and  testing,  respectively.  After  that,  the 
proposed  model  was  trained  and  tested  using  the  combination  image 
with the ground truth image. The presented model is a pixel-based deep 
learning segmentation architecture.

Helpful Answer:
The given text mentions that the satellite images were split into 70% and 30% for training and testing, respectively. However, it does not explicitly state any specific criteria used to split the data. In general, when splitting data for machine learning or deep learning models, one common approach is to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. This random division helps ensure that each subset has similar statistical properties to the original dataset. Another approach could be stratified sampling, where the splits maintain the same distribution of classes as in the original dataset. Without further information from the authors, we cannot determine which method they employed for this study.
