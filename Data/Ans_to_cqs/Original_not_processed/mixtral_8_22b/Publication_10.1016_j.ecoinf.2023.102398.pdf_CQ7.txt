In  order  to  determine  more  accurate  training  results  and  also  to 
explore the effect of epoch upon training result, apart from 150 epochs, 
the model with attention layer is trained with epoch values 100, 200, 
and  250  under  a  uniform  training  environment  and  with  the  same 
dataset.  The  training  summary  for  each  of  these  epochs  is  shown  in 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. The trends 
of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15. 
The size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large. 
Further, the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyper 
parameters  for  which  overfitting  and  under  fitting  situations  are  pre-
vented from occurring. As mentioned above, the effort to over-train the 
model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has 
been  adopted  to  fine-tune  the  model.  Results  obtained  for  different

The confusion matrix (Fig. 6), F1 curve (Fig. 7), P curve (Fig. 8), PR 
curve (Fig. 9), R curve (Fig. 10) and final training plots (Fig. 11) are 
shown for the training of the model with attention layer with epoch-150. 
Some training batch outputs are shown in Fig. 12, and some validation 
outputs are shown in Fig. 13.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention how the data was split for deep learning model training (i.e., into train, test, or validation sets). However, it can be inferred that the authors have followed standard practices for splitting the data. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune the parameters of the model. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the fully specified model. In this case, the authors have used a sufficiently large dataset for custom training and have taken measures to prevent overfitting and underfitting situations. They have also used a uniform training environment and the same dataset for all epoch values. Therefore, it can be assumed that they have followed best practices for splitting the data.
