resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and

advanced  cloud  computing  capabilities  to  do  extensive  geospatial 
computations  for  quantifying  carbon  emissions  from  forest  fires  with 
intricate influencing factors (Goparaju et al., 2023).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the data is stored on Google Drive in CSV format for further analysis. It also refers to an official documentation link (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084) which might contain more details about the data repository. Unfortunately, without additional context or direct reference to a specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
