Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning pipelines, some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of objects within images.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label and an instance ID. It is useful for identifying individual instances of objects within an image.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label but without distinguishing between different instances of the same class. It is useful for understanding the overall structure of an image.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects of interest in an image. It is useful for accurately outlining complex shapes.

5. Key Point Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object in an image. It is useful for tasks such as pose estimation or facial landmark detection.

Without more specific context, it is impossible to determine which of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context.
