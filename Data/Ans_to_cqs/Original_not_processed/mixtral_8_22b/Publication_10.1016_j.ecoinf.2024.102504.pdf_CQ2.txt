3. Results 

3.1. Data statistics

d)  Utilization of ESM: The ESM approach provides an effective method 
for air pollution forecasting based on Sentinel-5P datasets, offering 
flexibility with the dataset’s limited timeframe and providing a novel 
method for predicting future trends in air pollution concentrations 
within industrial clusters.  

e)  Integration  of  RS  Data:  The  integration  of  Copernicus  Sentinel-5 
Precursor vertical column density (VCD) data products with auxil-
iary  datasets  presents  an  innovative  approach  to  analyzing  air 
pollution, contributing to the advancement of air quality monitoring 
methodologies. 

These  contributions  collectively  offer  valuable  insights  into  the 
complex nature of air pollution and its relationship with industrial ac-
tivities, thereby advancing the understanding of air quality dynamics in 
the Tehran province.

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context primarily focus on air quality analysis and prediction using various methods such as deep learning, machine learning, and remote sensing techniques. However, none of them explicitly mention the specific data format used in their respective deep learning pipelines.

In general, deep learning pipelines can use various types of data formats depending on the problem being solved. For instance, image classification tasks might use image files like.jpg or.png, while speech recognition tasks could utilize audio files like.wav or.mp3. Similarly, video processing tasks would require video file formats like.avi or.mp4. On the other hand, tabular data is often stored in structured formats like.csv or.txt.

Given the context, it can be inferred that some studies may have utilized satellite imagery data from sources like Sentinel-5P datasets, which typically come in raster data formats like GeoTIFF. Additionally, there might also be usage of meteorological data, air pollutant concentration measurements, and other relevant environmental parameters, which are usually available in numerical formats like.csv or.txt.

However, without explicit information about each study's deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats were employed. Therefore, further research into individual studies would be required to determine the precise data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines.
