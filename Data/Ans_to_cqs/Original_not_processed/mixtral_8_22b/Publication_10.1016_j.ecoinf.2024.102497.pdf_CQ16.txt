by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the 
target  variable  within  each  subset.  This  iterative  process  employs  a 
greedy  algorithm,  gradually  building  the  tree  until  specific  stopping 
conditions  are  met.  The  key  components  of  CART  involve  feature  se-
lection, tree generation, and pruning. For our implementation, we uti-
lized the Python programming language to build the CART model. The 
CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python. To 
optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability, we 
fine-tuned  specific  model  parameters  such  as  ‘max_depth’,  ‘min_sam-
ples_leaf’, and ‘max_leaf_nodes’. Ultimately, we set these parameters to 
8,  5,  and  20,  respectively.  These  parameter  values  were  selected  to 
prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in our model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for either the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) or Random Forest Regression (RFR) methods. However, it can be inferred that the authors optimized their models by fine-tuning specific parameters to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation errors.

For the CART method, they adjusted'max_depth','min_samples_leaf', and'max_leaf_nodes'. Similarly, for the RFR method, they experimented with'max_depth','min_samples_split','min_samples_leaf', and'max_features'. Although the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not mentioned, it is common practice in machine learning to use metrics like validation loss plateaus, early stopping, or reaching a predefined number of epochs/iterations to decide when to stop training.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is reasonable to assume that the authors employed standard practices in machine learning, such as monitoring validation loss or other performance metrics during training to ensure optimal model performance and avoid overfitting.
