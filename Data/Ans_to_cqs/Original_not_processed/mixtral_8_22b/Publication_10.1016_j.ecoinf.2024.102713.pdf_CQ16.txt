The relational schema of CASE’s database is shown in Fig. A.18. CASE is based on a concept of Task, i.e., a questionnaire that must be fulfilled by a 
User (i.e., an on-field operator). Each task is composed by a set of Questions, categorized in different types (e.g., multiple answers, date picker) each 
composed by a set of predefined Answers (one of which could be an open answer, defined by the user when selecting the Given answer). The 
dynamic aspect of CASE’s questionnaires lies in the association of each possible answer with a different one to be shown next. Thus, users fulfilling the 
same task may follow different paths of questions depending on the given answers. This enables a customized and efficient user experience, as detailed 
questions on a given topic may be asked only if such a topic has been mentioned by the user. Instances of tasks (i.e., Task on geo-object) are

For  these  reasons,  a  validation  process  is  needed  to  ensure  that 
analytical  activities  are  carried  out  on  clean  and  consistent  data.  In 
particular, we validate H. halys captures as follows.  

• Traps with at least 10 consecutive weeks of non-entered data or with 
at least 5 registered malfunctioning were reported as “invalid” and 
not used in the data analysis.

The  slight  difference  between  the  two  methods  suggests  that  the 
automatic SVP quantification method can be used as a valid and effec-
tive replacement for the manual one. Ultimately, this result (i) demon-
strates how the power of the data platform can be harnessed to relieve 
technicians from a burdensome and easily error-prone manual activity, 
and (ii) provides the necessary validation to use the automatic calcula-
tion for the subsequent analytical activities. 

4.3. Factors influencing H. halys presence 

The integration and enrichment activities in the data platform enable 
the association of H. halys captures with several attributes (or features) 
that can motivate the presence of the target pest. The nature of these
