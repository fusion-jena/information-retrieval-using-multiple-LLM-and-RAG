Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research paper utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, a 10-meter spatial resolution digital elevation model (DEM) is employed as auxiliary data. Field investigations are also conducted to gather more accurate soil information. Furthermore, a soil sample database is established using a combination of remote sensing techniques and ground truth data. The use of remote sensing allows for the acquisition of large amounts of data over vast areas quickly and efficiently. Ground truth data, on the other hand, provides valuable insights into the actual conditions on the ground, which can be used to validate and improve the accuracy of remotely sensed data. Overall, these methods enable the researchers to collect comprehensive and reliable data sets that can be used to train their deep learning models effectively.
