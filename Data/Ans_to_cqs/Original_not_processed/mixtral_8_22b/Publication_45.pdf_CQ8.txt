Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Addressing  current  global  challenges  such  as  biodiversity  loss,  global  change,  and 
increasing  demands  for  ecosystem  services  requires  improved  ecological  prediction. 
Recent increases in data availability, process understanding, and computing power are 
fostering quantitative approaches in ecology. However, flexible methodological frameworks 
are needed to utilize these developments towards improved ecological prediction. Deep 
learning  is  a  rapidly  evolving  branch  of  machine  learning,  yet  has  received  only  little 
attention in ecology to date. It refers to the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e. 
artificial neural networks consisting of many layers and a large number of neurons. We 
here  provide  a  reproducible  example  (including  code  and  data)  of  designing,  training, 
and  applying  DNNs  for  ecological  prediction.  Using  bark  beetle  outbreaks  in  conifer-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset used in this study is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). Given that the authors emphasize providing a reproducible example including both code and data, it can be assumed that the code might also be available alongside the dataset or through another online platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Unfortunately, without more specific information from the given context, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository.
