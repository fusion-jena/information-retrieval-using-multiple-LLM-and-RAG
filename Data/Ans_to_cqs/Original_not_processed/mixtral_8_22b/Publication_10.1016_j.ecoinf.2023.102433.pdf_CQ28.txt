2.  According to the cloud architecture, GEE is a SaaS (Software-as-a- 
service). This translates into services (e.g., available datasets, allo-
cated resources, implemented algorithms, export data formats, and 
so on) entirely managed by Google and not (or hardly) modifiable by 
the single user. For instance, in GEE deep learning analysis can be 
performed  using  Tensorflow,  a  machine  learning  and  artificial  in-
telligence  open-source  framework  developed  by  the  Google  Brain 
team (Abadi et al., 2016). Although Tensorflow is one of the leading 
machine  learning  frameworks,  this  excludes  the  possibility  of 
employing different open-source machine learning systems such as 
PyTorch primarily developed by Facebook AI Research lab (FAIR) 
(Ketkar and Jojo, 2021), Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (Seide 
and Amit, 2016), Caffe of the University of California, Berkeley, US 
(Jia et al., 2014) or novel algorithms for deep learning (Zhu et al.,

library allows the user to query the NASA service to discover all products 
available  for  a  given  reference  date.  This  is  done  by  the  availa-
ble_products_by_date() method, which returns the list of all products along 
with their availability. This allows users to optimize the pipeline for data 
download by limiting requests to available products.

Helpful Answer:
According to the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform managed by Google. Therefore, it can be inferred that the platform used to deploy the deep learning model is Google Cloud Platform. However, it should be noted that while GEE is built on top of Google Cloud Platform, it does not provide direct access to the underlying infrastructure like traditional cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Instead, GEE provides a high-level abstraction layer that enables users to perform large-scale geospatial analyses without having to manage the underlying infrastructure themselves. In summary, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Cloud Platform via the use of Google Earth Engine.
