of understory terrain using RGB cameras. In this circumstance, machine 
learning  methods,  such  as  random  forests,  support  vector  machines, 
feature fusion techniques, and neural networks, may be more adept at 
establishing  AGB  equations  through  the  integration  of  UAV-LiDAR, 
hyperspectral,  and  high-resolution  RGB  data  (Brodi´c  et  al.,  2022;

Nevertheless,  the  trees  within  the  study  plot  were  planted  in  pits 
(Fig.  1b),  and  the  generated  DTM  elevates  the  height  of  these  pits, 
leading to a lower H extracted from the CHM compared to the ground- 
measured H (Fig. 6d). During the extraction of individual tree canopy 
boundaries,  ground  cover  classification  based  on  the  DOM  may  yield 
incomplete  canopy  coverage.  However,  by  buffering  the  canopy 
boundaries, the CD obtained from aerial surveys closely matched ground

adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of forest morphological 
characteristics  and  biomass.  However,  the  field  survey  is  time- 
consuming and resource-intensive (Viana et al., 2012).

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various machine learning methods like random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks being used for establishing Aboveground Biomass (AGB) equations. These methods could potentially incorporate techniques to handle data bias, but the context does not provide explicit information about them.

Techniques commonly used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving model generalization.

In summary, although the given context does not explicitly mention techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common approaches include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
