Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

These  two  examples  of  small  sample  sizes  highlight  a  conflict  in 
preferred protocol. Ideally, (1) all species would be included in a clas-
sification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity, (2) 
all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to 
better represent the variability found in the area, and (3) only confident 
‘ground truth’ classifications would be considered in the training model. 
Unfortunately, in species where identity must be determined based on 
call characteristics (rather than visual confirmation of species identity in 
the field), it can sometimes be difficult to confidently determine species 
identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one 
call  that  provides  high  confidence  of  species  identity.  In  the  case  of 
beaked whales, we recommend that training data include a high level of 
confidence for inclusion. This is especially critical for species with small

study area, our results suggest that reasonable classification results can 
be obtained for all species using BANTER classification methods with as 
few as two samples per class.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a certain accuracy threshold. However, it does mention that the recommended approach for training data includes a high level of confidence for inclusion, particularly for species with small study areas. It also suggests that reasonable classification results can be obtained for all species using BANTER classification methods with as few as two samples per class. Therefore, while the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified, it appears that the focus is on ensuring a high level of confidence in the training data and obtaining satisfactory classification results even with limited samples.
