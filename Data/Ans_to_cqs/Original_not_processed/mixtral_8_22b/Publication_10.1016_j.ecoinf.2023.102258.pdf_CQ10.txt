Such fragmentation hinders the practical usability of deep learning 
in bioacoustics, and thus in the life sciences at large. Indeed to date, the 
success of deep neural networks in the supervised regime depends on the 
availability of a massive corpus of audio examples for the sound events 
of interest, paired with human annotations. Yet, temporally-precise and 
fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly 
and time-consuming. In many cases, the obstacle is not only to acquire 
annotations, but also the audio examples themselves: e.g. for rare spe-
cies,  remote  locations,  or  costly  equipment.  Furthermore,  these 
numerous small-data scenarios remain outside the scope of digital bio-
acoustic archives, such as Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library.

• Transductive  few-shot  learning  -  Meta  learning  methods  aim  to 
learn on scarce data in order to generalise to unseen tasks,  which 
makes the problem fundamentally difficult. In order to mitigate the 
difficulty, transductive based methods utilise the information present 
in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and 
improve its predictions. In Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support 
and query set are jointly modelled as nodes of a graph and the pre-
diction on query set is conducted by label-propagation algorithm. In 
Hou  et  al.  (2019),  a  cross-attention  based  map  is  learnt  between 
support set and query set in order to make predictions on individual 
query examples.

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The given text includes various references to research papers, authors, methodologies, and techniques related to deep learning in bioacoustics, but it does not contain any direct links to specific code repositories. To find the relevant code repository, you would need more detailed information about the project or system being discussed.
