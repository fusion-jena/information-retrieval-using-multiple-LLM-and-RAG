Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

Fig. 6 shows predicted VWC values range from 10% to 40%, with a
standard error of 2.5% to 7.5%. It shows the distribution of predicted
values obtained with the developed predictive model with false color
compostion of selected PlanetScope satellite imagery. The obtained
values of soil water content in individual areas of the heap can be related
to land cover categories. At the grassland site, the model indicates
significantly higher VWC values (Fig. 5), which is confirmed by the
analysis of measured data obtained in different land cover classes.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which framework was utilized. However, these are popular choices among researchers and developers when building deep learning models.
