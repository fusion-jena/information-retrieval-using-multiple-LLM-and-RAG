Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? "

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on specific datasets used in any deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on various research papers related to hydrological forecasting, data-driven modeling, and other topics. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine which datasets were used in any deep learning pipelines.
