2.6. Step 5: Clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters 

The  most  suitable  number  of  clusters  from  the  previous  stage  be-
comes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each 
species  attains  several  freshness classes  based  on  its  freshness strong-
hold. We group the data using the clustering method to automatically 
determine freshness class based on the dataset. Intuitively, the clustering 
method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, 
while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters. The partitioning 
occurs automatically according to the clustering algorithm. 

2.7. Step 6: Evaluating the clustering results

we utilize 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness 
clusters for each species.

to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a 
clustering approach. For each fish, we automatically identify the num-
ber  of  classes  and  their  duration,  evaluating  them  using  the  elbow 
method. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes 
subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of our findings.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization was performed during the machine learning experiments mentioned in the text. Specifically, the researchers utilized 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness clusters for each species, which suggests they tested various configurations to determine the optimal number of clusters. Furthermore, the use of the elbow method to evaluate the number of classes and their duration indicates that they sought to minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of their findings by selecting the best configuration. Nevertheless, without specific details about the optimization techniques used, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another method was applied.
