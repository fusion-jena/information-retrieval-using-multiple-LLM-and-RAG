on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018). 

4.3. Method effectiveness

gesting  potential  improvements  over  geographic  filtering  limitations 
(Castellanos  et  al.,  2019).  However,  due  to  the  neglect  of  repeated 
presence  points  under  similar  environmental  conditions,  the  environ-
mental  variability  in  species  distribution  may  often  become  overly 
simplified  (Moudrý,  2015).  The  representativeness-oriented  method 
assigns  weights  to  presence  points  during  model  training  based  on 
assessing the representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. This 
approach addresses the issue of uneven sampling effort by emphasizing 
(i.e.,  assigning  a  larger  weight  to)  presence  samples  in  areas  where 
sampling  effort  is  relatively  insufficient.  However,  representativeness 
was assessed by comparing the distribution of environmental conditions 
at  the  sampling  or  observation  locations  with  the  entire  study  area. 
Implementing this method becomes challenging when the available data

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the representativeness-oriented method assigns weights to presence points during model training based on assessing the representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. This approach could be considered a form of monitoring model performance during training, as it adjusts the importance of certain data points based on their representativeness. Additionally, the use of two indicators - the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the distance between the observed and predicted values (D) - suggests that these metrics might have been employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it is impossible to definitively state what specific strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
