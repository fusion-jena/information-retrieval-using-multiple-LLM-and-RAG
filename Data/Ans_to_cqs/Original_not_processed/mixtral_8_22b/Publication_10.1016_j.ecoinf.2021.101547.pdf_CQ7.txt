Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Details of the parameters and settings we used for these two training 
stages are summarized in Table 1.

The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

other class(es). The network then performs a new round of learning on 
the  mini-batch  of  images—focusing  relatively  more  on  images  with 
higher  loss  scores—and  updates  its  internal  parameters,  before  pro-
ceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A 
full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 
‘epoch’,  and  the  number  of  iterations  per  epoch  is  equal  to  the  total 
number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, I can explain common practices regarding this topic.

In machine learning and deep learning projects, datasets are typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This division helps evaluate the performance of the model during and after training. Here are the purposes of each subset:

1. Training Set: This dataset is used to train the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the neural networks. During this phase, the model tries to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.

2. Validation Set: This dataset is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model, like learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc. It provides insights into how well the model has learned from the training data and if any further tuning is required.

3. Testing Set: After completing the training and validation phases, the final evaluation of the model is done using the testing dataset. This step ensures that the model can perform well on unseen data and avoids overfitting.

Regarding splitting criteria, there isn't a universally accepted rule. However, a commonly adopted practice is to use 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. These percentages might vary depending on the specific problem and the availability of data. For example, when dealing with small datasets, one might opt for cross-validation techniques instead of creating separate validation and testing sets.
