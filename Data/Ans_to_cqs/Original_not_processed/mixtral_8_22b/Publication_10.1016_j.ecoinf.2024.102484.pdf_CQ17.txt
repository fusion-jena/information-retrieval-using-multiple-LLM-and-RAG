The total area of soil degradation on HN reached 673.69 km2 in 2020 
(mainly concentrated in the northeastern region). Among the different 
land-use types, forest had the largest degraded area (439.88 km2), fol-
lowed by cultivated land (184.06 km2), construction land (25.44 km2), 
grassland (22.56 km2), and unutilized land (1.75 km2). The DEM, LDP, 
and VTem were the dominant influences on soil degradation in culti-
vated land and grassland, forest, and construction land, respectively. In 
addition,  DEM∩LDR,  LDP∩LDR, and  VTem∩VGDP  were  the  most  sig-
nificant interactive pairs influencing soil degradation in cultivated land 
and  grassland,  forest,  grassland,  and  construction  land.  The  DEM, 
especially when paired with LDR and LDP, hastens vegetation and soil 
degradation  on  cultivated  land  and  grassland.  To  protect  the  soil  re-
sources of HN, ecological protection zones should be expanded to pro-

The spatiotemporal distribution of soil degradation obtained using 
CVA is depicted in Fig. 5. In comparison to 2010, the total area of soil 
degradation on HN in 2020 reached 673.69 km2. It can be seen that the 
area of degraded soil was mainly concentrated in northeastern HN. The 
distribution  characteristics  of  degraded  soil  differed  in  central  and 
southern HN, with that in the central region being less degraded and 
relatively scattered. Degraded soil in southern HN was mainly concen-
trated in the middle of SY and the south of BT.

This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study. However, I can provide some general insights into common regularization techniques used in deep learning models.

Regularization methods are employed to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, making the model more generalizable.

Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization (also known as weight decay):

1. Dropout: This technique randomly sets a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during each iteration of training. By doing so, dropout prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

2. L2 regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.

These regularization methods have been widely adopted in various deep learning applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. While the context does not explicitly mention their usage in this particular study, these techniques remain essential tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
