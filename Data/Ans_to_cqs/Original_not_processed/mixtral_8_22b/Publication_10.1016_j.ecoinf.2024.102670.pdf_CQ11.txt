Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

to 0.29mm2. Given a set of thin binary filaments, each with a unique ID, 
eq. (1) can be applied to each filament to get its length (Fig. 15b). To 
visualize the network structure, we can consider two diverse represen-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention or reference to a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this case. The sources mentioned primarily discuss various aspects such as utilizing crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotations, examining network data, optimizing the angular branching process in fungal growth, and visualizing network structures. However, none of these directly provide a link to a data repository containing the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
