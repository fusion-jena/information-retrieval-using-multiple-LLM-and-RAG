to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

In the initial algorithm, MSNet constructs the FEN by stacking rule 
residual blocks to capture the appearance information. However, owing 
to the depth and structure of the network, the original residual network 
can only  extract  shallow  features, and  it  is  challenging  to extract  the 
deeper features of the target. The shallow network is adept at capturing 
the target’s location and appearance information, but struggles to pro-
vide detailed target information. To address the occlusion challenges in 
MOT scenarios, it is imperative to introduce deeper networks. However, 
the multiple downsampling stages in these deeper networks result in a 
lower resolution for the final feature map layer, which diminishes the 
effectiveness of the information for small targets in the output feature

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, I can provide some general insights about common preprocessing techniques used in deep learning models.

Preprocessing data before feeding it into a deep learning model is crucial to ensure better performance and accuracy. Some commonly used preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This technique scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. Min-max normalization and z-score normalization are popular methods used for normalizing input data.

2. Scaling: Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to have similar magnitudes without distorting differences in ranges or units. Techniques like standardization and min-max scaling help bring all features to a comparable scale.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries. Properly cleaned datasets improve the overall quality of the trained model.

4. Encoding categorical variables: Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form before being fed into a deep learning model. One-hot encoding and label encoding are widely used techniques for converting categorical variables into numbers.

5. Image augmentation: In case of image data, preprocessing may involve resizing images, applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to create additional training samples and prevent overfitting.
