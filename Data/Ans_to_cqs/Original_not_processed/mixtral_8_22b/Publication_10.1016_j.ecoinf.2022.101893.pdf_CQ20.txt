Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  hardware  platform  used  in  this  experiment  is  a  desktop  com-
puter with 128G memory, 16 core and 32 thread CPU, 3.40 GHz fre-
quency  and  24G  GPU.  The  operating  system  is  Windows  10  64-bit 
professional operating system. Annaconda3, PyCharm 2020.1, Python 
3.7, TensorFlow 2.6 as deep learning platform and MATLAB 2018b as 
data processing platform are exploited. Table 4 shows the labels used for 
various features. 

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two groups of 
experiments are designed for comparison and analysis. The one exper-
iment is to compare the proposed model with the classic CNN model. 
That is, using the CNN to classify the spectrums of HHT, WT and STFT. 
Another experiment is to compare the proposed model with the machine

5.2. Result analysis 

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models. 

5.2.1. Classic CNN model 

The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model, and 

their classification performance on the test set is shown in Table 6.

5.2.3. Proposed models

shown in the Fig. 6. 

The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views. 

4.2. Feature selection

sound (Bai et al., 2020). In the meantime, many scholars have adopted 
deep learning methods to extract deep features. Deep learning feature 
extraction is to obtain new deep features from the raw audio or extracted 
handcrafted  features  through  the  deep  learning  architecture.  For 
example,  Xie  and  Zhu  used  the  CNN  layers  for  learning  generalized 
features and dimension reduction, while a conventional fully connected 
layer was used to classify 14 species of birds collected from Xeno-Canto 
website. The final best F1score is 95.95% (Xie and Zhu, 2019). Liu et al. 
extracted  the  WT  spectrum  of  birdsong and  constructed a  multi-scale 
CNN to achieve birdsong classification (Liu et al., 2022).
