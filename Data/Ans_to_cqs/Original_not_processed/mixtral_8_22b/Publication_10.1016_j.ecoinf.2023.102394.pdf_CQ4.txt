keyword  search,  literature  screening,  and  data  compilation.  In  this 
database, SOCS data are organized considering depths from 0 to 20 cm 
and 0–100 cm. In this study, a set of 2207 SOCS at depths from 0 to 20 
cm from 2010 to 2014 was retrieved from the database.

The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting by introducing variations into the existing data. For instance, image flipping can create new images by horizontally or vertically reversing the original ones. Rotation involves rotating the input images by a certain degree, while scaling changes their sizes. Cropping removes parts of the images, and zooming magnifies specific areas. Shearing distorts the images along one axis, and brightness adjustment alters the overall lightness or darkness of the inputs.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but the information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline is not available in the provided context.
