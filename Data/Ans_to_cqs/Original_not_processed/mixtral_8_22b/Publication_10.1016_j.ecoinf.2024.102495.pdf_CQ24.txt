The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

of the FFT window, 1024. The feature extraction parameters that yielded 
the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase 
in optimizing the CNN deep learning model. The results of model opti-
mization  were  acquired  by  employing  identical  performance  metrics 
used in optimizing the feature extraction parameters (Fig. 13).

The CNN model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 
32,  respectively.  This  model  was  compiled  using  a  categorical  cross- 
entropy loss function, and the hyperparameters used in the CNN algo-
rithm  were  tuned  using  a  root  mean  square  propagation  (RMSProp) 
optimizer. The model generated in the training process was evaluated 
using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accu-
racy,  precision,  recall,  F1-Score,  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  score, 
confusion  matrix,  and  model  training  time  for  binary  and  multiclass 
classifications (Forman and Scholz, 2010; Grandini et al., 2020; Ouyang 
et al., 2015). The model performance needs to be evaluated to determine 
the modelâ€™s ability to classify mosquitoes, and a good model is charac-
terized by high values of predetermined performance parameters.

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, various strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds when initializing weights or other variables in the model. By setting a specific seed value, it becomes possible to reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers across different runs of the code. This ensures consistency in the results and makes it easier to compare and evaluate models.

Additionally, techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. In this method, the dataset is divided into 'k' subsets, and the model is trained on 'k - 1' subsets while being tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each subset serving as the testing set once. By averaging the results from all iterations, the impact of any single random initialization can be minimized.

Furthermore, ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can also aid in managing randomness. These approaches involve creating multiple models and combining their predictions to produce a final output. Since each individual model may have been initialized differently due to randomness, aggregating their outputs helps reduce the overall variability and improve the robustness of the prediction.

Overall, there are several ways to address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including setting fixed random seeds, using k-fold cross-validation, and applying ensemble methods. Each strategy has its own advantages and limitations, so selecting the appropriate one depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
