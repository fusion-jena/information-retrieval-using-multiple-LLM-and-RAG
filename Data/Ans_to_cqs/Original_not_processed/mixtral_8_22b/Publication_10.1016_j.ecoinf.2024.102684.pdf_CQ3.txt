of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

CNNs  have  demonstrated  a  solid  ability  to  solve  computer  vision 
problems, outperforming even human performance in image classifica-
tion  (He et  al., 2016). CNNs can be used to solve different problems, 
including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and 
instance-based  segmentation.  The  differences  between  them  mainly 
depend on the architectures, the output function, and the labeling pro-
cess. For example, the regression approach based on CNN architectures 
receives an image, and then it passes through a series of convolutional 
layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid 
output function (Lathuiliere et al., 2020). This approach is often prac-
tical and easy to interpret, as it allows direct estimation of continuous 
transitions and  patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers.  Alter-
natively, semantic segmentation, e.g. using the UNet model, has been

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. However, it mentions some common tasks in computer vision, including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and instance-based segmentation. These tasks imply various annotation methods, such as:

1. Classification: Labeling images into predefined categories, like plant species or land cover types.
2. Regression: Assigning continuous values to images, such as estimating plant coverage percentages.
3. Object detection: Identifying objects within images by drawing bounding boxes around them.
4. Semantic segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to its category, such as separating vegetation from non-vegetated areas.
5. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but distinguishing individual instances of the same category, like identifying separate trees within a forest.

Although the context doesn't explicitly mention these annotation techniques, they are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.
