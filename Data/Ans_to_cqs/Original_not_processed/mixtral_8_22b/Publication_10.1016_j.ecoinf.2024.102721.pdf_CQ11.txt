attention to the influence of extreme drought on oasis restoration within
the context of climate change. The complex structures and large
computational resources required for PBMs make it difficult to integrate
EWDP, meteorological drought, and oasis responses, hindering overall
modeling of oasis restoration under different water diversion and
climate change scenarios. Data-driven machine learning (ML) models
offer a potential solution as they do not consider complex interactions
between eco-hydrological processes but are capable of capturing highly
non-linear relationships between predictor and target variables (Chen
et al., 2022; Effrosynidis and Arampatzis, 2021). Generally, ML models
require less expertise and time to construct and often demonstrate strong
simulation performance that is challenging to achieve using PBMs
(Humphrey et al., 2016; Kratzert et al., 2018). In recent years, the long
short-term memory models
(LSTM) have exhibited unparalleled

groundwater level and hydrochemistry in the lower reaches of Heihe River
watershed, northwestern China. Hydrogeol. J. 18, 791–801.
