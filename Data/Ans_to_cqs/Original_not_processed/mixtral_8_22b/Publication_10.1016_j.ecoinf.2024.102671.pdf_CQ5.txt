5.3. Limitations and further prospects 

Certain limitations remain in the study that future research should 
address. First of all, the framework relies on a matrix that aligns carbon 
sinks  priorities  with  landscape  risks,  but  it  may  not  capture  the  full 
complexity  of  carbon  sink  dynamics.  Future  investigations  should 
further analyze natural factors, such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, 
ecosystems’  sensitivity  and  climate  change  resilience,  to  refine  in-
dicators assessing carbon sink capacity and risk. (Yang et al., 2021; Onil 
Banerjee et al., 2020). Moreover, while the MCDA methods provide a 
structured  analysis,  their  reliance  on  fixed  weights  and  scores  might 
impede their adaptability to evolving varous conditions. A more flexible 
intelligent algorithms scoring system would improve responsiveness to 
environmental  changes,  enhancing  the  framework’s  ability  to  tackle 
emerging ecological challenges (Krivoguz, 2024).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it provides several sources of geospatial data that could potentially be used in a deep learning model for analyzing ecological carbon sink risk zones. These include:

1. Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center Data Center - <https://www.resdc.cn>
2. OpenStreetMap - <https://www.openstreetmap.org>
3. Geospatial Data Cloud - <http://www.gscloud.cn/>
4. National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific - <http://data.tpdc.ac.cn>
5. Chinese Research Data Services Platform - <http://www.cnrds.com>

These resources offer various types of geospatial data, including temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross domestic product (GDP), population, food production, and other socio-economic factors. While these datasets can be useful for training machine learning models, they do not directly correspond to well-known image classification datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
