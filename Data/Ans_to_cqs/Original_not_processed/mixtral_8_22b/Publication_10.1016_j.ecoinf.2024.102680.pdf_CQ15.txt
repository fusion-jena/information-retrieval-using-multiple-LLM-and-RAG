However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

regulation. We set the batch size of all networks to 16 uniformly.

Underwater  optical  images  often  have  limited  visibility  due  to 
complex  imaging  environments.  The  SPPF  module  in  the  original 
YOLOv8  network  has  an  insufficient  receptive  field,  resulting  in  low 
recognition accuracy for underwater objects of multiple sizes. To this 
end, we propose a new LKSP module to replace the SPPF module. In the 
LKSP module, we designed three large kernel convolution branches to 
increase  the  receptive  field  of  the  network.  This  module  allows  the 
network to perceive a wider range within the image, making it possible 
to determine the category of an object from the overall perspective of the 
object  and  its  surroundings.  The  large  kernel  convolution  can  learn 
complex  underwater  object  features  in  deep  feature  maps.  These  fea-
tures  can be reused in  subsequent layers  to  improve the  efficiency of 
parameter utilization and enhance the expression ability of the model.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses several strategies employed to optimize the performance of a deep learning network for underwater object detection.

One strategy mentioned involves reducing computational complexity through the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. Dilated convolution increases the receptive field of the convolution kernel without adding parameters or increasing computational load. Depthwise separable convolution reduces computation by performing spatial convolution independently for each input channel before applying pointwise convolution.

Additionally, modifications were made to the original YOLOv8 network to address issues related to capturing accurate feature information and recognizing objects of various sizes. A new LKSP module was proposed to replace the SPPF module, which included designing three large kernel convolution branches to increase the network's receptive field. This allowed the network to perceive a wider range within the image and better recognize objects of different sizes.

While these strategies contribute to improving the performance and efficiency of the deep learning network, they do not directly correspond to traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Instead, they focus on architectural changes aimed at enhancing feature extraction and recognition capabilities while minimizing computational overhead.
