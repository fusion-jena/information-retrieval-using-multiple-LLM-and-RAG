Execution Time

All runtimes reported in this section were measured on the Google Colab repository
with a CPU running at 2.30GHz. Table 10 presents a detail of the runtime for each CNN
model. The training runtime for VGG16, Xception, and ResNet50 is 22.27, 21.26, and
30.8 min, respectively. Additionally, the prediction runtime for these models is 0.803,
0.827, and 1.835 s, respectively. The training runtime for DenceNet121 and the proposed
model is 18.34 and 16.43 min, and the prediction runtime is 4.134 and 0.976 s, respectively.
Accordingly, the computation overhead varies from one model to another. However,
PHE data are signiﬁcantly fast during both training and prediction and therefore the
computation overhead of the proposed encryption schema is low.

A comparison of the CNN models’ classiﬁcation accuracy, as obtained when trained
on encrypted images, is presented in Table 9. The results show good classiﬁcation accuracy
of all the pre-trained CNN models. As we note, DenseNet121 achieved the best accuracy
among the four models, with an accuracy of 93.36% for training, 90.93% for validation and
90.5% for testing.

Figure 9 illustrates the training accuracy of the ﬁve CNN models: both the one we
propose and the four pre-trained ones. We note that our proposed model provides better
training accuracy compared to all four pre-trained CNN models.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using three main metrics: training accuracy, validation accuracy, and prediction accuracy. These metrics measure how well the models can correctly classify or predict the target variable based on the input features. Specifically, training accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model on the training dataset, while validation accuracy evaluates the model's ability to generalize its learned patterns to new unseen data. Prediction accuracy, on the other hand, assesses the model's performance on real-world test data. In addition to these metrics, execution time was also considered as a factor affecting the overall efficiency of the models.
