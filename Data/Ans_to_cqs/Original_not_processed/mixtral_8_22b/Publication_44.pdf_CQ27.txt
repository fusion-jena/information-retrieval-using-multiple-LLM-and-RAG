Training procedure—We adapted a pre-trained VGG16 network that is a CNN trained
on the ImageNet dataset and used for transfer learning on our dataset [51]. We froze
earlier layers of the base version of the network to make them non-trainable and added an
extra max-pooling layer before the fully connected layers to reduce the dimension of the
previous layer. The feature vector of the fully connected layer was reduced from 2048 units
of the original VGG16 to 128 units, which helped in reducing the computational complexity
without sacriﬁcing much on performance. The model was implemented using Keras with
TensorFlow backend [52].

Herbarium sheet images are usually of high resolution to capture the ﬁne-grain details
of the specimens. As a standard procedure for training deep learning models, all input
images together with their annotation were resized to a 512 × 512 resolution to reduce
the computational cost during training. Rotation, ﬂipping, and brightness adjustments
were applied as augmentation techniques for better network generalization. We used
DeepLabv3+ as the segmentation model with ResNet-101 as the feature extractor. This
model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and ﬁne-tuned on the dataset. This is
useful as earlier layers of the network tend to learn generic features and therefore become
useful for other computer vision tasks [49]. We applied an Adam optimizer with a learning
rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 3. The model was trained for 100 epochs with a binary
cross-entropy loss function as we had a binary class problem (leaf or background).

threshold during training for 3000 iterations. At the end of the training process, the best
performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN
model with a NMS threshold of 0.7 during testing.

an encoder part where the model extracts potential useful features and the decoder part, which up-samples the extracted
feature map to produce the ﬁnal segmentation results.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved after the training process. This suggests that the model might have been serialized for later use. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any specific platform or method used for the actual deployment of this saved model.
