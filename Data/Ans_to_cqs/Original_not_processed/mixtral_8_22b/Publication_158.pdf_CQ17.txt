For training, the Adam optimizer was used with 500 epochs and categorical-cross
entropy loss function. Batch size was set to 64. Data augmentation was applied to enhance
sample variation and included rotation, reﬂectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of
±10% reﬂectance for 15% of the input image. To determine training convergence, we
monitored the validation data across training epochs and the network weights with the
best performance were kept. Early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was
found in 50 epochs. For CNNs, weight initialization and random selection for batch
training can lead to variability in the results. Thus, an ensemble of three models were
generated and the average of the ﬁnal output layer taken. Max pooling was used for two
models in the ensemble and average pooling for one. In initial tests using max or average
pooling showed that both provided improvement in some cases and thus could enhance

There are numerous aspects to consider for enhancing the deep-learning classiﬁer,
speciﬁcally regarding the input image size; network conﬁguration, depth, and width; and
training strategy. In initial experimentation, several standard forms of deep-learning CNN
architectures were tested based largely on ResNet [46] and Inception [63], but these did
not perform well due to the range of image objects size/scales encountered. To account
for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the
32 by 32 pixel input image, the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected.
Segmentation-based approaches were also considered as an alternative, but sufﬁcient
quality training data for segmentation was a limitation.

good performance in object-recognition tasks among others [47]. Batch normalization was
applied after all convolution or dense layers, except for the ﬁnal output. As for ResNets,
l2 weight regularization was used with a factor of 0.0001. For the ﬁnal output layer after
concatenation an eight-node dense layer with softmax activation was applied.

was cropped to sizes of 1 × 1, 4 × 4, and 8 × 8 in addition to the input of 32 × 32. We
did not include the 16 × 16 size to reduce the overall size of the network. For each size,
we developed a separate network path following a simple ResNet conﬁguration, except
for the 1 × 1 which used dense layers instead of convolution layers and no residual
connections. Residual connections in CNNs were introduced by He et al. [46]. Residual
connections force the next layer in the network to learn something different from the
previous layers and have been shown to alleviate the problem of deep-learning models not
improving performance with depth. Global average or max pooling was applied at the end
of each path and dropout layers were added in an attempt to improve generalization. The
outputs from each path were concatenated and fed into a set of ﬁnal dense layers for class
prediction. All activations were Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU), which have shown

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline employed various regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. One such method is dropout, which was implemented through dropout layers added in an attempt to improve generalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to avoid overfitting. Another technique used is l2 weight regularization, also known as Ridge Regression, which adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This helps in reducing model complexity and improving its ability to generalize. In this case, l2 weight regularization was used with a factor of 0.0001. Additionally, batch normalization was applied after all convolution or dense layers, except for the final output. Batch normalization is another form of regularization that reduces internal covariate shift, allowing faster and more stable training.
