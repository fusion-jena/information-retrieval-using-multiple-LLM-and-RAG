2.3.2.4. RF: random forest classification. With the RF approach, we used 
the “randomForest” package. We allowed the model to set the number of 
trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) by default so as 
to ensure satisfactory model performance (Duro et al., 2012; Matlhodi 
et al., 2019; Zhang and Roy, 2017). i.e. about 500 decision trees were 
created  by  the  model  under  default  settings,  with  over  3000  training 
samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings.
