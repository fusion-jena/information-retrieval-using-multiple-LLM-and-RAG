There are many questions in ecology and evolution that require
accurate identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of pollen grains. For
example, ecologists are often interested in the effectiveness of dif-
ferent pollinator species in transferring pollen to plant species,
the functional role of pollinators in networks (e.g. how gener-
alised or specialised they are); and the integration of new pollina-
tor species into communities (e.g. due to biological invasions,
climate-driven range shifts) (Tur et al., 2013; Ballantyne et al.,
2015; Thompson & Knight, 2018). Evolutionary biologists, in
turn, are interested in using paleo-pollen to reconstruct past com-
munities and climates (Harris, 1963; Marcos et al., 2015; Birks
et al., 2016), and to understand the selection pressures pollinators
impose on ﬂoral plant traits (Lankinen & Larsson, 2009; Mor-
eira-Hern´andez and Muchhala, 2019). Large-scale ecological and
evolutionary studies have been so far most limited by method-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions that the initial learning rate is set to 0.001 and then exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. This suggests that some form of learning rate scheduling has been employed during training. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine whether other methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or early stopping were also utilized for fine-tuning the remaining hyperparameters.
