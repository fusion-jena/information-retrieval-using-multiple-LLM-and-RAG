Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The context includes various land cover types such as urban areas, sparse vegetation, croplands, mosaics, and different types of tree covers. It also mentions a study about habitat factors related to wild rabbits and another one regarding empty urbanism due to the bursting of the Spanish housing bubble. Additionally, there is a reference to a limited memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization. However, none of these sources explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
