The inability to extrapolate results, the need to accumulate more and
more data and to complicate the model architecture could be related in
many cases to the complete absence of uncertainty quantification. Such
quantification would allow for an estimate of the contribution of each
individual improvement within the analyzed framework and the estab-
lishment of thresholds for process optimization (Abdar et al., 2021). The
issue of uncertainty estimation represents one of the greatest weaknesses
of Neural Networks and, in several applications, is addressed by intro-
ducing the principles of the Bayesian approach (Abdar et al., 2021; Wu
et al., 2023). Unlike deterministic models that provide point estimates,
Bayesian models make use of probability distributions to represent un-
certainty about parameters and predictions. This allows Bayesian
methods to quantitatively express confidence levels in predictions, up-
date beliefs as new data is observed, and integrate prior knowledge

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or explanation of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context alone how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
