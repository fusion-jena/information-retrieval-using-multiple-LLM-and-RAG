structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging 
the network to learn complex representations. To enhance the network's 
capacity  for  capturing  fine-grained  features  and  context,  Spatial  and 
Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture. 
These modules act as mechanisms for focusing on relevant spatial re-
gions  and  channel-wise  information,  respectively.  These  attention 
mechanisms are integrated at multiple stages in the network to enrich 
the feature representations. The decoder upscales the feature maps and 
fuses  information  from  the  encoder  using  skip  connections.  Each 
decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase 
spatial  resolution,  followed  by  batch  normalization  and  ReLU  activa-
tion.  The  final  stage  of  the  network  involves  upsampling  the  feature 
maps, followed by a convolutional layer with 4 × 4 filters to produce the

A quantitative analysis of this dataset is given in Table 5, confirming 
our  model's  effectiveness.  Our  method  has  achieved  a  UIQM  score  of 
3.26 and an NIQE score of 5.39, followed by the Funie-GAN in terms of 
UIQM with a score of 3.21 and Fusion in terms of NIQE with a score of 
5.40. While measuring the UCIQE score, IBLA achieved a score of 0.626, 
although their resultant images are just color deviations from the orig-
inal images. However, since UCIQE measures a linear combination of 
chroma, saturation, and contrast, a higher value can be expected just by 
having a change in colors (even if they are not desirable).

The network takes images with dimensions of 256 × 256 pixels and 
three  color  channels  as  input.  It  follows  a  fully  convolutional  design, 
with  each  layer  applying  2D  convolutions  using  4  × 4  filters.  Batch 
Normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation functions are used after each 
convolution  layer  to  facilitate  network  training  and  stability.  The 
encoder consists of 5 blocks, which progressively reduce the spatial di-
mensions and learn features. It starts with a convolutional layer with 32 
output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. The re-
sidual block comprises a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure, where a convolu-
tional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and 
another convolutional layer. This configuration is designed to effectively 
capture  and  enhance  image  features,  serving  as  a  critical  component 
within the network's architecture. The residual block output is then fed
