gen.de/z2/LSAspaces  (Günther  et  al.,  2015).  This  model  has  been 
demonstrated  to  generate  high-quality  performance  with  dense  word 
vectors  and  to  produce  the  best  results  regarding  semantic  similarity 
tasks (Baroni et al., 2014). This space was created using the CBOW al-
gorithm and contains vectors for 300,000 different words, covering a 
broad variety of different topics. It was trained from a 2.8-billion-word 
corpus, a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus (web pages material from . 
uk  domain;  Baroni  et  al.,  2009),  Wikipedia,  and  the  British  National 
Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007).

Word2vec  is  a  widely  known  word  embedding  technique  (e.g., 
Mikolov et al., 2013; Naili et al., 2017), and has been a successful tool for 
investigating CES from social media data (e.g., Gugulica and Burghardt, 
2023).  Word2vec  can  be  carried  out  in  two  ways:  by  creating  and 
training your own word2vec space based on two different architectures, 
namely, Skip-gram, which predicts the target word based on a nearby 
word, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), which learns to predict a 
target word according to its context (Mikolov et al., 2013), or by using 
pre-trained  models (e.g.,  Baroni et al., 2014). Training a new  custom 
word2vec model requires a very large dataset, increases the computa-
tional effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data. 
Therefore,  we  performed  the  semantic  analysis  using  the  pre-trained 
baroni  word2vec  model  provided  at  http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebin

automated,  flexible  and  transferable  data-driven  approach  using  NLP 
techniques  that  can  overcome  some  of  the  limitations  of  manual 
methods.

%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including text mining packages like 'tm', word embedding techniques such as BERT and Word2Vec, and their applications in tasks like identifying wildlife observations on Twitter and supporting cultural ecosystem service assessments. The context also mentions the use of pre-trained models, such as the baroni word2vec model, instead of training a new custom word2vec model due to the need for a large dataset and increased computational effort. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the deployment process, one cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
