feature  images  while  retaining  crucial  features.  The  Dropout  layer  is  integrated  to  mitigate 

overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

CNN architecture but  with  different  filter sizes.  The obtained  results depend on the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and the number of filters in convolution layers. The higher the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and filters, the higher the accuracy of classification. In [29], the authors 

proposed  four  different  models  for  bee  image  classification,  serving  different  tasks  in  beehive 

monitoring. All these models were based on different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have 

been  pre-trained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset  [30]  including  AlexNet,  DenseNet-201,  GoogLeNet, 

ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, VGG-19. In the first model, the authors used a transfer learning 

method based on these pre-trained DNNs. Meanwhile, in the second, third, and fourth models, the 

authors used the SVM classifier with deep features, shallow features, and deep+shallow features

Counting the number of pollen-bearing bees entering the hive enables beekeepers to monitor the 

hiveâ€™s food status and promptly replenish it if necessary. Recognizing this benefit, we integrated

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors in one study used pre-trained DNNs on the ImageNet dataset [30]. Also, they mentioned using the VnPollenBee dataset for their experiments. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline include the ImageNet dataset and the VnPollenBee dataset.
