that is, the tree species training sample and its quality. As long as the tree sample can be measured well
in ﬁeld work, deep learning networks will work well. Further, it is beneﬁcial to collect tree samples
with the aid of crowd sourcing. In terms of the sampled area in species diversity, our method is also
applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the ﬁeld work
or the requirements of species diversity estimation.

6. Conclusions

The results of this study indicate the potential of deep learning methods for applications in
tree species diversity mapping with high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. Our proposed

As VGG16 performed the best among the three deep learning algorithms, we employed the
VGG16 network at 140,000 iterations as the classiﬁcation model for tree species prediction accordingly.
All the clipped image patches of the individual trees in the three parts were fed into the trained
VGG16 network at 140,000 iterations for classiﬁcation, the results were obtained, and the tree species
distribution across the three parts is shown in Table 3. This is in line with reality: Area A has a large
proportion of banyan and silk ﬂoss trees, Area B has a large amount of Ceiba speciose, and Area C has
a large amount of longan. Overall, the proportion of all kinds of tree species in Areas A and B is
relatively balanced, while there is an obvious dominant tree species in Area C.

the number of bands of the feature maps, while the numbers on the bottom are the size (height and width) of the feature map. To avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network, we performed data augmentation on the tree samples. The tree samples in the form of patches were rotated, mirrored, and flipped randomly. Finally, a total of 5664 tree samples were used for CNN training. Scattered samples (627) and tree samples (304) in12 plots surveyed in the field measurements were used for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment (931 test tree samples in total). The 12 plots were alsoused for diversity mapping assessment.3.4.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, one strategy that can be inferred from the context is data augmentation. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples. By doing so, the dataset becomes more diverse, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. Additionally, using different subsets of the available data for training and validation can help mitigate the effects of random initialization and provide a better estimate of the model's true performance.
