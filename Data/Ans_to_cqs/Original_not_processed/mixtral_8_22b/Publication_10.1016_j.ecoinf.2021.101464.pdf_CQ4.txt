2.2. Observation content and methods

Future research should consider the changes of predictors at different 
spatial and temporal scales in order to better evaluate the explanatory 
power  of  independent  variables  in  different  climate  regions.  Such 
knowledge could then be applied to other climate region types to un-
derstand the importance level of climate region differences to selected 
variables and the overall prediction ability of the model. In addition, the 
observation  index  can  be  increased,  the  observation  time  can  be 
extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree spe-
cies can be strengthened. Big data theory and technology, neural net-
works, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods 
are applied to understand the importance level of climate differences on 
selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models, 
so as to comprehensively and systematically understand the influence of 
forest microclimate on NAI.

In order to ensure a similar process between the two methods, the 
same subset data were used to apply an RF. Before running the model, it 
was necessary to define two basic parameters in advance: the number of 
variables to try (M), and the number of trees to run (Nt), at each split. 
The parameter M was found through the internal RF function TuneRF, 
which  calculates  the  optimal  number  of  variables  starting  from  the 
default  value  and  finds  the  value  with  the  minimum  OOB  error  rate 
below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number 
of  variables  for  regression).  The  function  looks  below  and  above  this 
threshold for the value with the minimum OOB error rate. Typically, the 
value  of  M  in  the  RF  model  is  largely  based  on  empirical  formula. 
However, in this study, the alternate method of successive screening was 
used to determine the optimal parameter M, which attempts to take all

Helpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random (but realistic) transformations such as rotations, shifts, flips, brightness adjustments, etc. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of machine learning models. Some popular data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping images to create new samples. It helps the model learn features invariant to orientation.

2. Rotation: Images can be randomly rotated within a certain range to generate new samples. This technique helps the model become more robust to object orientations.

3. Scaling: Resizing images to various dimensions introduces scale variance into the dataset. This allows the model to recognize objects regardless of their size in the image.

4. Translation: Shifting images along the x and y axes creates new samples while maintaining the original aspect ratio. This helps the model learn spatial relationships between objects.

5. Shearing: Applying shear transformations distorts the shape of objects in images, making them appear stretched or compressed. This adds variety to the dataset and improves the model's ability to handle deformations.

6. Brightness/Contrast Adjustment: Altering the brightness and contrast levels of images simulates varying lighting conditions. This makes the model more resilient to illumination changes.

These data augmentation techniques can be combined and applied simultaneously during training to further enhance the diversity of the dataset. However, care must be taken not to introduce unrealistic transformations that may negatively impact the model's performance.
