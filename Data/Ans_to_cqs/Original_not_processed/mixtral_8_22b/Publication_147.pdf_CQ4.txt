1. Introduction

Machine learning—a method where a computer discovers rules to execute a data processing
task, given training examples—can generally be divided into two categories: Shallow learning and
deep learning methods [1]. Deep learning uses many successive layered representations of data
(i.e., hundreds of convolutions/ﬁlters), while shallow learning typically uses one or two layered
representations of the data [1]. Deep learning has shown great promise for tackling many tasks such as
image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, superhuman Go playing, and
autonomous driving [1–3].

CNNs 140 trained on a patch-level learn low- and high-level features from the remote sensing data. For example, 141 waterline edges which delineate marshes and open water may only need simple edge detection 142 convolution filters, while fens and bogs may be differentiated by subtle variations in texture or color 143 (i.e., visible flow lines in fens). Within the last couple of years, a number of studies have attempted to 144 use deep learning for wetland mapping in Canada over small areas and have achieved promising 145 results when compared to alternative shallow learning methods [20,51,52]. 146 With the current status of machine learning and the history of Canadian wetland mapping in 147 mind, we propose a simple goal for this study: To compare deep learning (CNN) classifications with 148 shallow learning (XGBoost) classifications for wetland class mapping over a large region of Alberta, 149 Canada (397,958 km2) using the most up-to-date, open source, fusion of data sources from

data sets: Two generated from photo interpretation and one ﬁeld validation data set. These results
will guide future large-scale spatial wetland inventory eﬀorts in Canada. If deep learning techniques
are found to generate better products, new wetland inventories projects should adopt deep learning
workﬂows. If shallow learning methods still produce comparable results, they should continue to
be used in wetland inventory workﬂow; however, deep learning architectures should still remain an
active area of research with regard to methods for wetland mapping.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was performed to increase the size of the training dataset. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to images. These techniques help improve the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting. In this case, the authors likely employed some combination of these techniques to enhance their training dataset.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but I cannot find any information regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The paper does not mention anything about this topic.
