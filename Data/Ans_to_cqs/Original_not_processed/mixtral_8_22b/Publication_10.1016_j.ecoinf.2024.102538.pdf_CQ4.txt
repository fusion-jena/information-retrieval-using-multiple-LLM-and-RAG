their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

attention mechanism; this model improved the classification accuracy. 
Tang  et  al.  (2023)  adapted  a  vision  transformer  with  hyper-head 
attention  called  Transound  for  bird  sound  recognition.  These  studies 
demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  attention  mechanisms  in  feature 
extraction.

the  two  datasets  using  the  “stratified  sampling”  method.  We  selected 
birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018, abbreviated as “BC-S" 
(BirdCLEF-Small)  and  “BC-L"  (BirdCLEF-Large).  From  the  Lishui- 
Zhejiang Birdsdata, we chose 100 bird species, referred to as “LS”. We 
then halved the number of training samples of each species for “LS” to 
construct  a  supplementary  small-scale  training  set,  denoted  as  “LS*”. 
The datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 
10% for validation, and 10% for testing to compare the experimental 
results. Detailed statistical information is presented in Table 3. 

4.2. Experimental results 

This section presents the experimental results of our PPNN model,

extraction of the short-term frame is highlighted by a red solid-line box in the waveform; the power spectrum, derived from an FFT calculation, is displayed in a blue 
solid-line box for a single frame. The fbank feature, accompanied by four data augmentation examples for the Acridotheres cristatellus sound, is visualized on the right. 
A 3-D dynamic feature is generated by stacking the zero-order, first-order, and second-order differences of the fbanks. (For interpretation of the references to colour in

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, Figure 2 does showcase some form of data augmentation being applied to the Acridotheres cristatellus sound. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a precise list of the data augmentation techniques employed in their study. Nevertheless, it can be inferred that they did utilize some form of data augmentation methods to enhance their dataset.
