1.  INTRODUCTION

The  automated  classification  of  migrating  birds'  ftight  calls  has 
the  potential  to  yield  new  biologieal  insights  and  conservation  ap 
plications  for  birds  that  vocalize  during  migration.  In  this  paper 
we  explored  two  state-of-the-art classification  techniques  for large 
vocabulary  bird  species  classification  from  flight  calls:  a  "shallow 
learning" unsupervised dietionary learning  method and  a deep con 
volutional  neural  network  combined  with  data  augmentation.  The 
models  were evaluated on a dataset of 5428  ftight  calls from 43  dif 
ferent  species, and  were  compared  against  a  baseline  model  based 
on  MFCCs.  We  showed  that  the  two  models  perform  comparably, 
yielding  a  mean  classification  accuracy  of 0.94  and  significantly 
outperforming  the  MFCC  baseline  (0.85).  We  also  compared  the 
performance of the CNN model  with  and  without augmentation and

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by removing samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from underrepresented classes.

In the context of the provided information, the authors use data augmentation [17], which is not directly related to handling data imbalance but rather focuses on increasing the amount of available data through various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This technique helps improve the performance of deep learning models by providing them with more varied examples.
