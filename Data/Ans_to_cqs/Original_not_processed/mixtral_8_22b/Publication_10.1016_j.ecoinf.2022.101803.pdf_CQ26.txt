While  the  ensemble  size  for  bagging  is  not  particularly  critical, 
provided it is sufficiently large (500 is a widely used default value), it 
does  matter  for boosting.  In  XGBoost, large  ensemble  sizes  can  cause 
over-fitting because the gradient technique focuses on the most difficult 
cases,  which  can  be  due  to  noise.  To  avoid  the  over-fitting  issue  in 
XGBoost, we use a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme. We split each 
dataset into 3 subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), 
and test set (1-fold). For each choice of number of iterations and each 
fold, we train the model on the tuning set and monitor the performance 
on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accu-
racy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This gives us k medians for each 
number of iterations, as explained in Algorithm 1 and shown in Fig. S2 in 
Supplement A.3.

regularisation, confirming similar findings in Machine Learning litera-
ture (Sollich and Krogh, 1996). The combination of the proposed RBF- 
GFR  model  with  random  forests  (RBF-GFR-RF)  produced  the  best 
model  overall,  consistently  achieving  a  place  in  the  top  three  perfor-
mance rankings. An important additional finding was that almost all the 
methods proposed in this study outperform the original GFR model from 
Matthiopoulos et al. (2011), which was the initial aim motivating the 
present work. As shown in Fig. 2, the GFR model never achieves a rank 
better than 6. R2
DEV  in Eq. (18) is generally a better behaved measure-
ment than R2  in Eq. (17) for count data as described in Section 4.2. We 
used R2
DEV to calculate the out-of-sample predictive performance in these 
datasets  as  shown  in  Fig. S9  in  Supplement A.9.  However,  the  overall 
ranks using R2
DEV  are not different from the overall ranks using R2  in Eq.

We also include a more detailed summary in Supplement A.2.

the  RBF-GFR  and  GFR  models  with  CART  methods  and,  as  a  further 
extension,  we  use  ensemble  approaches,  random  forests  (RF)  and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Ignoring structure dependence in 
data increases the susceptibility to overfitting and causes autocorrela-
tions and non-independence of model residuals (Roberts et al., 2017). 
The  block  cross-validation  approach  addresses  the  autocorrelation  of 
dataset structures (Roberts et al., 2017). We have implemented the block 
cross-validation  approach  to  account  for  autocorrelation  of  dataset 
structures.  The  simulated  dataset  in  Matthiopoulos  et  al.  (2015)  was 
simulated from multiple instances where each instance consisted of 500 
observations representing a sub-population in a different landscape. The 
dataset has a spatial structure based on these scenarios. We have used 
these scenarios as dataset blocks when we applied the models. We have

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information regarding addressing potential issues like overfitting and autocorrelations in datasets can be found.

To prevent overfitting in XGBoost, a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme is employed. This involves splitting each dataset into three subsets: the tuning set (k-2 folds), validation set (1-fold), and test set (1-fold). By training the model on the tuning set and monitoring its performance on the validation set, the optimal number of iterations can be determined without causing overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions the implementation of a block cross-validation approach to handle autocorrelation in dataset structures. This method is applied to a simulated dataset with a spatial structure based on various scenarios. Each scenario consists of 500 observations representing a sub-population in a different landscape. These scenarios are then utilized as dataset blocks when applying the models.

In conclusion, while the context does not directly discuss techniques for handling data bias during preprocessing, it highlights strategies for managing overfitting and autocorrelations in datasets, namely nested k-fold cross-validation and block cross-validation.
