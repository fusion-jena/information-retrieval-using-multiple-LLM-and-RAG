Practically, over/underﬁtting diﬃculties in neural net-
work models are caused by the neural network model’s
excessive/insuﬃcient training epochs [43]. As a result, one
possible solution to the DL-based model’s over/underﬁtting
concerns is to apply the early stopping strategy [44], which is
used to cease training when generalisation performance
starts to degrade for a number of epochs. To track the
generalisation performance,
in the proposed model, the
training data is separated into training and validation
groups.

+e dropout approach [45] is another way to deal with
the overﬁtting problem. Dropout is a regularisation strategy
that allows you to train neural networks with alternative
topologies in parallel by randomly dropping out a certain
proportion of layer neurons. Dropout is indicated by the
black neurons in the fully connected layers, as seen in
Figure 3.

gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.

Helpful Answer: The text mentions two regularization strategies to address overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. First, it suggests using the early stopping strategy, which stops training when the generalization performance starts to degrade after a certain number of epochs. This strategy helps avoid excessive training epochs that could lead to overfitting. Second, the text discusses the dropout approach, which trains neural networks with alternate topologies in parallel by randomly dropping out a proportion of layer neurons. This technique prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single feature or set of features, thus reducing overfitting. Although not explicitly mentioned, L2 regularization is also commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models.
