Fig. 1 The pipeline of the SPG framework. a Represents the original
input data (taking a tree and a pole as examples). b Is a hand-crafted
point cloud partition, c each partition is converted into a superpoint of

the SPG, and d is the network for superpoint embedding and
segmentation based on PointNet and GRU. The black lines represent

The linearity describes how elongated the adjacency is,
the planarity assesses how plane the adjacency is, the high-
scattering values are used to represent an isotropic and
spherical adjacency. We describe these three point features
as geometric features.

2. Model training: We process data with a deep neural
network and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and
volume size to output a classiﬁer for prediction.
3. Result output: The point cloud test set is segmented,
and we can obtain the ﬁnal segmentation results. The
output ﬁles include point cloud geometric partition
graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

training, we set the learning decay rate to 0.7 so that the
learning rate gradually decays as the training progresses.
Table 1 shows the experimental results in which we ﬁxed
the voxel size and batch size and adjusted the regulariza-
tion strength, from which we can be told that result is better
while regularization strength is 0.2.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. None of the given sources mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
