partitioned  the  dataset  into  ten  equal  sections,  known  as  folds,  for 
conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This methodology involves 
a cyclical process of training and testing, where one fold serves as the 
test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained 
model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance 
metrics  are  recorded.  By  averaging  these  outcomes,  we  obtain  a 
comprehensive assessment of the modelâ€™s performance. When compared 
to the benchmark model, our proposed model shows notable differences 
in  key  metrics,  including  recognition  accuracy  and  recall.  These  dis-
parities are explicitly evidenced through quantitative values and data 
visualizations.  Throughout  the  experimental  phase,  we  rigorously 
controlled for any external factors that could potentially influence the 
results, thereby enhancing the precision and reliability of our tests. In

As clearly evident in Table 3, the refined model, integrated with the 
VOS  algorithm,  outperforms  both  the  YOLOv5  and  YOLOv8  models 
across  all  evaluation  metrics,  encompassing  Box_loss,  Seg_loss,  Preci-
sion, Recall, Precision (M), Recall (M), mAP, and mAP (M).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions using a rigorous folded cross-validation methodology involving a cyclical process of training and testing. This implies that the training might be stopped based on some form of convergence or stability in the performance metrics across different folds. Commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing no significant improvement in validation loss over several epochs. Given the focus on comparing the proposed model against benchmarks like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, it can be inferred that the training was likely continued until there were no further improvements in the evaluation metrics mentioned in Table 3.
