Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

over  the others for modeling growth in the Atlantic Forest. The Nemenyi test pointed out that the difference 
between the RF model and the other techniques was greater than the calculated Critical Difference (CD). Machine 
learning can be an important tool for modeling growth in forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. They 
can help in understanding the biome and in developing management strategies aimed at recovering biodiversity 
and reducing the deleterious effects of fragmentation.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using a grid search or random search method. However, it mentions that the number of random regression trees (ntree) was tested from 20 to 100 trees, which suggests some form of parameter tuning. Additionally, the number of division variables (mtry) was set to use one-third of the independent variables by default. Lastly, the minimum size of nodes (node size) was assigned a fixed value of 5. These details indicate that the authors likely employed a manual or empirical approach to adjust these hyperparameters rather than relying on automated optimization methods like grid search or random search.
