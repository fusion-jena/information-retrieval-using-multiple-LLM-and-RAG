In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The  forecast  performance  of  deep  learning  models  varies  across 
different Chl concentration regions. In the high Chl concentration region 
(point A), the R2  values are the lowest, while in the low Chl concen-
tration region (point C), the R2 values are the highest (Fig. 6). Among the 
models,  the  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  consistently  achieves  the  highest  R2 
values  across  all  regions,  whereas  the  CNN  model  has  the  lowest  R2 
values (Fig. 6).

Although current satellite data cannot fully address these challenges, 
integrating  numerical  model  data  into  deep  learning  models  could 
improve  future  forecasts.  As  machine  learning  models  continue  to 
demonstrate substantial potential across various fields, further refine-
ment  and  optimization  tailored  to  specific  issues  are  necessary  to 
enhance the predictive performance of the Zhoushan fishery algal bloom 
forecasting model. Additionally, exploring the structural details of the 
hybrid CNN-LSTM model to understand why it performs better is crucial 
for  further optimization  and enhancing  interpretability. This  in-depth 
analysis  can  improve  the  model’s  forecasting  accuracy  and  provide 
greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of the problem. These 
pathways  are  essential  for  future  advancements  and  more  accurate 
forecasting capabilities.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the dataset. While the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing techniques used, some common methods include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: Data normalization scales the features so they have similar magnitudes, which helps prevent variables with larger ranges from dominating those with smaller ranges during training. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, where data is scaled between 0 and 1, and z-score normalization, where data is centered around the mean with a standard deviation of 1.

2. Cleaning: Removing missing or irrelevant data points ensures that only relevant information is fed into the model. Techniques such as imputation (filling missing values based on other available data) or outlier detection and removal can help maintain data quality.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns. For example, combining multiple related features into one or extracting statistical measures like means, medians, or variances might reveal hidden relationships within the data.

4. Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical form allows the model to handle non-numeric inputs. One popular method is one-hot encoding, which creates binary vectors representing each category.

While these preprocessing steps are commonly employed when preparing datasets for deep learning models, the exact requirements depend on the specific use case and the characteristics of the data being analyzed.
