Image representations extracted from deep neural networks,
trained on large datasets such as ImageNet [9] and ﬁne tuned
on domain speciﬁc datasets, have shown state-of-art perfor-
mance in numerous image classiﬁcation problems [14]. The
activation vectors of the ﬁrst fully connected layer of a pre-
trained VGGnet [24] are employed as feature representations
in our work. The weights of this deep network are ﬁne tuned
using the Benthoz15 dataset [23] which consists of expert-
annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian
seas.

labels in this dataset which make it quite challenging. Table. I
details some statistics of the Western Australia (WA) subset of
this dataset. We have used a subset of this dataset containing
images from Western Australia (WA) to train our classiﬁer.
This subset consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-
annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to
2013).

B. Pre-processing

We applied color channel stretch on each image in the
dataset. We calculated the 1% and 99% intensity percentiles
for each color channel. The lower intensity was subtracted
from all the intensities in each respective channel and the
negative values were set to zero. These intensities were then
divided by the upper percentile. The resulting intensities
achieved a better performance compared to the original ones.

C. Classiﬁcation Experiments and Results

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [9], also known as
deep networks, are an important class of machine learning
algorithms applicable, among others, to numerous computer
vision problems. Deep CNNs, in particular, are composed of
multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-
linear operators. To solve a particular task, the parameters of
networks are learned in an end-to-end manner. Image represen-
tations extracted from deep CNNs trained on a large dataset
such as ImageNet [10] have shown to produce a promising
performance for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition tasks
[11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)
[16] and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) [17] schemes
have made CNNs independent of the input image size and
robust for diverse classiﬁcation and recognition applications.
In this paper, we propose a computer vision and deep
learning based framework for the automatic annotation of

Helpful Answer:
The authors utilize a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, which contains expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This dataset has been fine-tuned using the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet. The specific method for collecting the raw data is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the data collection process likely involved underwater imagery or photography, considering the nature of the dataset and its application in marine research. Additionally, the dataset includes expert annotations, suggesting human involvement in labeling the images. Publicly available datasets like ImageNet may also have been used during the training phase of the deep learning pipeline.
