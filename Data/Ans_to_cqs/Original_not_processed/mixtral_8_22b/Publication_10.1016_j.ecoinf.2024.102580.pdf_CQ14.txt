2.3. Deep learning models 

2.3.1. Semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping

To  refine  the  predictions  and  remove  false  detections,  post- 
processing  techniques  using  the  DBSCAN  algorithm  from  the  scikit- 
learn library (v.0.24.2) were applied (Schubert et al., 2017). DBSCAN 
was successful in correcting duplicate DETR predictions, a more detailed 
description can be found in Supplementary S2D. The model underwent 
300 training cycles with a batch size of two. The learning rate for the 
(cid:0) 5 (Carion 
model backbone was set to 10
et  al.,  2020).  The  model  produced  bounding  box  predictions  and  the 
probability that these bounding boxes contained turtles. A confidence 
threshold, determining the optimal model performance, was established 
by plotting Precision and Recall against the threshold on the validation 
set.  The  chosen  threshold  balanced  the  two  metrics,  maximizing  per-
formance  by  detecting  individuals  (Precision)  while  minimizing  false 
detections (Recall). 

(cid:0) 6 and the transformer set to 10

training, which helped to reduce human error. Similar to the seagrass 
semantic  segmentation  model,  the  resolution  of  the  images  in  the 
ground-truth dataset was reduced to 1000 × 1333, and the three colour 
channels of the images were normalised by subtracting the means and 
dividing  by  the  standard  deviations  per  channel.  The  colour  channel 
means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used 
in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50 (the used mean values 
were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 
0.224, 0.225]). The DETR model’s object queries parameter was set to 
100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image, which 
was sufficient for all case-study images.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, there is some indication that a form of manual tuning or trial-and-error approach may have been employed. For instance, the learning rate for the model backbone was set to 10, and the model underwent 300 training cycles with a batch size of two. Additionally, the DETR model’s object queries parameter was set to 100. These specific choices suggest that the authors might have experimented with different configurations before settling on these particular settings. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively state whether they used methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.
