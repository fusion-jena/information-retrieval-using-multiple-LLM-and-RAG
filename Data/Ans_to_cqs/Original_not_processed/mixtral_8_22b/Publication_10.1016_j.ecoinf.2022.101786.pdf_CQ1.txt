challenge of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea.

Some model parameters were modified from the default configura-
tion to balance use of resources and training speed. We retained a res-
olution of 704 × 704, batch size 64, 32 subdivisions and trained up to 
6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to default or set according 
to guidance by the developers (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

1. Introduction 

The deep sea, by convention, the portion of the oceans deeper than 
200 m, covers most of the planet and provides many ecosystem services 
(Borja et al., 2016; Thurber et al., 2014) but is not understood as well as 
other ecosystems (Levin et al., 2019; Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010, 2011). 
As anthropogenic pressure on these ecosystems is increasing (Halpern 
et al., 2007), the international scientific community is racing to acquire 
relevant biological data to inform the development of effective conser-
vation strategies in line with the aims of the UN Decade of Ocean Science 
for Sustainable Development (Danovaro et al., 2017; Folkersen et al., 
2018; Howell et al., 2020; Levin et al., 2019; Poore et al., 2015). 

Recent research has highlighted the limitations of simple records of 
species  presence  in  the  sustainable  management  of  the  deep  sea

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets for the deep learning pipeline. However, there isn't specific information about how the raw data was collected before being manually annotated. Generally, in deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, etc. Surveys could involve using underwater vehicles equipped with cameras to capture images or videos of the deep sea environment. Sensors could include devices like sonar systems to gather acoustic data or other specialized equipment to measure physical properties like temperature, salinity, etc. Public datasets refer to existing databases containing relevant information which can be accessed and used for analysis. It should also be noted that collecting representative datasets in the deep sea poses significant challenges due to its vastness and difficult accessibility.
