For training, the Adam optimizer was used with 500 epochs and categorical-cross
entropy loss function. Batch size was set to 64. Data augmentation was applied to enhance
sample variation and included rotation, reﬂectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of
±10% reﬂectance for 15% of the input image. To determine training convergence, we
monitored the validation data across training epochs and the network weights with the
best performance were kept. Early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was
found in 50 epochs. For CNNs, weight initialization and random selection for batch
training can lead to variability in the results. Thus, an ensemble of three models were
generated and the average of the ﬁnal output layer taken. Max pooling was used for two
models in the ensemble and average pooling for one. In initial tests using max or average
pooling showed that both provided improvement in some cases and thus could enhance

There are numerous aspects to consider for enhancing the deep-learning classiﬁer,
speciﬁcally regarding the input image size; network conﬁguration, depth, and width; and
training strategy. In initial experimentation, several standard forms of deep-learning CNN
architectures were tested based largely on ResNet [46] and Inception [63], but these did
not perform well due to the range of image objects size/scales encountered. To account
for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the
32 by 32 pixel input image, the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected.
Segmentation-based approaches were also considered as an alternative, but sufﬁcient
quality training data for segmentation was a limitation.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipeline uses the Adam optimizer for training. The Adam optimizer is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments. It combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives. The use of this optimizer helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process. Additionally, early stopping criteria were applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs. This technique helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model does not continue training when it has already converged. Furthermore, an ensemble of three models was generated, and the average of the final output layer was taken. This approach helps reduce variance and improves the overall accuracy of the model.
