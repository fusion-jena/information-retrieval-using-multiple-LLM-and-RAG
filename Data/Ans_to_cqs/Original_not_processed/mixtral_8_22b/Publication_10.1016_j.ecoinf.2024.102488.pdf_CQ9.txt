2.2. Remote sensing data 

The  remote  sensing  data  utilized  in  this  study  encompassed  GF-1 

optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. 

The  GF-1  images  used  in  this  study  were  multispectral  images 
captured with a wide-format WFV camera. The GF-1 multispectral im-
ages have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial 
resolution of 16 m. The China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and 
Application (https://data.cresda.cn) was accessed to retrieve a total of 
21  GF-1  multispectral  images  (cloud  percentage  less  than  5%)  of  the 
study area in 2020 (Fig. 3). Due to the dense cloud cover, there was no 
applicable imagery for  the  months of June,  July, or August.  All  GF-1 
multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for the 
atmosphere, and registered.

The MODIS NDVI images used in this study were derived from the 
MOD09Q1 dataset (with a resolution of 250 m and an interval of 8 days). 
A  total  of  thirteen  MOD09Q1  images  in  2020  were  obtained  from 
Earthdata database (https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov). The MOD09Q1 
images were then projected into the GF-1 image and resampled to 16 m 
resolutions using nearest neighbor resampling method.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not appear that the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding where the data repository is located. However, some possible repositories for such data could include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, among others. It would be best to consult the original source of the research for more detailed information about the data repository.
