tlenecks preventing the application of deep learning for individual identification 

is the need to collect and identify hundreds to thousands of individually labelled 

pictures to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

3.  Here we describe procedures for automating the collection of training data, gen-

erating training datasets, and training CNNs to allow identification of individual

birds. We apply our procedures to three small bird species, the sociable weaver 

Philetairus socius, the great tit Parus major and the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, 

representing both wild and captive contexts.

4.  We first show how the collection of individually labelled images can be automated, 

allowing the construction of training datasets consisting of hundreds of images per 

individual. Second, we describe how to train a CNN to uniquely re-identify each indi-

vidual in new images. Third, we illustrate the general applicability of CNNs for studies 

in animal biology by showing that trained CNNs can re-identify individual birds in im-

ages collected in contexts that differ from the ones originally used to train the CNNs. 

Finally, we present a potential solution to solve the issues of new incoming individuals.

5.  Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art deep 

learning  tools  for  individual  identification  of  birds,  both  in  the  laboratory  and 

in  the  wild.  These  techniques  are  made  possible  by  our  approaches  that  allow
