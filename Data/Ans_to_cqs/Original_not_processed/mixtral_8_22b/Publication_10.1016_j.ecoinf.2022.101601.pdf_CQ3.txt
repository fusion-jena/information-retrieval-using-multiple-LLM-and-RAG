%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by K. Beall et al. The context only provides information about a Bayesian network model called PermaBN, which uses various environmental variables such as soil temperature, soil water input, and vegetation height to predict permafrost dynamics. There is no mention of any deep learning models or data annotation techniques used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
