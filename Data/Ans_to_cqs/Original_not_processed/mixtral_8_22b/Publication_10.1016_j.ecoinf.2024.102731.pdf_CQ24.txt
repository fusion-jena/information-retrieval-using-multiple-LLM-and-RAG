Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding the use of random seeds. Here are some common strategies used to manage this issue:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One simple approach is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. This ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code runs. However, it may not be ideal when exploring different models or hyperparameters since it limits the exploration of diverse solutions.

2. Multiple Runs: To account for variability due to random initialization, multiple runs can be performed using different random seeds. The results from these runs can then be averaged or compared to understand the overall performance and robustness of the model.

3. Cross-Validation: Another strategy is to employ cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation. In this method, the dataset is divided into 'k' subsets, and the model is trained on 'k-1' subsets while being tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every data point gets to be part of both training and testing sets. By doing so, we reduce the effect of randomness caused by specific train-test splits.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from several independently trained models can help mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking fall under ensemble methods. These approaches often lead to better generalization and improved performance.

5. Bayesian Optimization: Instead of manually setting hyperparameters based on trial and error, Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to find optimal values. It considers uncertainty in the search space and updates its belief about the best parameters iteratively, reducing the need for extensive manual tuning.
