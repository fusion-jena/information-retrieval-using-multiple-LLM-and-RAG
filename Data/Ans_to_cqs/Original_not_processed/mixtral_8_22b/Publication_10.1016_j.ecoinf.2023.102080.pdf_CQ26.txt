penalization (GAM-NP) (Marra and Wood, 2011), and guided regular-
ized RF (RF-GR) (Deng and Runger, 2013). These algorithms are doing 
covariate selection at the same time as model fitting, allowing to account 
early-on  for  the  specificities  of  the  algorithms  and  the  multivariate 
context. Furthermore, they have a more reasonable computational cost 
and  limit  overfitting  compared  to  dredging  or  wrapping  techniques, 
such as backward or forward selection strategies. Moreover, the three 
target algorithms are covering a gradient of fitting techniques (tree- and 
regression-based) and flexibility levels (GLM: parametric, GAM: semi- 
parametric, and RF: machine learning). A key benefit is that their co-
variate selection results are generalizable enough to be used as input for 
other popular SDM algorithms, such as Maxent (Phillips et al., 2006) or 
Gradient  Boosting  (Elith  et  al.,  2008),  even  if  they  are  not  directly 
included in the initial procedure.

2. We introduce a two-step “embedded” covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-
dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional 
candidate covariate space. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with 
three  model-specific  embedded  regularization  techniques  (Step  B),  including  generalized  linear 
model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and 
guided regularized random forest.

By combining a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific 
embedded regularization techniques, we demonstrated the abilities of 
the  two-step  “embedded”  covariate  selection  procedure  to  deliver  ac-
curate  and  parsimonious  SDMs.  Implemented  and  streamlined  in  the 
covsel R package, it offers an open and evolutive ready-to-use tool for 
automated covariate selection that was missing in the SDM field, with 
the potential to become the new standard by which to perform this step. 
Capable of dealing with covariate sets ranging from several tens to 
thousands of candidates, the covsel R package can be easily run on any 
local computer or high-performance computing cluster. Despite being 
available  for  several  decades  (Hoerl  and  Kennard,  1970;  Saeys  et  al., 
2007; Tibshirani, 1996), embedding techniques have been little used in 
SDM  studies.  One  of  their  main  benefits  compared  to  the  more

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria and then randomly selecting samples from each subset. Oversampling increases the size of minority classes by duplicating examples, while undersampling reduces the size of majority classes by removing examples. Diverse data collection aims to collect data from various sources to ensure that the training data represents different scenarios and conditions.

%Query
Query: What are the advantages of using the introduced two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure?

Answer:::
Answer: The introduced two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure has several advantages. Firstly, it combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific embedded regularization techniques, which allows it to deliver accurate and parsimonious species distribution models (SDMs). Secondly, it is implemented and streamlined in the covsel R package, making it an open and evolutive ready-to-use tool for automated covariate selection. This package can handle covariate sets ranging from several tens to thousands of candidates and can be easily run on local computers or high-performance computing clusters. Lastly, despite being available for several decades, embedding techniques have been underutilized in SDM studies. Therefore, the introduction of this procedure has the potential to become the new standard by which to perform covariate selection in the SDM field.
