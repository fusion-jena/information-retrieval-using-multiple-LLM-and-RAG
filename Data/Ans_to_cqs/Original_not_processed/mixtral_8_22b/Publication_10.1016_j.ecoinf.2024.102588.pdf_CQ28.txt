This  study  used  evaluation  metrics  to  estimate  aquatic  ecosystem 
health  indices  (Moriasi  et  al.,  2007).  The  Nash–Sutcliffe  efficiency 
(NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) 
were  used  to  measure  the  accuracy  of  the  performance  of  the  deep 
learning  models, including the  CNN model and  CNN with an  autoen-
coder, and conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, 
and  XGBoost  for  estimating  TDI,  BMI,  and  FAI  values.  The  NSE  is  a 
commonly  used  score  in  hydrological  and  environmental  models  and 
measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the 
degree  of  1:1  line  fitness  of  the  observed  versus  estimated  data  plot 
(Moriasi  et  al.,  2007;  Nash  and  Sutcliffe,  1970).  NSE  ranges  from 
negative infinity to 1, and the mean observed value is used as a refer-
ence.  In  other  words,  an  NSE  below  zero  implies  that  the  estimation

12.282, and 13.897 for the validation (Fig. 5a-f). Table 3 lists the mean 
and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE driven by the 10- 
fold  cross-validation  of  the  deep  learning  models.  The  CNN  model 
with  the  autoencoder  showed  better  estimation  performance  for  TDI, 
BMI, and FAI than the CNN model estimation without the autoencoder

data  can  be  implemented  using  the  encoded  information  of  the 
autoencoder, which concentrates the latent information of the original 
data  (Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Zabalza  et  al.,  2016).  Convolutional  neural 
networks (CNN) are deep learning architectures that have demonstrated 
outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data (Chaddad 
et al., 2021; Gupta and Bag, 2022; Ren et al., 2017). The CNN model has 
been successfully applied to the estimation of variables in aquatic en-
vironments,  such  as  water  quality  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022),  streamflow 
(Hussain  et  al.,  2020),  and  algae  (Cao  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  deep 
learning algorithms are suitable applications for sustainably estimating 
aquatic ecosystem health. Only one previous study applied a CNN-based 
approach, not to classify health levels but to augment aquatic ecosystem 
health data (Lee et al., 2021). Consequently, the deep learning fusion
