to Lab color space to boost colors and definitions. 
Lab color space approximates human vision rather than describing how 
colors should appear on digital (RGB) or in print (CMYK). According to 
Fan and Wang (2013), the translation from RGB to Lab color space is a 
two-step process. We must translate RGB space to XYZ space (Eq. (2)), 
then translate it into Lab space (Eq. (4)) using the f-function (Eq. (3)).

The  pre-processing  stage  reduces  noises  and  standardizes  inputs, 
which  enhances  metrics.  Nevertheless,  real-world  data  challenges 
robustness for any model due to registration conditions are not in con-
trol.  Therefore,  we  run  an  experimental  ablation  in  the  background 
removal algorithm to measure if the model learns by itself how to focus 

5.2. Qualitative evaluation 

Like Lee et al. (2017) and Barr´e et al. (2017), the qualitative evalu-

Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and creating confusion matrices. Saliency maps help identify which parts of the input image were important for the model's decision making. Calculating metrics helps evaluate the performance of the model. Creating confusion matrices provides insights into the types of errors made by the model.

Based on the given context, the authors have used various techniques for postprocessing their trained models. They have generated saliency maps using Guided Backpropagation (Springenberg et al., 2015) and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al., 2015) methods. They have also calculated various metrics such as train, validation, and test accuracies with raw and pre-processed datasets. Additionally, they have created confusion matrices for the VGG-19 architecture. However, there is no mention of other specific postprocessing steps such as feature visualization or error analysis.
