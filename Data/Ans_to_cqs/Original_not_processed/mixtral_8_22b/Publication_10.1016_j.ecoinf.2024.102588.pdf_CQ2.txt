Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

data  can  be  implemented  using  the  encoded  information  of  the 
autoencoder, which concentrates the latent information of the original 
data  (Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Zabalza  et  al.,  2016).  Convolutional  neural 
networks (CNN) are deep learning architectures that have demonstrated 
outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data (Chaddad 
et al., 2021; Gupta and Bag, 2022; Ren et al., 2017). The CNN model has 
been successfully applied to the estimation of variables in aquatic en-
vironments,  such  as  water  quality  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022),  streamflow 
(Hussain  et  al.,  2020),  and  algae  (Cao  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  deep 
learning algorithms are suitable applications for sustainably estimating 
aquatic ecosystem health. Only one previous study applied a CNN-based 
approach, not to classify health levels but to augment aquatic ecosystem 
health data (Lee et al., 2021). Consequently, the deep learning fusion

Batch normalization and dropout layers were adopted to assist in the 
feature extraction of the convolutional layers. The feature generalization 
of  the  input  mini-batch  was  performed  by  calculating  the  mean  and 
standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate 
shifts  (Cooijmans  et  al.,  2016).  Overfitting  of  the  CNN  model  was 
reduced  using  a  dropout  layer  that  inactivates  random  nodes  that 
contain learnable weights (Ashiquzzaman et al., 2018). Fully connected 
layers  obtain  processed  features  using  convolutional  operations  for 
classification  or  regression  tasks.  CNN  model  training  adjusts  the 
weights  by  conducting  backpropagation,  whereas  the  loss  function 
minimizes  the  error between  the observed and  estimated results.  The 
gradient  descent  algorithm  iteratively  updates  kernel  weights  by 
calculating the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each

wi,new = wi,old (cid:0) α

∂L
∂wi,old

where wi,new  is the updated weight of the ith convolutional layer; wi,old  is 
the old weight of the ith CNN layer; α is the learning rate; and L is the 
loss function. 

This study used water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data as 
CNN inputs to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices (Fig. 2b). The 
manifold features of the autoencoder were utilized as inputs for the CNN 
model (Fig. 2b). These data or features were originally divided into 70% 
(334  data  points)  and  30%  (144  data  points)  training  and  validation 
datasets, respectively. A one-dimensional CNN was adopted because of

12.282, and 13.897 for the validation (Fig. 5a-f). Table 3 lists the mean 
and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE driven by the 10- 
fold  cross-validation  of  the  deep  learning  models.  The  CNN  model 
with  the  autoencoder  showed  better  estimation  performance  for  TDI, 
BMI, and FAI than the CNN model estimation without the autoencoder

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data as inputs for the CNN model. This suggests that the data could be in a numerical format, possibly stored in a structured file like a CSV. Additionally, the use of a one-dimensional CNN implies that the data might be represented as vectors rather than images, videos, or other multi-dimensional formats.
