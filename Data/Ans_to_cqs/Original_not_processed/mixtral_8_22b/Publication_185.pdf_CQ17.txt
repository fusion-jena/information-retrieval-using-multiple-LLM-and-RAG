Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate

Helpful Answer:
In this context, two regularization methods are mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. In this case, the dropout ratio is set to 0.5. On the other hand, L2 regularization is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting. Here, L2 weight decay with a penalty multiplier set to 5 × 10^-4 is applied. These techniques help ensure that the deep learning models can generalize well even when trained on small datasets.
