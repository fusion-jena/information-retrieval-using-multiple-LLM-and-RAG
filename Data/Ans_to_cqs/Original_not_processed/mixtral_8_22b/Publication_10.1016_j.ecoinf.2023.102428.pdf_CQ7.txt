2.3. Research design and data processing 

The research workflow of the study is organised into three stages, 
viz., data processing and classification, change detection and prediction, 
and  valuation  of  C  sequestration.  At  the  first  stage,  pre-processing  of

each layer is a neuron that operates on non-linear activation function, 
such as  sigmoid. These  neurons are  organised in such a way that the 
networks are directed only from lower to upper layers, and the neurons 
within  the  same  layer  are  independent.  Input  data  is  provided  to  the 
input node, processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, 
and  the  output  layer  provides  the  pattern  classification.  The  Markov

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of how the data was split for training, testing, or validation purposes in the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that the dataset was divided into training and testing sets based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning models. Typically, the dataset is randomly partitioned into two subsets: one for training the model and another for evaluating its performance. A commonly used ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing. In some cases, a third subset called the validation set may also be created to fine-tune hyperparameters during the training process. Without further details about the specific methodology employed in this study, we cannot provide more precise information regarding the splitting criteria used for their deep learning model.
