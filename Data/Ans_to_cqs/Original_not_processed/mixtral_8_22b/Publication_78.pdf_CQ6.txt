3.1. Explanation of Steps

Initially, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone. In the next step,
the image is segmentized and divided into small patches. Features are extracted from
each patch with the help of handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. A visual vocabulary

(VV) is created, as shown in Figure 4, this visual vocabulary is the features extracted
from these features, and the training features are passed to classiﬁer i.e., SVM, which
classiﬁes whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral. We used different
handcrafted features as well as different D-CNN’s but AlexNet shows the highest accuracy.
We used different classiﬁers i.e., SVM, kNN, and decision tree, but SVM outperforms all
other classiﬁers.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. These steps aim to prepare the input data so it can be effectively processed by the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input data to have a mean of zero and unit variance. This helps ensure that each feature contributes proportionately to the final output, preventing any single feature from dominating the results due to its scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of values within a certain limit, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This can improve the convergence speed during training and prevent numerical instability issues.

3. Cleaning: This process removes noise, missing values, or irrelevant information from the input data. For example, removing duplicate entries, handling missing values using imputation methods, or filtering out unnecessary features.

4. Augmentation: To increase the amount of available training data, various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc., can be applied to the existing images. This technique helps improve the generalizability of the trained model.

5. Encoding: When dealing with categorical variables, they need to be converted into numerical representations. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding can be employed based on the nature of the variable.

The choice of preprocessing steps depends on the characteristics of the input data and the desired outcome. Not every step might be necessary for every scenario; hence, careful consideration should be given while selecting appropriate preprocessing techniques.
