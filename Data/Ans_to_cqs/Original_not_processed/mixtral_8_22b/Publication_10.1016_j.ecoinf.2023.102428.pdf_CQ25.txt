2.5. Model description 

2.5.1. MLPnn-MC modelling 

MLPnn-MC  modelling  integrates  the  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) 
algorithm  and  Markov  chain,  which  unravels  robust  future  LULC 
simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The novelty of 
this model lies in the fact that it utilises deep machine learning to learn 
the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, 
multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions 
and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by compre-
hending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). MLP is 
the  most  prevalent  machine  learning  algorithm  in  ANN  (Artificial 
Neural Network) modelling (Alla et al., 2021; Band et al., 2020), which 
uses  back  propagation  (BP)  or  the  reverse  method  of  automatic

each layer is a neuron that operates on non-linear activation function, 
such as  sigmoid. These  neurons are  organised in such a way that the 
networks are directed only from lower to upper layers, and the neurons 
within  the  same  layer  are  independent.  Input  data  is  provided  to  the 
input node, processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, 
and  the  output  layer  provides  the  pattern  classification.  The  Markov

differentiation as a feedforward propagation (FP) algorithm to train the 
neural networks by employing supervised learning based on stochastic 
gradient descent (SGD). Backward pass always improves the efficiency 
of MLP neural networks. Generally, MLP consists of three main layers of 
nodes: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in- 
between them (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). Apart from the input layer,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model described in this context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the structure of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network mentioned, we can infer that its primary use might be for pattern recognition or classification tasks. This is because the MLP network has an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, with each layer containing neurons operating on non-linear activation functions like sigmoid. Additionally, the table shows that the output layer provides pattern classification, further supporting the idea that the model could be used for classification purposes.
