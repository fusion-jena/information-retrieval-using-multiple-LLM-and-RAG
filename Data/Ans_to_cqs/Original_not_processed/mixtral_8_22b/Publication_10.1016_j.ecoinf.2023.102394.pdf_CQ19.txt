2.3.2. Model development 

We  modeled  the  relationship  between  SOCS  and  environmental 

covariates using a general predictive function: 

SOCSi = f (R, PM, S, Ci, Bi)

(4)  

where R is the topography, PM is the parent material, S is the soil var-
iable, C is the climate, and B denotes the biota variable. 

We used a deep learning algorithm, namely, the multilayer percep-
tron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. This algorithm is a type of feedforward 
artificial  neural  network  (Bishop,  1995)  comprising  an  input  layer, 
multiple hidden  layers, and  an output  layer. The  input layer  receives 
features (environmental covariates) that are used for prediction, and the 
hidden layer hides the extracted features, while the output layer yields 
the  prediction  results  (SOCS).  Except  for  the  input  layer,  each  layer 
consists  of  a  set  of  individual  nodes  (neurons).  Each  node  connects 
adjacent layers via the activation function. The MLP technique develops

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it mentions that a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) was employed for SOCS modeling. While this information doesn't directly indicate the use of popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these frameworks do support building models with MLP architectures. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another similar framework could have been utilized to construct the MLP model. Additionally, the reference section includes a citation for TensorFlow, but it remains unclear if TensorFlow was specifically used for this particular study.
