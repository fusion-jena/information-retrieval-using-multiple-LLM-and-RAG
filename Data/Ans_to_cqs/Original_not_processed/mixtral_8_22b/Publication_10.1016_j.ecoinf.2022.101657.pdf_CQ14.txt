7.1.3. Bespoke neural networks for species sets 

While we selected a suitable neural network for species identifica-
tion, we spent little research so far to train this network to sets of user- 
selected  or  prevalent  species  in  the  region  where  the  camera  trap  is 
deployed.  Training  for  a  bespoke  set  of  species  is  both  possible  and 
desirable. Further research is needed to identify and automate a process 
that,  given  a  set  of  species  of  interest,  outputs  a  robust  and  reliable 
neural network model with suitable weights.

As a major application of this system is low-power devices, it is useful 
to determine which pipeline configuration is the most power-efficient. 
The  power  consumption  can  be  split  into  the  following  components: 
system  idle  (2.20  W)  –  when  our  software  is  not  running;  motion 
filtering (additional 1.55 W) – the pipeline idle state; and animal filter 
(additional  2.50  W)  –  due  to  the  animal  detection  model  running,11 
which adds up to 6.25 W. The only component of power consumption we 
have  control  over  with  the  different  pipeline  configurations  is  the 
number of animal filter runs. To indicate how this maps to a real-world 
deployment we have determined an average power consumption for the 
dataset. To do this, the animal detector power consumption is multiplied 
by  the  proportion  of  dataset  frames  that  are  run  through  the  animal 
detection  model.  Note  that  the  peak  power  consumption  will  be  the
