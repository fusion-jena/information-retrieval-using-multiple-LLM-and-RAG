ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. The context only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the model based on the provided context.
