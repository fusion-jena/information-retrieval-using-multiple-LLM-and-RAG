The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

limitation  of deep neural networks, and one of their few aspects that 
may be viewed as inferior to classical machine-learning algorithms and 
rule-based  image  analysis: whereas  the  user can exert  a  high level  of 
control over the predefined variables at the basis of the latter (e.g. the 
yellowish tint could be designated as a requisite criterion), there is no 
way to control precisely what CNNs learn ‘under the hood’ (Ball et al., 
2017). At most, the user can carefully select and manipulate the training 
images to attempt to influence the network to learn particular charac-
teristics and/or assign more importance to certain characteristics than 
others.

other class(es). The network then performs a new round of learning on 
the  mini-batch  of  images—focusing  relatively  more  on  images  with 
higher  loss  scores—and  updates  its  internal  parameters,  before  pro-
ceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A 
full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 
‘epoch’,  and  the  number  of  iterations  per  epoch  is  equal  to  the  total 
number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts fitting the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the layer look-like and train many independent networks within itself. This forces the network to spread out the learned weights among multiple neurons, reducing the dependence on any single neuron and thus preventing overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty term, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize both the original loss function and the sum of squared weights, effectively shrinking the weights towards zero. This results in simpler models with smaller weights, which are less likely to overfit the training data.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two popular regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout achieves this by ignoring random neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to shrink the weights towards zero.
