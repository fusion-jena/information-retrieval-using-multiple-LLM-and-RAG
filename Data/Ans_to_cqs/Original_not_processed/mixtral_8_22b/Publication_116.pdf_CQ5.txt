1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several papers related to deep learning and computer vision, including [31], which discusses going deeper with convolutions, and [33], which delves deep into rectifiers for surpassing human-level performance on ImageNet classification. Additionally, [34] introduces Caffe, a convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding, and [36] explores going deeper in the automated identification of herbarium specimens. While these sources do not explicitly mention the use of popular datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, they suggest that datasets like ImageNet may have been employed due to their relevance to image recognition tasks. Nonetheless, without more specific details from the context, we cannot definitively state which datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
