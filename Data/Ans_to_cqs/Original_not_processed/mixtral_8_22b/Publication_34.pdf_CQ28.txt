SNN, DNN and CNN models are ﬁtted with the package mxnet: All model

average slope of the training mean loss had an absolute difference to 0 on the last 100

epochs inferior to 10−
DNN, and 5 h for CNN (independently of the version).

10.2.4 SDM Based on a Convolutional NN Model

A convolutional NN (CNN) can be seen as a extension of NN that are particularly
suited to deal with certain kind of input data with very large dimensions. They
are of particular interest in modeling species distribution, because they are able to
capture the effect of spatial environmental patterns. Again, we will ﬁrstly describe
the general form of CNN before going to our modeling choices.

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
