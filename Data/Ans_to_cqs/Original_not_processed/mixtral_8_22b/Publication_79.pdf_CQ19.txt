Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models for classifying Brazilian Savanna physiognomies or segmenting satellite images. However, some clues can be found from the cited works and references. For instance, the U-Net architecture mentioned in reference [27] by Ronneberger et al. has been implemented using various deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. Similarly, the DeepLabv3+ variants referenced in [24] have also been implemented using TensorFlow. Therefore, it is possible that these frameworks were used in building the deep learning models discussed in this work. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state which frameworks were employed.
