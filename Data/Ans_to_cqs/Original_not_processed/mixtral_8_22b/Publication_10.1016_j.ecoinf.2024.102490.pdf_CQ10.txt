records were initially subjected to manual filtering (to remove points 
with missing information, typing errors, located in the middle of the city 
or with evidence of being cultivated plants), followed by spatial filtering 
(to retain only one record per ~5 km2) using the Raster package (Hij-

correlation. Records comprising material deposited in herbaria up to the

Among the ten climatic variables, Bio04 (Temperature Seasonality) 
and Bio14 (Precipitation of Driest Month) contributed the most to the 
prediction of climatic suitability for all the species; Bio17 (Precipitation 
of Driest Quarter) was shown as the third environmental variable as it 
was present in three of the four species (Table 4). The relative contri-
bution of Bio04 and Bio14 was >32% for all species, with Bio04 being 
the largest contributor.
