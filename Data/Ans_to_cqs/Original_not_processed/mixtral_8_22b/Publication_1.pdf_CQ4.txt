Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Data exploration 

Data  exploration  is  required  at  the  initial  phases  of  the  analysis 
process.  Analysts sort and filter the data according to date ranges, 
time  of  day,  or  site  location.  Additionally  and  importantly,  they 
also  apply  conditionals  regarding  the  elemental  attribues  of  the 
signals. For example, for audio signals, analysts can sort the data 
frequency ranges, click-like or whistle-like sounds, rising tones or 
falling  tones,  repetitive  pulses,  and  so  on.  Visually,  one  can 
specify  fast  or  slow  moving  objects,  large  or  small  objects,  the 
presence  of  eye-shine,  and  certain  colors.  Modalities  are 
combined as well. For example, images can be selected according 
to time periods when a specified sound occurs. These exploration 
tools have proven critical for rapidly building datasets to train DL 
models  for  new  species,  and  for  finding  novelty  in  the  data  for

However,  the  rise  of  cheap  and  powerful  sensors  has  created  an 
ever-increasing data glut.  To be effective, these new tools must be 
coupled  with  new  automated  approaches  to  processing  and 
analyzing wildlife data streams. 

Here we describe examples of how we are leveraging advances in 
the areas of big data and deep learning to help researchers extract 
meaningful  information  from  the  torrent  of  new  sensor  data,  and 
improve the adaptive management of natural systems.

4.2.Data analysis

DL  grew  out  of  the  fields  of  representation  learning,  neural 
networks,  and  computational  neuroscience.  It  employs  trainable 
computational  models  composed  of  a  potentially  large  stack  of 
processing layers. Each layer learns a more abstract representation 
of  the  data  based  on  the  more  elementary  representation  in  the 
previous  layer.  For  instance,  in  image  recognition,  the  first  layer 
commonly  represents  any  image  by  its  low  level  visual  features 
such as local edges or gradients. Subsequent layers can be seen to 
combine these low level features in various combinations to form 
corners or textures. In the deepest layers, semantic representations 
are  formed  related  to  the  specific  task  at  hand.  For  example,  in 
face  recognition,  there  forms  a  representation  of  eyes  and  noses, 
and then combinations of those in various geometric relationships,

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses the use of deep learning in biodiversity research, specifically in image recognition tasks like face recognition. Deep learning models often employ data augmentation techniques to improve their performance and generalization capabilities. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones. Commonly used techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. While the context does not provide explicit details about which data augmentation techniques were used, it is reasonable to assume that some combination of these techniques was likely employed during model development and training.
