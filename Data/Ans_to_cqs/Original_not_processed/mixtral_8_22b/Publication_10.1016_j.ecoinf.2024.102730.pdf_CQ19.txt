Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

Unfortunately, MLPs are black-box models. This means that, while
they can approximate any function, it is nearly impossible to determine
the structure of the approximated function. This led to a whole new field
within ML, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), which tries to create
methods that allow human users to understand the predictions made by
an ML model (Vilone and Longo, 2021). Some popular examples include
sensitivity analysis (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014), Local Interpretable Model-
Agnostic Explanations (LIME) (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and SHapley Ad-
ditive exPlanations (SHAP) values (Lundberg et al., 2017). This study
uses the last method, as it is gaining in popularity and is now often used
in ecology. For example, Masago and Lian (2022) use SHAP values to
investigate how inter-annual variation in the daily average temperature
affected the first flowering date or the full blossom date of the Yoshino

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework(s) used to build the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in the field, some possible frameworks could be TensorFlow or PyTorch, as they are widely used for building deep learning models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). It should be noted that without explicit information from the source material, this remains speculative.
