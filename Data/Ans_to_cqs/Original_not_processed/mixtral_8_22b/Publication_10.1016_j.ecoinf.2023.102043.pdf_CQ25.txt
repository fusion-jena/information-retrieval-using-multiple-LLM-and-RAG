model for extracting the embeddings. 

These are pulled from YAMNet and then fed as input to a sequential 
and  a  reduce  mean  layer  mapping  to  the  classes  mentioned  above 
(Ntalampiras et al., 2021). At this point, the final layers of the network 
map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels as shown in Fig. 5.

3.2.2. Transfer learning based on YAMNet 

The second algorithm exploits the representation extracted from a 
deep neural network, i.e. YAMNet, which is pre-trained on data coming 
from 521 classes. Interestingly, YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convo-
lution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus (Shor 
et  al.,  2020).  Towards  using  YAMNet,  the  audio  data  is  processed  as 
follows:  

1.  The audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 

16 kHz.  

2.  The spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 

25 ms overlapped by 15 ms.  

3.  The Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel 

scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.  

4.  Finally, the algorithm is applied and its outcome is passed to YAMNet

are fed to a Random Forest (RF) classifier learning rules associating the 
input features to the final classes.

oped  two  solutions  for  detecting  goat  vocalizations:  a)  one  based  on 
handcrafted features and a traditional machine learning algorithm, and 
b)  one  relying  on  the  deep  network  YAMNet  designed  to  facilitate 
generalized sound recognition applications. 

3.2.1. Traditional machine learning 

In the first algorithm, the detection of goat vocalizations is based on a 
wide  variety  of  temporal  and  spectral  audio  features  (Mel-Frequency 
Cepstral  Coefficients,  Root  Mean  Square,  Spectral  Centroid,  Spectral 
Bandwidth, Spectral Rolloff, and Zero crossing rate (Alas et al., 2016;

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is utilized to map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels, which suggests that it is being used for multi-class classification. This is further supported by the mention of a Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is also typically used for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is primarily used for classification purposes in this context.
