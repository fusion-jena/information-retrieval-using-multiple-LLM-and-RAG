et al., 2005). The field station's local vocabulary was mapped to in-
ternationally recognized controlled vocabularies, with strong content
governance models. Controlled vocabulary terms from FishBase (Froese
and Pauly, 2010), the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS
Editorial Board, 2020), and the Interna tional Council for Exploration of
the Seas (ICES) were used to ensure interoperability and transparency
(Table 1). The model allows the physical repository to be adapted to
accommodate various laboratory storage systems.

4.2. Data model & vocabularies

the procedures involved in storing, uploading metadata, and imaging
samples, a high-level process flow was developed (Fig. 3). The process
flow outlines where the sample metadata is generated, analysed, and
eventually stored. Furthermore, it documents how the physical samples
and digital data are linked. This cross-disciplinary process flow is novel
because it outlines how the operational part (routine sampling of fish
for government mandated stock assessment) of an organization (the
MI), and the research capacity of an organization (imaging and reading
growth on scales and otoliths), can be interlinked. Additionally, the
management of the IFBA dataset follows the procedures and roles
outlined within the MI's Data Management Quality Framework
(Leadbetter et al., 2019).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model allows the physical repository to be adapted to accommodate various laboratory storage systems. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
