findings requires careful consideration and evaluation within the spe-
cific context of each geographical region. Despite achieving high per-
formance,  our  study  was  constrained  by  limitations  in  resources  and 
time,  which  resulted  in  a  narrow  focus  on  specific  forest  samples.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used in the studies mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken for this purpose based solely on the provided context.
