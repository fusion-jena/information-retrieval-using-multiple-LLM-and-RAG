1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These include setting a fixed random seed value before training the model to ensure reproducibility, using cross-validation to evaluate model performance, employing ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting to reduce variance, and applying regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning, as discussed in Probst et al. (2019), can help optimize model performance and mitigate the effects of randomness.
