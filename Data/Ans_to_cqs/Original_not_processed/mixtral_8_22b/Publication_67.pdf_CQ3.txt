(1) Database construction phase: ﬁve training datasets were built with examples of images with
diﬀerent levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of auxiliary
class “Non-Forest” (see Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material, Archive S2).

(2) Training phase: training ﬁve CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization

techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation (see Section 2.3).

(3) Classiﬁcation phase: classiﬁcation of new 396 images with diﬀerent tree cover in global drylands
(see Supplementary Material, Table S1 and Archive S3) with the built CNN-based model (see
Section 2.4).

(4) Validation phase: assessment of performance on the new images (see Section 2.5).

2.2. Datasets Design

Before building the training datasets for the CNN-based models, we compiled a global database

of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources:

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or classification was performed during the database construction phase, where five training datasets were created with examples of images having different levels of tree cover. This suggests that the images might have been labeled according to their respective tree cover levels. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques during the training phase indicates that pre-existing models and additional synthetic data may have been employed to improve the accuracy of the CNN-based models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the actual data annotation methods applied, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it is difficult to definitively state which techniques were utilized in this particular case.
