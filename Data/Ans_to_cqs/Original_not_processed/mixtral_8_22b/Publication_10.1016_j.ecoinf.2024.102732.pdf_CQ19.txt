2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

regression. In: 2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and
Automation (ICCCA). IEEE, pp. 1–4.

parameter combination, enhancing the model’s performance. Important
indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include “Gain” and
“Frequency” (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Meh-
mood et al., 2024a; Ryu et al., 2020). SVR tuning involves selecting the
appropriate kernel function and optimizing the “C” parameter, which
balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of
SVR allows it
to handle complex decision boundaries effectively
(Yudong Li et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015).
