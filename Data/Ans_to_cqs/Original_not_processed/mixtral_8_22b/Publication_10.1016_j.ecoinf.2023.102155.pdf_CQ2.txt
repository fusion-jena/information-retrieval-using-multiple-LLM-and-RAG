3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

Loop  methods  but  the  Mixture  methods  perform  worse  in  meanRSS 
when lasso is not implemented. With a lasso penalty used, adding bias 
correction  does  not  greatly  change  the  meanRSS  performance  of  the 
Mixture methods.

= (cid:0) 0.55, ρ2(cid:0) 3

=0.17, ρ1(cid:0) 3

= (cid:0) 0.025.

intensity for the least abundant species (Species 3; Figs. 3 and 4). Knn, 
CoinF (CF), individual (indiv in captions) and LoopT do not overcome all 
the observer bias from the road network, even with the bias correction. 
On the other hand, LoopA predicts the same intensity distribution for all

3.1.1. Relabelling performance measure 

Fig.  1  shows  the  performance  in  classification  as  measured  by 
meanRSS for Test 1 for the best-performing methods across the combi-
nations  of  lasso  penalty  and  bias  correction  use.  The  relative  perfor-
mances of the methods in relabelling are similar regardless of the use of 
a  lasso  penalty or  bias  correction  for  a  low  percentage  of  hidden  ob-
servations.  Indeed,  we  note  that  methods  like  LoopT  and  knn  are 
competitive with the individual method. However, we can emphasize 
that adding the lasso regularization results in better performances—i.e. 
lower meanRSS—especially at 80% of hidden observations for the badly 
performing  methods  (kmeans,  random,  CoinF,  LoopA  and  LoopE) 
(Fig. 1). Adding bias correction does not change the performance of the

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine what specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files were utilized in this case.

Based on the available context, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing and comparing various methods for predicting intensity distributions using lasso regularization and bias correction techniques. These methods include knn, LoopT, LoopA, CoinF, kmeans, random, LoopE, and others. The performance of these methods was evaluated based on their ability to accurately classify and predict intensity distributions, as shown in figures 1 through 6.

However, there is no mention of any specific data format being used in this analysis. It could be possible that the input data consists of numerical values stored in a structured format such as CSV, but without further context, it is impossible to confirm this assumption.
