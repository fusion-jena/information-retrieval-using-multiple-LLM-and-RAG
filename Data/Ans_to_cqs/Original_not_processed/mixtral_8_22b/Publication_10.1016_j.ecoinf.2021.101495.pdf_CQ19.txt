2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016). 
In particular, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow 
and  pre-trained  with  the  ImageNet  dataset  (training  parameters  in 
Table  2).  A  problem  encountered  in  initial  tests  related  to  species

the classification model with a total of 86,208 segments. Fig. 7 shows 
how the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if 
data augmentation is used.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the base models have been obtained from TensorFlow Object Detection API (for segmentation) and the base implementation of TensorFlow (for classification). Additionally, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow is mentioned for fish classification by species. Therefore, we can conclude that TensorFlow is the primary framework used to build the deep learning models in this study.
