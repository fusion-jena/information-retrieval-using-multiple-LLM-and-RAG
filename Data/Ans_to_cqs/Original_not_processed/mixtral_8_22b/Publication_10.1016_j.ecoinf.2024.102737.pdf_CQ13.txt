performance of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
showed that the CNN outperforms the traditional classification methods.
Salman et al., (2016) compared traditional classification methods such
as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbours (K(cid:0) NN), and Sparse Representation
Classifier with CNN. They achieve an average classification rate of more
than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 (Joly et al., 2014) and LifeCLEF15 (Joly
et al., 2015) fish datasets using CNN and generally a significantly lower
rate using the traditional methods. Siddiqui et al., (2017) reaches clas-
sification accuracy of 94.3% performance on fish species classification
using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach for enhanced
discriminative ability to handle the limited labeled training data prob-
lem. Nepovinnykh et al., (2018) examine two methods of Saimaa ringed
seal identification based on transfer learning: retraining of an existing
convolutional neural network (CNN) versus using the CNN trained for

Though the original architecture of Koch et al., (2015) used
regularized cross entropy as a loss function, better performance may
be achieved with other loss functions instead of cross entropy, as
mentioned by Wang and Deng, (2021). Contrastive loss takes as input
a pair of samples that are either similar or dissimilar, and brings
similar samples closer and dissimilar samples far apart. It is, there-
fore, a better choice for learning a metric. Contrastive loss has been
successfully used recently in several papers in machine learning as
well as with Siamese networks and outstanding results have been
reported for using it even in unsupervised contrastive learning (see e.

%Query
Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. However, common hyperparameters used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, etc.), batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, momentum, and others depending on the specific model architecture and problem domain. For example, Salman et al., (2016) mention achieving high classification rates using a CNN but do not specify the exact hyperparameters used. Similarly, Siddiqui et al., (2017) report a high classification accuracy using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach without providing details on the hyperparameters employed. Therefore, further research would be required to determine the specific hyperparameters used in these studies.
