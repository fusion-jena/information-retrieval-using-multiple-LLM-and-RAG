For each growing step, we apply a probability function, typically a 
normal distribution, in all directions. This results in a probability-based 
growth effect towards a preferred direction while allowing for a certain 
degree  of  randomness.  At  each  step,  we  only  permit  unary  or  binary 
branching to neighboring vertices. To control the overall size of the root, 
we  employ  a  global  radius  Rgrow  to  limit  the  accumulated  Euclidean 
distances from the starting root vertex to the farthest leaf vertex (Fig. 6). 
We demonstrate this algorithm with more examples in Section 5.1.

In response to the escalating significance of environmental concerns, 
fostering interdisciplinary integration is crucial for the development of 
innovative and comprehensive solutions. The imperative for educating 
professionals across diverse fields in enhancing dialogue beyond their 
respective  disciplines has never been more pressing. As  landscape ar-
chitects  and  researchers,  we  have  engaged  in  numerous  projects  that 
encompass a broad spectrum of disciplines, acknowledging the pivotal 
role of soil science within various ecological systems. Through collab-
oration with experts in disciplines such as soil science, ecology, water 
management, and urban planning, we have recognized the need for a 
coherent communication approach that efficiently conveys information 
across  these  fields.  Accordingly,  this  paper  proposes  a  visualization

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that one strategy to manage randomness is by applying a probability function, often a normal distribution, during growth steps. This allows for a degree of randomness while still maintaining a preference for a particular direction. Additionally, limiting the overall size of the root system through a global radius helps maintain some level of control over the process. While these strategies may not directly relate to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, they illustrate how incorporating probabilistic functions and setting boundaries can help manage uncertainty and randomness in computational processes.
