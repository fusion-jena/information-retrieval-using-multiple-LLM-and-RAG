retrieved  local  climate  data,  envisions  potential  avenues  to  exploit 
existing  remote  sensing  data  and  web-based  APIs.  For  instance,  the 
utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US 
soil moisture data can be beneficial. This could lead to the development 
of integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at 
varying degrees of granularity. Not only would this augment the inter-
operability of our system, but it would also foster enhanced multidis-
ciplinary  communication  at  the  developmental  stage,  consequently 
bolstering  collaborations  across  fields.  Nevertheless,  the  prospect  of 
identifying a unified data framework with global applicability remains 
uncertain to us.

In the realm of visualization, the chosen approach often depends on 
the target audience and the format of the source data. Given the limited 
literature on soil visualization outside of soil mapping, we conducted a 
broader  survey  of  this  topic  within  the  general  environmental  and 
ecological context. A significant portion of such research falls into the 
data  visualization  category,  which  utilizes  data  obtained  from  various 
survey  methods  to  reveal  targeted  information.  Techniques  such  as 
reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization are 
employed to transform data into a format that highlights the intended 
information.  The  results  of  these  studies  are  often  code  libraries  in 
conventional data science programming languages (Python or R), which 
users can utilize and build upon (Araya et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2022;

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of existing remote sensing data and web-based APIs, specifically referencing the resource Crop-CASMA for US soil moisture data. It suggests the possibility of developing integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at varying degrees of granularity. Additionally, it discusses the potential benefits of identifying a unified data framework with global applicability, although uncertainty exists regarding its feasibility. Unfortunately, without more explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact datasets utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
