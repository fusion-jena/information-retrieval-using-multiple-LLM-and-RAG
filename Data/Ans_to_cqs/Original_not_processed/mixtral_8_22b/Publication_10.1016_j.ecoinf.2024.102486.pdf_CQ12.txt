the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine

2.  A CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance should be created on Google Cloud. Various choices are available by searching for ‘CUDA’ in the 
Google Cloud ‘Marketplace’. We recommend a VM named “Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97”, as it comes with the necessary drivers 
and compilers pre-installed. At the time of writing, this instance uses CUDA 11.6. Documentation is available if additional information about 
similar Google Cloud VMs is required.  

3.  The VM can be launched using the ‘Launch’ button on the aforementioned page, after which the required hardware specification of the VM must be 
selected. For most small projects, 16GB of memory and an SSD boot drive of 30GB should suffice. The number and type of GPUs can be selected at 
this stage.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the mentioned tools and applications.

For instance, the text mentions the use of the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools support various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others.

Moreover, the context refers to typical machine learning applications involving recognition and classification of visual images or acoustic recordings. CNNs are commonly used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features. On the other hand, RNNs are often used for sequential data like speech or music signals, making them suitable for processing acoustic recordings.

However, without more specific details, it is impossible to definitively state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. It could be any of these models or even a combination of different types depending on the specific requirements and design of the system.
