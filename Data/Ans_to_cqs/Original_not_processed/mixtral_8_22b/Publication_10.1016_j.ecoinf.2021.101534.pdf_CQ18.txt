the two-step process that we demonstrated in the case study. Further-
more,  during  this  multi-step  process,  the  initially  inferred  sounds 
reviewed by experts can be fed back into the training data, which helps 
collect training data for rare species.

The  standardized  recordings  are  then  segmented  into  clips  with  a 
fixed duration. There has to be a trade-off between a short clip which 
may include only part of a sound of some species and a long clip which 
increases  the  requirement  of  computing  time  in  model  training.  We 
segment recordings into 3-s clips because the duration of most sound 
classes in our database is less than 3 s. Kahl et al. (2021) used the same 
clip length in their model for identifying the sounds of 984 bird species 
in North America and Europe.

3.4. Model training and evaluation 

3.4.1. Model training 

We  used  YOLOv5s,  the  smallest  weight  of  YOLOv5,  to  build  the 
sound identification model. The model was trained for 100 epochs with 
32 batch size and the input image dimension 640 × 640. We used default 
data  augmentation  including  scaling,  color  space  adjustments,  and 
Mosaic  augmentation  during  the  training  process.  Under  this  setting, 
four  original  spectrograms  were  randomly  selected,  resized,  cropped, 
color jittered (i.e., changes in hue, saturation and exposure) and then 
merged into one big input image for model training. The model training 
was performed using a workstation equipped with the following speci-
fications: Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 
8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe 
SSD * 2. 

3.4.2. Model inference and test datasets

The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input 
images for model training. The clips are transformed by applying the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 sam-
ples,  hop  size  of  400  samples  (75%  overlap),  and  240  mel-scale  fre-
quency bins.  Each spectrogram thus  has a height  of 438 pixels  and a 
width of 436 pixels (Appendix S1: Fig. S4a).

Helpful Answer:

From the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, several strategies could have been employed. These might include tracking metrics such as loss or accuracy over each epoch, visualizing the learning curves, or evaluating the model on validation sets periodically throughout the training process. In this case, the model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 x 640. Default data augmentation techniques like scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation were also applied during the training process. It would be reasonable to assume that some form of monitoring was conducted to ensure optimal performance and prevent issues like underfitting or overfitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
