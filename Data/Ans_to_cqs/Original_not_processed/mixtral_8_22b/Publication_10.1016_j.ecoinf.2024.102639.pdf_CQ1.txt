5.3.3. Results analysis and comparison 

The integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classification  algorithms  (see  (Bansal  et  al.,  2022; 
Boateng  et  al.,  2020)),  along  with  a  Principal  Component  Analysis- 
Support  Vector  Machine  (PCA-SVM)  hybrid  approach  (Hai  and  An, 
2016), has significantly enhanced our understanding of zebrafish and rat 
movements within T-maze environments. This comprehensive analysis, 
as  detailed  in  Tables  3  and  4,  showcases  the  detailed  insights  gained 
from these methodologies. For zebrafish, the KNN model demonstrated 
high precision and recall in identifying left movements, with impressive

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods include using sensors, conducting surveys, or utilizing publicly available datasets. In this case, we cannot determine which method was employed without further context.

Based on the given context, it is not possible to directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general methods for gathering such data include using sensors, conducting surveys, or employing publicly available datasets. Without additional context, we cannot definitively state which method was used in this particular study.
