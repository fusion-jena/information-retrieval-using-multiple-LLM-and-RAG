5. Conclusion

Potapov30m was derived using GEDI, Landsat and SRTM data and a 
regression tree algorithm. It has spatial resolution of 30 m and is valid 
for  the  year  2019.  The  estimate  of  GEDI  canopy  height  used  in  the 
models represents the 95th percentile of energy return height relative to 
the ground (RH95). To select the highest quality training and validation 
data they used for the modelling only observations collected in power 
beam mode, during the night, and with beam sensitivity 0.9. In addition, 
they  excluded  observation  collected  during  the  leaf-off  season  in 
temperate and boreal forests. 

Validation of Potapov30m using ALS data performed by the authors 
themselves showed ME of (cid:0) 3.8 m, RMSE of 9.07 m, and MAE of 6.36 m

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the Potapov30m model. However, it mentions that the authors used a regression tree algorithm, which often involves monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy to decide when to stop training. Common stopping criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, early stopping based on no improvement in validation loss/accuracy over several epochs, or achieving a target performance level. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the training process, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete for this particular model.
