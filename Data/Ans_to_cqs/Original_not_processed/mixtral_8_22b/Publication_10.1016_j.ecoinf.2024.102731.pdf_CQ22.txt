Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

portional to permeability, so the following scoring scale was used: very
low – 0.00, low – 0.25, medium – 0.50, high – 0.75 and very high: 1.00.
Once these values were set, they were converted into raster format to
enable determining the mean scores per climate pixel.

%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to permeability, Mann-Kendall metric, Sen's slope, and p-values. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
