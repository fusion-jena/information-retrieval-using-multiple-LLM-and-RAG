Figure 9. Schematic diagram of the evaluation process.

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

2.2.2. Evaluation Metrics

3.2. Computational Complexity

This section compares the methods in terms of computational efﬁciency and computa-
tional load for training and inference. Table 2 presents the average training and inference
times measured on the hardware infrastructure described in Section 2.2. Considering that
the methods were trained with the same optimizer and learning rates, these results are
highly correlated with the network depth and the selected batch size. For instance, the
DDCN network is deeper than the others, and the consequence is that it took longer than
the other networks for training and inference.

The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

3.3. Visual Analysis

Some features maps, learned by the convolutional layers, are presented in Figure 12.
Speciﬁcally, this image presents low-, mid- and high-level feature maps learned by the
ﬁrst, a middle, and the last layers of the networks, respectively. We can see the each CNN
performs very differently from one another.
