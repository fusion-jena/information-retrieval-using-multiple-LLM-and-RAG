Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The model parameters were tuned to increase model accuracy. Some 
model  parameters  or  hyperparameters  were  varied  to  evaluate  the 
performance of the given model. The model with the best performance 
was selected from several other models with different parameter vari-
ations.  However,  parameter  tuning  was  limited  to  a  few  hyper-
parameters  because  of  the  large  number  of  parameters  in  the  CNN 
model. The model parameters that varied were the optimization algo-
rithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. The following are

Helpful Answer:
Based on the information provided, it appears that the authors used a combination of various hyperparameter settings to find the best performing model. They experimented with three different optimizers (RMSProp, Adam, SGD), two learning rates (0.001, 0.01), and both with and without dropout layers. This suggests that they may have employed a form of manual search or grid search to explore these combinations. However, the exact methodology used is not explicitly stated in the provided text. Therefore, while we can infer that some form of systematic exploration of hyperparameters was conducted, the specific technique remains unclear.
