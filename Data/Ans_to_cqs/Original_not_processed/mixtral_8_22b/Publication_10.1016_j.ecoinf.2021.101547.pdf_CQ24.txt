The  mini-batch  size  is  user-adjustable  (typically  in  binary-number 
increments,  e.g.  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  etc.)  depending  on  the  data  set.  Too 
small  a  mini-batch  size  may  provide  insufficient  image  data  for  the 
network  to  meaningfully  learn from  some or  all  of  the  classes  within 
each iteration, while too large a mini-batch size may cause the network 
to  overfit  to  the  training  images.  Because  of  the  high  computational 
complexity  of  the  deep  learning  process,  the  mini-batch  size  is  ulti-
mately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU (in our 
case 8 GB), factoring in the size of the images (in our case 224 × 224 
pixels × 3 bands) and the number of internal parameters in the network 
(25.6 million in the case of ResNet-50). Thus, we were limited to mini-

2.4.1. Background training images 

To train the CNN on the large diversity of background throughout the 
aerial survey imagery so as to minimize misclassification of background 
features as polar bears, we randomly selected 6092 photos (~10% of the 
full  set),  excluding  the  20  photos  known  to  contain  bears.  We  then 
cropped  each  photo to  224  × 224  pixels  at a  random  location in the 
photo to match the CNN's input size. We additionally randomly selected 
and  cropped  another  1000  photos  from  the  full  set  to  serve  as  back-
ground validation images to assess the network's classification accuracy 
throughout training.

batches of 64 images. Smaller mini-batches were not desirable in our 
case  because  of  our  significantly  imbalanced  training  image  set  that 
required both a large variety of background images and a certain min-
imum  number  of  polar  bear  images  in  each  mini-batch  (see  section 
2.4.3). The precise numbers of training images of various sorts that we 
used at different stages of training our CNN were calibrated to ensure 
that the total number of training images was divisible by 64, so that no 
images were excluded from each training epoch. 

2.3. Collection and editing of Web images of polar bears

The  diversity  of  considerations  and  possibilities  for  improvement 
highlights another general challenge of using deep learning at present: 
as a still-burgeoning technology, optimized or standardized approaches 
for different analysis tasks are not yet well-established, so the range of 
possibilities  can  seem  overwhelming,  especially  to  non-expert  users. 
Even the basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1, are 
numerous and highly technical. A sensible approach is to initially set 
options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis 
tasks,  then  attempt  to  refine  certain  settings  through  trial  and  error. 
However,  it  should  also  be  noted  that  the  computationally  laborious 
process of training a CNN (several hours to several days of background 
processing) imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that 
can  be  undertaken.  Nevertheless,  deep  learning  is  now  clearly  over-

In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are implicit strategies used to manage variability and improve performance.

One strategy mentioned is adjusting the mini-batch size during training. Mini-batch sizes are typically increased in binary increments (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.). This allows for better management of resources and helps prevent issues like underfitting or overfitting due to small or large batch sizes, respectively. In this case, the mini-batch size is ultimately limited by the GPU's memory capacity and the complexity of the deep learning model being used.

Another strategy involves selecting and preparing training and validation datasets. To train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on diverse background features, 6092 photos were randomly selected, excluding those containing bears. Each photo was then cropped to 224 x 224 pixels at a random location to match the CNN's input size. Additionally, 1000 more photos were randomly selected and cropped to serve as background validation images. These steps help introduce variability into the dataset and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Lastly, the text mentions the use of image manipulation and augmentation techniques. While specific methods aren't detailed, these techniques generally involve applying transformations to existing images to create new ones, thereby increasing the overall dataset size and introducing further variability. Examples include rotating, flipping, zooming, and changing brightness levels.

Although none of these strategies directly address managing randomness via random seeds, they do contribute to creating a robust and varied dataset, which indirectly mitigates the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
