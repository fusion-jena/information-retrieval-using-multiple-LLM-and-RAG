Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Modeling  was  performed  by  generating  1000  random  pseudo- 
absence points and splitting the collected data into training (80%) and 
testing (20%) datasets (Huang et al., 2023; Pant et al., 2021; Salinas- 
Ramos et al., 2021). To avoid sampling bias, pseudo-absence points were 
generated  three  times  for  each  model  and  cross-validated  per  model 
using bootstrapping (Carvalho et al., 2021). We evaluated and compared 
the performance and accuracy of each model using AUC (area under the 
receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic) (Araújo and New, 
2007).  True  skill  statistics  value  changes  between  (cid:0) 1  and  + 1,  with 
positive values indicating a perfect fit, while AUC values range from 0.5 
to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive 
power (Fielding and Bell, 1997).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These may include:

1. **Metrics Calculation**: This involves calculating various metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistic (TSS), precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance and accuracy of the models. The text mentions that AUC and TSS were used for this purpose.

2. **Cross Validation**: Cross validation is often used to ensure the robustness of the model. It involves dividing the dataset into subsets and validating the model on different combinations of these subsets. The text mentions that cross-validation was done using bootstrapping.

3. **Confusion Matrix**: This is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class.

However, it should be noted that the specific postprocessing steps can vary depending on the type of model and the problem being addressed. For instance, saliency maps might not always be relevant or necessary. They are typically used in deep learning models to understand which parts of the input had the most influence on the output. Since the context does not mention anything about deep learning or image data, it seems unlikely that saliency maps would have been used here.
