Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

To solve the problem of high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences, we introduce
a deep learning model to extract useful features and classify ﬁsh from different families,
which is effective and robust.
To address the problem of overﬁtting caused by small dataset due to the limited
number of species in the family, the Elastic Net is introduced for the proposed method
to improve the generalization ability.

• We employ EN-SAE model to receive the outgroup scores. The decision threshold is
automatically learned by the KDE technique. A novel predictor is proposed based on
the outgroup scores, while other classiﬁcation studies often omit the importance of
automatic learning threshold.

• We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method, and the results show
that the ESK model outperforms four commonly used machine learning methods.
The effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed model for ﬁsh classiﬁcation
is demonstrated.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Regularization helps to reduce this issue by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging complex models and promoting simpler ones. Some common regularization methods include:

1. Dropout: This method randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively creating a thinned network. It prevents any single neuron from having too much influence on the output and encourages the network to distribute its weights evenly among all neurons.

2. L2 Regularization (also known as weight decay): This method adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. By penalizing large weights, it encourages smaller, more distributed representations, reducing the risk of overfitting.

3. Early Stopping: This method involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping the training process once the validation error starts increasing. This prevents the model from continuing to fit the training data beyond what is necessary, thus avoiding overfitting.

4. Elastic Net: This method combines both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a balance between feature selection and shrinkage. It allows for automatic feature selection and promotes sparsity in the learned representation.

In the given context, the authors use Elastic Net to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. They mention that Elastic Net improves the generalization ability of their proposed model and solves the overfitting problem encountered when working with small datasets. Additionally, they note that Elastic Net provides sparse connections, saving training time, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data like genetic characteristics of species.
