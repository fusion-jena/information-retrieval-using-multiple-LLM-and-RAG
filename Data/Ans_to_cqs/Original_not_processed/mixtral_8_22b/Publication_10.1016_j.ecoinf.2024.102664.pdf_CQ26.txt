Although current satellite data cannot fully address these challenges, 
integrating  numerical  model  data  into  deep  learning  models  could 
improve  future  forecasts.  As  machine  learning  models  continue  to 
demonstrate substantial potential across various fields, further refine-
ment  and  optimization  tailored  to  specific  issues  are  necessary  to 
enhance the predictive performance of the Zhoushan fishery algal bloom 
forecasting model. Additionally, exploring the structural details of the 
hybrid CNN-LSTM model to understand why it performs better is crucial 
for  further optimization  and enhancing  interpretability. This  in-depth 
analysis  can  improve  the  model’s  forecasting  accuracy  and  provide 
greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of the problem. These 
pathways  are  essential  for  future  advancements  and  more  accurate 
forecasting capabilities.

Algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022 were evalu-
ated using various deep learning models, as summarized in Table 3. The 
hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  demonstrated 
superior  performance 
throughout  the  year,  achieving  the  highest  values  for  POD  and  HSS 
compared to other models. Notably, the LSTM model outperformed the 
CNN model. The Zhoushan fishery exhibits pronounced seasonal varia-
tion in algal blooms, with the highest occurrence in summer, totaling 
8468 bloom days, followed by Spring with 4720 bloom days. Among all 
seasonal forecasts, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved 
the  highest  HSS  values.  Specifically,  during  the  peak  algal  bloom 
occurrence in summer, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model excelled with both 
POD and HSS at 0.32. In contrast, during winter and autumn, the hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model displayed lower HSS values, primarily due to elevated 
FAR.  Across  all  model  forecasts  and  seasonal  variations,  the  POCR

Helpful Answer:

While the given context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general methods can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning.

Data bias can be addressed through several techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from different sources or populations to reduce bias and increase the representativeness of the dataset.

In the case of algal bloom forecasting for the Zhoushan fishery, addressing data bias might involve collecting data from multiple locations within the fishing area, considering temporal variations, and employing appropriate sampling strategies to ensure the dataset accurately represents the diversity and complexity of the environment. However, without explicit information about the preprocessing steps taken in this study, it is impossible to determine which specific techniques were employed to address data bias.
