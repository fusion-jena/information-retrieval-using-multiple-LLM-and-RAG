4.3. Advantages and drawbacks 

4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

on identifying a complete set of environmental parameters related to the 
species’  subsistence  (Pearson,  2007).  Therefore,  parameter  selection 
methods are often used before ENMs (Bargain et al., 2017; Coro et al., 
2013a;  Coro  et  al.,  2015b;  Coro  et  al.,  2015c;  Guo  and  Liu,  2010; 
Magliozzi  et  al.,  2019;  Muscarella  et  al.,  2014;  S´anchez-Tapia  et  al., 
2017; Schnase et al., 2021; Warren and Seifert, 2011; Zeng et al., 2016). 
ENMs use statistical analysis, machine learning, or expert-defined rules 
to  estimate  the  species’  ecological  niche  as  a  predictive  function  be-
tween  habitat  suitability  conditions  and  the  input  environmental  pa-
rameters.  One  input  to  an  ENM  is,  therefore,  a  set  of  environmental 
parameters related to species’  subsistence in the analysis area, homo-
geneously defined on the area at a specific spatial resolution (Alvera-

learning.  AUC  close  to  1  indicates  high  model  quality,  whereas  0  in-
dicates  low  model  quality.  We  used  AUC  to  select  the  optimal  hinge 
features and checked that all models used for species richness estimation 
reached a least a 0.75 AUC. This check contributed to result reliability. 
We  applied  MaxEnt  to  all  our  selected  species  and  environmental 
data (Fig. 3-a). Therefore, we produced 180 models for each of the seven 
analysis years (180 × 7 = 1260 models) (Fig. 3-b and c). We represented

Query: "What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that MaxEnt was applied to all selected species and environmental data, but it does not specify any details regarding the configuration or tuning of this method.
