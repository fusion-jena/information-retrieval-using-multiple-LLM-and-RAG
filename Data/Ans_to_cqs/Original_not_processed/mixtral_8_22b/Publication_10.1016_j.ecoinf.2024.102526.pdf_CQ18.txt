comparisons (including sample 
units, replicates, etc.) 
A description / definition of the 
planned spatial extent of the study

captured), including boundaries and 
reasons for constraints (e.g. 
scientific, practical), may connect to 
‘target habitat’ below 
Survey bounding box 

A description / definition of the 
planned temporal extent, including 
boundaries, rationale for duration/ 
frequency, and reasons for 
constraints (e.g. scientific, practical)

A general description of the aims 
and objectives of the study, as they 
pertain to biology and method 
scope. This should define the 
primary and secondary data to be 
measured and to what precision. 
A description of the target organisms 
for observation, and any biological 
or methodological constraints (e.g., 
taxonomic level of identification, 
size-based, behaviour, mode of life, 
sex, life-stage, etc.) 
Link to target species in WoRMS 
(those within scope, not just those 
found) 
Scope of observations: quantitative, 
semi-quantitative and/or qualitative

Query: "What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The information provided does not contain details about a specific machine learning project or monitoring strategies for model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based on the given context. However, common strategies used to monitor model performance during training include tracking metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, confusion matrices, etc. Cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross validation can also be employed to evaluate the model's performance across different subsets of the dataset. Additionally, visualization tools like TensorBoard or matplotlib can help plot these metrics over time to observe trends and identify potential issues like underfitting or overfitting.
