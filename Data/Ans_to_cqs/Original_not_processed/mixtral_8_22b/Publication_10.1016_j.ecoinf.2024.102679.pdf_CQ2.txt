surveys of PAs covering thousands of square kilometers and generating 
thousands of images can be delayed by several months using the OCC 
approach due to the slow but necessary manual processing of images. 
Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  propelled  the  perspec-
tives of remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 
2022),  and  announced  good  prospects  for  the  automation  of  image 
processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom 
et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL) is a subgroup of machine learning and 
artificial intelligence (AI) where artificial neural networks are trained to 
achieve challenging tasks (e.g. detect animals in aerial imagery) through 
a complex multi-level representation of information learned from a large 
amounts of data (LeCun et al., 2015). In the last decade, DL has been 
widely  employed  to  (semi-)automate  the  detection  and  counting  of

190,686 images were saved in 6000 × 4000 pixels JPEG format, from 
which 148,239 appeared on transect after cleaning. All images were geo- 
referenced  in  UTM  coordinates  using  the  GeoSetter2  software  which 
associated the altimeter's GPS tracklog to the exact acquisition time of 
each image. 

2.4. Deep learning model 

The DL architecture HerdNet3  (Delplanque et al., 2023a) has been 
selected  for  processing  the  aerial  survey  images  given  its  attractive 
performances on a previous SRF-OCC study (Delplanque et al., 2023b). 
HerdNet is a single-stage fully convolutional neural network built with 
two heads: one dedicated to the accurate point detection of animals in 
the image and the other to their classification.

2.5. Image processing 

Images have been processed through the use of the DL model coupled 
with  human  manual  interpretation  steps.  This  ‘human-assisted’  DL- 
based  image  processing  pipeline  has  been  designed  to  minimize 
human effort while maximizing the quality of counting results. In the 
following sections, this approach is referred to as the Semi-Automated 
Deep Learning (SADL) model, and SADL-OCC refers to the integration 
of  the  SADL  model  with  the  OCC  technique.  This  section  therefore 
presents the main components and steps of this developed approach.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
In the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the text mentions that there are 190,686 images saved in 6000 x 4000 pixels JPEG format. These images are then processed using the HerdNet deep learning architecture, which is specifically designed for processing aerial survey images. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
