2.3. Deep learning model development 

CNN possesses robust capabilities for image feature extraction and is 
recognized as an effective tool for addressing image recognition chal-
lenges (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Lei et al., 2019). It has also found 
applicability in the domain of time series signal processing (Gautam and 
Singh, 2020; Li et al., 2021). The CNN network architecture comprises 
convolutional  and  pooling  layer,  which  are  the  two  principal  hidden 
layers responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN.

CNN  and  LSTM  model  (Fig.  4–7).  The  hybrid  model  combines  the 
strengths of CNN and LSTM networks, offers significant advantages over 
using either network alone.

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning models developed in this study use segmented images as their primary data format. These images are created by dividing larger images into smaller segments or grids, each containing 9 pixels. The segmentation process involves iteratively moving a window pixel-by-pixel across the original image. The resulting segmented images serve as inputs to the deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The CNN model uses these segmented images to extract features and perform tasks such as image recognition, while the LSTM model processes sequential data, including time series signals from the segmented images. Therefore, the main data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is segmented images.
