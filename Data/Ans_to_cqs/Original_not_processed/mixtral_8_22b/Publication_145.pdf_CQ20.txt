as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model was trained using the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory. This information can be found in section 3.7 Algorithm of the given context. It states that the model was coded in the programming language R with RStudio interface to Keras and TensorFlow backend. Furthermore, it mentions that the training of the models took ~2--20 hours using the mentioned GPU. Therefore, we can conclude that the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.
