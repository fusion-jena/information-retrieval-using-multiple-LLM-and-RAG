%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, etc., can be applied during training to increase the size of the dataset and improve model performance. However, without more details about the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to, it cannot be determined which data augmentation techniques were applied.
