• We  use  structural  re-parameterization  techniques  to  decouple  the 
training  structure  from  the  inference  structure.  This  enables  inde-
pendent optimisation of the training and reasoning stages. Moreover, 
it enables the training phase to capture more feature information, 
while  the  inference  phase  simplifies  the  model  structure,  thereby 
reducing computational costs and deployment difficulties. 

• A  dual  improvement  in  model  performance  and  efficiency  is  ach-
ieved by replacing the fully connected layer in traditional classifiers 
with convolutional layers and simplifying the model under structural 
re-parameterization.

In view of this discovery, we re-examined the application strategies 
of deep learning, no longer pursuing model complexity but exploring the 
potential  of  shallow  networks.  Through  meticulous  algorithm  optimi-
sation  and  structural  design,  we  strive  to  maintain  the  model  perfor-
mance while reducing the computational complexity  and deployment 
costs,  achieving  a  balance  between  speed  and  accuracy.  The  specific 
contributions of this study are as follows:  

• We propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilises AlexNet as the 
backbone,  fully  exploiting  the  performance  of  minimalist  models. 
Ensuring a good balance between speed and accuracy. 

• The  method  of  cascading  multiple  activation  functions  fully  in-
troduces  nonlinear  factors  such  that  the  model  approximates  the 
nonlinear  expression  function  of  the  learning  features  while  also 
improving the gradient propagation.

AlexNet is a deep CNN. Its structure can be divided into three main 
parts: conv-block, max-block and classifier. The conv-block comprises a 
series of convolution layers, normalisation layers, and activation func-
tion layers. It extracts features from the input data and captures local 
features through convolution layers. The normalisation layer is used to 
accelerate training and prevent overfitting, while the activation function 
layer  uses  the objective  function  to  increase  the nonlinear  expression 
ability of the model. The max-block module is located behind the conv- 
block.  Through  the  down-sampling  operation,  the  size  of  the  input 
feature map is decreased, effectively reducing the amount of data while 
retaining the essential features, thus reducing the amount of calculations 
of the model. Second, it can increase the robustness of the model and 
make it more adaptive to input characteristics. A classifier is a crucial

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the dataset with relevant information required for training machine learning or deep learning algorithms. For example, bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images, which helps train object detection models. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class, enabling the creation of detailed maps of scenes. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing individual instances of objects to be identified and labeled separately. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes within images, useful for tasks like autonomous driving. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects, often used for pose estimation or facial recognition. Landmark annotation involves identifying specific features within images, commonly used for face alignment or tracking. In summary, various data annotation techniques exist, depending on the task requirements and desired output.
