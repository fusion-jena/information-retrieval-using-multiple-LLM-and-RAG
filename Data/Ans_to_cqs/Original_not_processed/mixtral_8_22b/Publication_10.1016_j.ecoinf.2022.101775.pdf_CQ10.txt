Consequently, the unknown parameters bs, bt, ps, qt can be estimated 
optimizing  the  regularized  cost  function  using  stochastic  gradient 
descent:

2.2. Embedding layers 

(5)  

Embedding  layers  are  modules  of  deep  neural  networks  that  are 
generally  implemented  in  natural  language  processing  problems 
(Sharma  et  al.,  2020)  and  collaborative  filtering  (He  et  al.,  2017) 
because they can solve the one-hot encoding problem (Yu et al., 2022), 
where the latent representations in the classic models are composed of 
sparse representations generally using vectors mainly composed of zero 
layers  replace  such  dispersed  vectors  with 
values.  Embedding

Lastly, according to (Fan and Cheng, 2018), the model presented in 
Eq.(13) is finally known as DMF. In this case, it will be called DMF1 and 
used to reconstruct the non-observed representations n in matrix M. 

2.4. Variations of the proposed DMF model 

This  section  presents  the  design  of  three  DMF  models  that  can 
complement the DMF1 model (see Fig. 2) by including spatial-temporal 
features,  which  vary  the  dimension  d  of  the  embedding  layers  in 
accordance with the information to be represented. In this sense, the aim 
of this proposal is to consolidate an approach to reconstruct signals that

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing the deep learning pipeline mentioned. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it would not be possible to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
