Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

67%. R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) described identifying bird 
species  based  on  their  vocalization  or  call  by  the  spike-based  neural 
networks.  The  dataset  contains  the  vocalizations  of  14  different  bird 
species,  recorded  by  the  Central  Poultry  Development  Organization 
(CPDO)  in  Bhubaneswar,  India,  using  a  digital  recorder  and  a  unidi-
rectional microphone.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
