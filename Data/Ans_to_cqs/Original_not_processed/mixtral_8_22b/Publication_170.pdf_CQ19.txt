Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

At present, few researchers focus on time costs of model
training and the required computing platform. Yousif et al.
(2019) stated that they optimized their model performance,
but model training still failed to complete on a common PC.
In terms of recognition rate, their rate on a 2.6 GHz CPU
computer was 100 frames/minute, which is lower than our
recognition rate (260 images/minute). One possible reason
is that their preprocessing was more complex.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Our method can greatly reduce time and personnel costs in
3 ways. First, using our method to automatically ﬁlter empty
images can greatly save labor and time, and the percentage
of the labor and time savings is the same as the proportion

memory, we used the incremental training mode to train
and test the DCNN model. On another Dell PowerEdge
C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB
of memory, we used the zero‐start and the incremental
training modes to train and test models, respectively.

RESULTS
The incremental training mode performed consistently with
the zero‐start training mode when the training sample size

STUDY AREA
Our study area (28°14′‐28°22′N, 99°4′‐99°17′E) was located
at the Baimaxueshan Mountains (BMXSM), which were
part of the Hengduan Mountains in China (Fig. 1). The
Hengduan Mountains region, also known as the Mountains
of Southwest China, was identiﬁed as a global biodiversity
hotspot (Myers 1988, 1990, Myers et al. 2000). The altitude
changes from about 2000 m to higher than 4600 m above
sea level.

METHODS

Adaptive Incremental Training Method
To reduce the demand for computing resources for
model training, we proposed an adaptive incremental
training method (Fig. 2). In our method, we carried the
training process of the DCNN model in stages. The
model training starts with a smaller training set, and
then the trained model can be applied to the practical
ecological
In practical applications,
users can expand the previous training set by adding

survey project.

Model Evaluation
Model performance evaluation included both errors and
time costs evaluation. The iteration termination condition
of the model was the same in each round training (i.e., the
loss rate of the model was less than a preset threshold ɛ
−4]). We used the same test set (Test) to
[here ɛ = 1.0 × 10
evaluate the performance of models in diﬀerent training
phases. The model error evaluation used three metrics that
included overall error, commission error, and omission
error, which were deﬁned by equations (2), (3) and (4).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided text. However, it mentions that a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model was employed, but without specifying the exact framework utilized.
