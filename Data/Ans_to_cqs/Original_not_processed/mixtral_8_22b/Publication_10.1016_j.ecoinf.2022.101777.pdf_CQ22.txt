racy assessment requires these parameters to calculate the total number of 
training samples required for the image classified using Eq. 1.

The next step was accuracy assessment, which is necessary to assess 
the  reliability  of  the  results.  The  Error  of  Commission  (EC),  Error  of 
Omission  (EO), Producer  Accuracy (PA)  and User  Accuracy  (UA) were 
computed based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment. 
EO is linked to the classified results and is supplemented by PA. They refer 
to  items  that  are  left  out  of  their  correct  class  in  the  classification.  EC 
represents classified values that were predicted to be in a particular class 
but do not belong to that class. It is supplemented by UA. In this study an 
advance accuracy assessment using the SCP (Semi-Automatic Classifica-
tion Plug-in) functions for the RF classifier was performed. Using the land 
cover classification map generated, the next analytical step was to run a 
post-processing  tool  to  obtain  the  reports  from  each  classifier,  which 
provide the pixel sum and area coverage of each land cover class. Accu-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Random Forest (RF) classifier. These include Error of Commission (EC), Error of Omission (EO), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA).

Error of Commission (EC) represents the misclassified pixels that were incorrectly assigned to a specific class. This metric helps identify instances where the model made false positive predictions. On the other hand, Error of Omission (EO) refers to the omitted pixels that should have been included in a certain class but were not. EO assists in identifying false negative predictions.

Producer Accuracy (PA) measures how well the model correctly identifies ground truth data points within a specific class. High PA indicates fewer omissions or false negatives. Conversely, User Accuracy (UA) evaluates the proportion of correctly identified pixels among all those assigned to a particular class. A high UA suggests fewer commissions or false positives.

These metrics are typically calculated using an error matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, derived from the accuracy assessment process. However, the context does not explicitly mention common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Nonetheless, these can still be computed using the information available in the error matrix.
