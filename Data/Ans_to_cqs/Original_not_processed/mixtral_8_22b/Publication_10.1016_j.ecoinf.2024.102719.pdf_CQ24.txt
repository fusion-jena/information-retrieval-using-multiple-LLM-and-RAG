The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) improves the perfor-
mances of ML algorithms by finding the optimal hyperparameter set of
each ML model. The TPE estimates the probability distribution of the
hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructs a
tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function.
This probabilistic model then selects new hyperparameters for the
subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. The TPE is designed for efficient
searching in high-dimensional spaces.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, ensemble methods, cross-validation techniques, and Bayesian optimization. Setting fixed seeds ensures consistent results across different runs of the same code. Ensemble methods combine multiple models trained with different initializations or architectures to reduce variance and improve performance. Cross-validation techniques evaluate model performance on various subsets of the dataset to ensure robustness against random fluctuations. Bayesian optimization optimizes hyperparameters by considering uncertainty in the search space, which can help mitigate the impact of random initialization. However, it should be noted that these strategies do not eliminate randomness but rather manage its effects on model training and evaluation.
