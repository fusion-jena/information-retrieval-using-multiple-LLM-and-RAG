4.  A modular classification scheme. A taxonomic classification system 
requires  training data  that includes  at  least  hundreds  of  manually 
labeled individuals per class. Thus, a general purpose, yet high res-
olution, system for taxonomic classification is probably not feasible. 
Instead we envision a (gradually growing) set of custom-made AI- 
based classification models. Labeling of individual insects by experts 
is  already  implemented  in  STARdbi,  but  the  other  aspects  of  this 
vision - training, storage, retrieval and application of classification 
models  -  are  not  yet  operational.  We  are  already  creating  task- 
specific  classifiers  on  users’  requests.  The  performance  of  such  a 
classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1.

images that allows users to contribute new images as well as to query 
existing ones and their metadata. The trapped insects can be annotated, 
searched,  counted,  and  morphologically  characterized.  In  this  manu-
script  we  present  two  open-source  and  free  AI-based  tools,  for  object 
detection  and  for  assessing  percentage  cover,  which  are  already  inte-
grated  in  the  web  interface.  Integrating  the  training,  storage  and

utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for object detection and classification, we 
view  the  combination  of  such  models  with  a  user-friendly  web-based

aim  at  continuously  updating  the  AI  models  used  by  STARdbi.  An 
obvious  way  to  do  that  is  to  retrain  the  models  as  new  labeled  data

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily for object detection and assessment of percentage cover. This is evident from the mention of two open-source and free AI-based tools integrated into the web interface, one for object detection and another for assessing percentage cover. These tools are designed to aid in the analysis of images of trapped insects, allowing users to annotate, search, count, and characterize them morphologically. Additionally, there is ongoing work to integrate the training, storage, and application of taxonomic classification models, suggesting that classification could also be a future purpose of these deep learning models. However, it is important to note that while these models utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for object detection and classification, the unique contribution of this work lies in combining these models with a user-friendly web-based portal and database. Furthermore, there is a stated aim to continuously update the AI models used by STARdbi, potentially expanding their purposes over time.
