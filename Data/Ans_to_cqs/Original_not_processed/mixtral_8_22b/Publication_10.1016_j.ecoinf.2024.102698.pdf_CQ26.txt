A pertinent question which arises is “does the full set of synthetic 
input data sets successfully represent the full set of original data sets?”. 
This is a gnarly statistical problem which is usually approached in the 
context of synthetic data for machine learning problems via a prediction 
success rate (e.g. (Boyeau et al., 2024)). This this context, a model is 
trained on the synthetic data and the success of the model in predicting 
what it is designed to predict is evaluated. The same is repeated for the 
real data and prediction success rates are compared. In the case of our 
decision support tool, however, small differences in initial coral cover, 
DHW  data  and  connectivity  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
ecological model’s output trajectory, so even for a set of data which may 
be statistically similar to the original data set, the outcomes may be quite 
different. We would, however, expect a similar spread and shape in the

Classical and deep learning methods are increasingly being used to 
generate synthetic data as they can perform better at emulating complex 
patterns and relationships in the original datasets, and do not require 
knowledge  of  prior  or  posterior  distributions  for  dataset  variables. 
Classical  machine  learning  methods  include  regression,  K-nearest 
neighbours,  and  support  vector  machines,  and  can  perform  better  on 
smaller data sets and take less time to train than deep learning methods. 
Deep  learning  methods  are  based  on  neural  networks,  including

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Some common techniques used to mitigate data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset has approximately the same proportion of classes as the overall dataset. This ensures that the training and validation sets maintain the class distribution of the original dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where samples from the minority class are duplicated to balance the class distribution. This helps prevent the model from becoming biased towards the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced class distribution. However, undersampling can result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents different populations and scenarios. This helps reduce bias by ensuring that the model generalizes well across different groups.

Other techniques used to address data bias include transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset, and ensemble learning, where multiple models are combined to improve performance. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can also help increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.
