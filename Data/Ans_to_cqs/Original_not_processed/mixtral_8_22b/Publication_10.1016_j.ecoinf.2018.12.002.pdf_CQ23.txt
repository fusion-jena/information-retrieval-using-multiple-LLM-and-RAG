Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about any deep learning model or its development process. However, it mentions several studies related to various aspects of animal movement and habitat selection, including the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles.

Based on this context, we can infer some possible approaches to ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model used for similar purposes. These might include:

1. Using diverse datasets: To improve the robustness and applicability of the model across different species, environments, and behaviors, researchers could collect and utilize diverse datasets. This would help capture the variability present in real-world scenarios and reduce overfitting to a single dataset.

2. Cross-validation: By employing k-fold cross-validation, the model's ability to generalize well to new data can be evaluated. This involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets, training the model on 'k - 1' folds, and testing it on the remaining fold. Repeating this process 'k' times with different test sets provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes within the dataset, stratified sampling can be employed during train/test split. This ensures that both the training and testing sets maintain the same distribution of classes, preventing biases towards majority classes.

While these are potential strategies for enhancing the generalizability of a deep learning model based on the context provided, without explicit details regarding the development of such a model, it is impossible to confirm if these techniques were indeed implemented.
