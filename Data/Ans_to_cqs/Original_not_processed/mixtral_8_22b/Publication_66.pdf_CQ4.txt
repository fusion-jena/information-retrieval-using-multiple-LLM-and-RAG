2.4 | Alternative prediction methods

To	 compare	 predictions	 obtained	 from	 deep	 learning	 models	 with	

methods	 used	 in	 previous	 studies	 classifying	 foraging	 behaviour	 in	

seabirds	HMMs,	a	naïve	Bayes	classifier	and	speed	and	tortuosity	pre-

dictions	were	implemented	on	the	data	(see	Appendix	S8,	supporting	

information	for	details	of	the	latter).	The	Naïve	Bayes	classification,	a	

supervised	 learning	 method,	 was	 implemented	 in	 r	 using	 the	 e1071	

package	 (Meyer,	 Dimitriadou,	 Hornik,	 Weingessel,	 &	 Leisch,	 2015).	

The	inputs	were	the	same	as	used	in	the	H2O	model,	and	the	depend-

ent	 variable	 (variable	 to	 be	 predicted)	 was	 the	 binary	 dive/not	 dive	

column.

HMMs	 are	 an	 unsupervised	 learning	 method	 that	 identifies	 dis-

tude	and	latitude,	altitude	and	coverage	ratio	(proportion	of	possible	fixes	acquired	

within	a	set	window	of	time).

ent	models,	with	the	optimum	models	for	all	species	predicting	non-diving	and	diving	

behaviour	correctly	over	94%	and	80%	of	the	time,	respectively.	We	also	demonstrate	

the	superior	predictive	ability	of	these	supervised	deep	learning	models	over	other

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., applied within a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on this context. However, these techniques are commonly employed in image processing tasks to increase the size of training datasets artificially, thereby improving model performance and generalization.

Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically reversing existing ones. Rotation generates additional samples by rotating images through various angles. Scaling resizes images to different dimensions while preserving their original aspect ratio. Other popular data augmentation techniques include cropping, translation, shearing, brightness adjustment, contrast manipulation, and noise injection. These methods help expose machine learning models to more diverse input variations during training, enhancing their ability to recognize patterns and features across multiple scales, orientations, and lighting conditions.
