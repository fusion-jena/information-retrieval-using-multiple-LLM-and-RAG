Results

We  calibrated  models  for  classification  challenges  using  different  numbers  of  training 
steps, and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow (Khalighifar et al. 
2019): correct identification rate and processing time. As a result, for all challenges except 
Challenge 3, we chose 4000 training steps as an optimum number. For Challenge 3, given 
the number of species (41 species), 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. 
The details of results associated with each classification task are as follows:

Challenge 1

We  created  a  confusion  matrix  to  depict  TensorFlow’s  initial  results  with  20  species 
(Fig. 3). The overall correct identification rate was 94.3%. We achieved 100% correct iden-
tification rate for 11, and 90% or above for 17, species. The lowest identification rates were 
for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct

Across broader taxonomic scales and phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Chan and Brown 
2017), other means (biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, classification, etc.) of restrict-
ing/limiting  candidate  species  pools  may  prove  useful  for  ‘fine-tuning’  of  TensorFlow’s 
automation of species recognition. Additional caveats for future consideration include (1) 
single notes per species and (2) sample sizes, which will be limited for rare species, those 
that occur at naturally low abundances, or taxa characterized by reduced detection proba-
bilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-lim-
ited  reproductive  cycles  (Wells  2010).  Avenues  for  future  development  of  these  methods 
in  our  immediate  plans  include  application  to  additional  taxonomic  groups  (e.g.,  insects, 
birds), and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor 
step to automated species identification.

advertisement  call  notes,  and  (2)  the  potential  of  this  platform  to  accelerate  new  species 
discovery.  TensorFlow  identified  species  with  a ~ 94%  overall  correct  identification  rate. 
Incorporating distributional data increased the overall identification rate to ~ 99%. In apply-
ing TensorFlow to a dataset that included undescribed species in addition to known spe-
cies,  our  model  was  able  to  differentiate  undescribed  species  through  variation  in  “cer-
tainty” rate; the overall certainty rate for undescribed species was 65.5% versus 83.6% for 
described  species.  This  indicates  that,  in  addition  to  discriminating  recognized  frog  spe-
cies, our model has the potential to flag possible new species. As such, this work represents 
a  proof-of-concept  for  automated,  accelerated  detection  of  novel  species  using  acoustic 
mate-recognition signals, that can be applied to other groups characterized by vibrational

(2) how does TensorFlow perform when it encounters species that do not exist in its 
reference library? To answer these questions, we generated 20 spectrograms per spe-
cies for this new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to 
identification using the CNN developed in Challenge 1.

3.  Challenging TensorFlow to identify all 41 species for which recordings are available 
We increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by add-
ing 21 new, undescribed species (one species in the new dataset was already present 
in reference library, owing to a recent taxonomic change; Brown et al. 2015b). Then, 
we followed the same procedure as in Challenge 1, to test performance on a reference 
library that is twice as large as the original (i.e., 41 classes).

Helpful Answer:

The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common strategies to manage randomness include:

1. Setting a fixed seed value: By setting a fixed seed value, one can ensure that the results obtained from running the code multiple times remain consistent. This helps in reproducing the results and debugging the code.

2. Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation: K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds. Each fold is used as a validation set, while the remaining folds serve as the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every data point gets to be in the validation set exactly once. This technique reduces the variability in the results caused by the randomness in selecting the train and validation sets.

3. Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods involve combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Techniques like bagging and boosting help in reducing the variance caused by randomness in individual models.

While these strategies are commonly employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the provided context does not explicitly mention their use in the study. Therefore, further information would be required to provide a more accurate response regarding the specific strategies employed in this case.
