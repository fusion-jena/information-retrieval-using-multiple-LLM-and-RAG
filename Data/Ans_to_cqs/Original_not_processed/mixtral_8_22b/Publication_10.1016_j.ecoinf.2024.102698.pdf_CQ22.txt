Crocker et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  auto  encoders  and  generative 
adversarial  networks  (GAN),  and  are  better  at  learning  sophisticated 
patterns in data but can be more computationally expensive and require 
more data to train (Endres et al., 2022).

6.4. Connectivity data 

The  original  and  synthetic  connectivity  data  are  more  difficult  to 
compare due to being a relational data set. The quality score in Table 2 is 
listed for a comparison of an un-conditionalised sample of the connec-
tivity data (sampled at the original site positions), because the columns 
of the original and synthetic data set must match for this metric. Due to 
this the quality ratings are particularly high for the connectivity data set, 
which  would  normally  not  be  desirable  as  it  would  suggest  a  lack  of 
model generalization. The sampled synthetic connectivity data (in the 
new synthetic site positions) is also evaluated using a visual comparison 
of pairwise correlations, in Fig. 9, and a visual comparison of correlation 
matrices in Fig. 10.

5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed for learning patterns in the data. These types of models are typically evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), among others. In particular, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) mentioned in the text consists of two components - a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce realistic samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. Therefore, common evaluation metrics for GANs include Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), among others. However, since the text does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metrics, we cannot definitively state which ones were used in this case.
