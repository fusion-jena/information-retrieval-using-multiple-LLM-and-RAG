In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local

DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

2.2. Data preprocessing 

As shown in Fig. 2, the data does not exhibit a regularity and that the 
data has large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various 
parameters. Such differences would lead to problems such as substantial 
noise interference, large fluctuations, strong concealment, and difficulty 
in data handling. Consequently, the data was normalized to reduce the 
impact  of  these  large  differences.  The  normalization  formula  is 
expressed in Eq. (1).

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data is suitable for use with the chosen algorithm. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and transformation. Normalization involves adjusting the range of features so they have similar scales, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale. Scaling refers to rescaling numerical attributes to a standard range, usually between 0 and 1. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the dataset. Transformation includes converting categorical data into numerical form, encoding labels, and applying dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this case, the given text mentions that the data was normalized using the formula presented in Eq. (1) to reduce the impact of large differences among various parameters.
