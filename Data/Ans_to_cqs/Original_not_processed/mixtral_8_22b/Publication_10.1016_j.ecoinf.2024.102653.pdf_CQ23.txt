2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

2.4. Model training and hyperparameters 

The  model’s  weights  were  randomly  initialized  using  a  specific 
integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Further-
more, meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to 
achieve  optimal  model  performance.  The  selected  hyperparameters, 
which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. 

2.5. Model validation 

Two distinct validation methodologies were implemented. The first 
method  involved  partitioning  the dataset into  training and  validation 
sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for valida-
tion.  This  division  was  performed  through  random  selection  (Dobbin 
and Simon, 2011).

2. Methods 

Fig. 2 summarizes a series of processes in designing a deep-learning 
architecture that acts as a toxicovigilance tool. Subsequent sections will 
provide a comprehensive description of each section. 

2.1. Data collection

The model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset in 
order to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory 
classification  metrics.  These  subsets  corresponded  to  different  time 
steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. 
Subsequent  experiments  included  training  the  model  with  various 
combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These 
raw  and curated versions of the datasets are  readily accessible in the 
Code and Data Availability section.

Helpful Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on varying disjoint subsets of the dataset, corresponding to different time steps ranging from 5 to 25 days of flight activity recordings. This approach allowed for the assessment of the number of recordings required to achieve satisfactory classification metrics. Additionally, subsequent experiments included training the model with various combinations of datasets, including one, two, three, or all four datasets combined. This diversity in the dataset helped improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios. Furthermore, the dataset was divided into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data allocated for training and 30% for validation. This division was carried out through random selection, ensuring that the model could perform well on unseen data. Lastly, the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Overall, these measures aimed to enhance the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model by improving its capacity to generalize effectively.
