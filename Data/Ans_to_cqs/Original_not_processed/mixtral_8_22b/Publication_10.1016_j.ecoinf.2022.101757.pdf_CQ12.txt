%Query
Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper by L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. uses semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional nets, atrous convolution, and fully connected CRFs. The Deeplabv3+ architecture with COCO classes is also mentioned in the context. Therefore, the type of deep learning models used in this pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
