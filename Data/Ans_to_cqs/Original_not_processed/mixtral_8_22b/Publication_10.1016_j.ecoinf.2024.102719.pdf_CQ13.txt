The tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) improves the perfor-
mances of ML algorithms by finding the optimal hyperparameter set of
each ML model. The TPE estimates the probability distribution of the
hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructs a
tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function.
This probabilistic model then selects new hyperparameters for the
subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. The TPE is designed for efficient
searching in high-dimensional spaces.

In the present study, the TPE algorithm identified the most effective

During this process the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous
ensemble models were set to those optimized by the TPE algorithms.
Each ML model was trained on 100 different subsets generated from the
original training sets using the bootstrap method (sampling with
replacement). The number of samples in each subset equaled the num-
ber of samples in the original training data. The predictions of the
trained models on the testing dataset were averaged to obtain the main
prediction. The average loss, average bias, and average variance were
then derived for each model. The noise was assumed as 0 following
previous studies (Domingos, 2000; Kohavi and Wolpert, 1996).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm was employed to identify the most effective hyperparameters for the ensemble models. This suggests that various hyperparameters such as learning rates, optimizers, batch sizes, or even architectural parameters like the number of layers or neurons could have been considered during optimization. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding these hyperparameters, we cannot definitively state which ones were specifically utilized in the deep learning model.
