be  established  (Xie  et  al.,  2021).  Deep  noise  reduction  methods 
(Defossez et al., 2020) often use a U-net architecture which consists of an 
encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent 
space representation. The decoder then uses this latent space to recon-
struct the denoised waveform. Recently, transformer attention mecha-
nisms have also been applied with great success (Cao et al., 2022; Luo 
and  Mesgarani,  2019;  Luo  and  Mesgarani,  2023;  Zhang  et  al.,  2022; 
Zhao et al., 2022). As most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP 
applications, models are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 
22  kHz.  Bioacoustics  applications  commonly  exceed  this  bandwidth. 
Additionally, the sparsity of vocalisations in this application and many 
other  bioacoustics  applications  makes  the  development  of  large-scale 
datasets  infeasible  (Stowell,  2021).  These  factors  limit  the  success  of

training  deep  noise  reduction  techniques.  There  are  also  challenges 
when generating training data for fine-tuning. Generally, clean data is 
collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input 
data  and  a  “denoised”  ground  truth.  Collecting  clean  recordings  is 
infeasible  in  many  cases  or  requires  the  recording  of  captive  animals 
which  may  not  be  representative  of  the  wider  population.  Adjacent 
fields can generate human speech or music as required but this is not an 
option for many bioacoustics applications.

Deep learning-based denoising methods are most commonly applied 
to  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  such  as  a  human  speech 
enhancement. D´efossez et al. (Defossez et al., 2020) demonstrated the 
potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) performance and be applied in sub-real time on limited hard-
ware. These methods commonly operate on audio spectrograms but in 
recent  years  SOTA  deep  learning  methods  (Wang  et  al.,  2021)  have 
successfully  used  raw  waveform  data  (Luo and  Mesgarani,  2019; Luo 
and Mesgarani, 2023) for wider applications such as source separation 
and classification. This removes errors introduced when applying a Fast 
Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  to  generate  a  time-frequency  representation 
and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information. These 
networks tend to require more data for training as the latent space must

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning-based denoising methods, particularly focusing on their applications in natural language processing (NLP) and bioacoustic domains.

In general, data annotation techniques depend on the type of problem being addressed by the machine learning model. For example, object detection tasks might involve using bounding boxes to identify objects within images, while semantic segmentation tasks could employ pixel-level labeling to classify each image region. Similarly, text analysis problems might utilize named entity recognition (NER) or part-of-speech tagging (POS) techniques for annotating sentences.

Given the context focuses primarily on deep learning approaches for noise reduction in audio signals, relevant data annotation techniques would likely revolve around labeling audio segments based on their content or quality. For instance, one approach could involve manually identifying sections of clean versus noisy audio, allowing the creation of paired datasets for training and evaluating denoising algorithms. Alternatively, other forms of metadata, such as speaker identity or environmental conditions, might also serve as useful labels depending on the specific goals of the project.

Overall, without further details regarding the exact nature of the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context, it remains unclear what specific data annotation techniques were employed. Nevertheless, common practices in similar domains suggest potential strategies like manual segmentation and labeling of audio samples according to their characteristics or desired outputs.
