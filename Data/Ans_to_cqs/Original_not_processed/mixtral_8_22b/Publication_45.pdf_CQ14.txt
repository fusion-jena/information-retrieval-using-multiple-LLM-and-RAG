The hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity 
(number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization 
techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. The 
training of the individual candidate networks was stopped when 
the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not increase 
further.  The  thus  determined  network  architecture  was  also 
used for Experiment 2 (Abadi et al., 2016). All experiments and 
predictions  were  conducted  using  the  TensorFlow  framework 
and  run  on  a  desktop  PC  with  an  Intel  QuadCore  CPU  (Intel 
i5-6600) and equipped with an NVidia GTX 1070 GPU.

Machine learning (ML) is a family of computational algorithms 
that  is  concerned  with  identifying  structure  in  complex,  often 
nonlinear data, and generating accurate predictive models based 
on such data (Olden et al., 2008). Compared to classical statistical 
approaches  such  as  regression,  machine  learning  focuses  on 
the  use  of  computation  to  determine  and  describe  complex 
relationships, and emphasizes predictive power over estimating 
parameters and confidence intervals (Breiman, 2001; Goodfellow 
et  al.,  2016).  Situated  at  the  intersection  of  computer  sciences 
and  statistics,  and  forming  the  core  of  artificial  intelligence 
and  data  science,  ML  is  a  rapidly  growing  field  (Jordan  and 
Mitchell, 2015).

INTRODUCTION

modeling, data analysis, and statistics have drastically increased 
our  ability  to  interface  the  growing  amounts  of  data  with  our 
understanding  of  ecological  systems.  Given  that  we  are  facing 
a  future  characterized  by  no  analog  conditions  (Williams  and 
Jackson, 2007), such improvements in process understanding are 
a crucial prerequisite for successful ecological prediction (Evans, 
2012).  Finally,  increasing  computational  power  in  general  and 
a  growing  availability  of  high  performance  infrastructure  for 
scientific  computing  in  particular  provide  the  technological 
backbone supporting both previously outlined trends. All three 
of  these  recent  developments  are  important  factors  behind  the 
recent proliferation of machine learning in ecology.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through an iterative evaluation process. This means that different combinations of hyperparameters were tested repeatedly until the best combination was found. However, the specific methods used for this optimization, such as grid search or random search, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, while we can infer that some form of iterative optimization was employed, the exact method remains unspecified.
