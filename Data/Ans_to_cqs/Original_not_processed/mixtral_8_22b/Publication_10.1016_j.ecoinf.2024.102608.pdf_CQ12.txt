we selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the mini-
mum  MAE  and  RMSE,  as  well  as  the  highest  R2,  for  each  machine 
learning model. Table 1 presents the resulting hyperparameter values 
for the four machine learning models.

Owing to their ability to understand complicated patterns in data, 
ANNs have been employed in a broad variety of applications, including 
speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and 
freshwater ecology. To train properly, however, ANNs require copious 
amounts  of  data  and  can  be  computationally  intensive  (Lecun  et  al., 
2015; Rumelhart et al., 1986). 

2.5. Model performance assessment techniques 

The algorithms’ performance and parameter settings were assessed 
using a training and test set approach. Evaluation of the models involved 
analyzing key metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root- 
mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and both 
the training and test datasets.

exploring the parameter space using randomized grid search methods 
(Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). This approach helps strike a balance be-
tween model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. 
This study’s main research objectives are as follows: to demonstrate

training and test data set to evaluate the performance of the machine 
learning algorithms. Of the four machine learning algorithms, RF (S-2 
MSI: R2 = 0.61, MAE% = 6.56, RMSE = 12.51 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.56, 
MAE = 8.44%, RMSE = 16.01 μg/L) yielded the most accurate CHL-a 
predictions from the Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data in the test 
set, outperforming the KNN (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.60, MAE = 6.49%, RMSE =
12.64 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2  = 0.55, MAE = 8.24%, RMSE = 16.22 μg/L), 
AdaBoost (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.58, MAE = 7.39%, RMSE = 12.97 μg/L, L-8 
OLI: R2 = 0.44, MAE = 9.81%, RMSE = 18.11 μg/L), and ANN (S-2 MSI: 
R2 = 0.59, MAE = 7.31%, RMSE = 12.76 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.14, MAE 
= 11.27%, RMSE = 22.43 μg/L) models (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the RF 
algorithm also exhibited better SD predictions (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.45, MAE 
= 0.76%, RMSE = 1.03 m, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.35, MAE = 0.77%, RMSE =
1.09 m) and TSS (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.46, MAE = 2.95%, RMSE = 5.61 mg/L,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as part of its machine learning pipeline. However, it should be noted that while ANNs are often associated with deep learning, they do not explicitly specify which type of deep learning model is being used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively determine the specific type of deep learning model used in this case.
