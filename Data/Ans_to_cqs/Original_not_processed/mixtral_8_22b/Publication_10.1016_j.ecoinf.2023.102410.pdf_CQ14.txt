Pygmy blue whale song vocalisations were detected using an auto-
matic search algorithm as defined in Gavrilov and McCauley (2013). The 
algorithm searches for the fundamental frequency and third harmonic 
components (18 to 22 Hz and 60 to 70 Hz respectively) of the type II unit 
of the three unit EIO song type (as defined in McCauley et al., 2001; 
Mcdonald et al., 2006). The energy in the frequency bands of the type II 
song unit is compared with that in surrounding frequency bands of sea 
noise  to  detect  the  whale  sound.  The  algorithm  has  missed  and  false 
detection rates of <5% (Gavrilov and McCauley, 2013). All detections 
were  visually  verified  by  spectrograms  ensuring  that  only  validated 
detections  were  included  in  the  tracking  analysis.  Manual  perusal  of 
spectrograms allowed for classification of song structure in accordance 
with phrase and song variations outlined in Jolliffe et al. (2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they use techniques such as grid search or random search. Please provide more relevant context if available.
