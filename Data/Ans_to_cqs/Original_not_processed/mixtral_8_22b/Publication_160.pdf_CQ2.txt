Since the mid-2000s, automated image classification has seen vast
improvements, most notably in the development of deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Most researchers now consider the task of
image classification to have achieved its optimum potential (Rawat and
Wang, 2017) in light of the outstanding performances of CNNs on well-
known datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Since CNNs first
broke
recognition challenges
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012), the networks have grown deeper and more
efficient with various architectures (He et al., 2016a; Huang et al.,
2017; Szegedy et al., 2015). Complications can nonetheless arise in
applied cases such as species recognition. The variability of lighting
conditions and intra-species morphological diversity renders under-
water benthic species recognition particularly challenging (Beijbom
et al., 2012). Some studies have used machine learning algorithms for
the identification of coral reefs species (Beijbom et al., 2012; Marcos

Niculescu-Mizil, A., Caruana, R., 2005. Predicting good probabilities with supervised

images classification
(Beijbom et al., 2016; King et al., 2018; Mahmood et al., 2017, 2016),
outperformed other techniques based on hand-crafted features. In the
event that there is a lack of data, or insufficient money to fund the cost
of training state-of-the-art architectures, a CNN may first be trained
using frozen, pre-trained weights on the convolutional layers, before
the whole CNN is re-trained (King et al., 2018). This procedure ensures
that the imported weights are not significantly altered by the gradient
descents. In their study, King et al. (2018) used this method to bench-
mark different CNN architectures. They compared the accuracy on
patch-based classification (bounding box around the annotated pixel)
with VGG16, different implementations of Inception networks, and two
ResNet networks (52 and 152 layers). The CNN that achieved the best
classification accuracy in this ten-category coral classification task was
the ResNet152, which attained 90.03% accuracy.

A ResNet152 was used as the baseline for classification perfor-
mance. This network was initially programmed using pre-trained
weights lifted from the ImageNet challenge. The top fully-connected
layer was replaced with a layer using ReLU activation, followed by a
dropout layer and a softmax layer, with outputs corresponding to the
number of classes (here 61). Firstly, the top layer was trained alone;
using features extracted from the convolutional layers, a Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10−3, and weight decay
rate set to 5 × 10−4. The whole network was then trained with SGD;

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image classification tasks since the mid-2000s. It also discusses the use of CNNs for identifying coral reef species from underwater videos. Therefore, we can infer that images and possibly video data were used in these deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context refers to patch-based classification, where bounding boxes are placed around annotated pixels, further supporting the idea that image data was utilized. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot confirm if other data formats like audio, text, or CSV files were employed in the deep learning pipelines discussed here.
