2.2.3. Other data 

The land use/cover dataset for China featured a spatial resolution of 
1 km × 1 km and was acquired from RESDC. The dataset encompasses 
land use/cover information spanning the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. It covers six major land use/cover cate-
gories and twenty-six subcategories. Through a combination of manual 
and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, the primary 
land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the 
secondary  land  use/cover  categories  had  an  accuracy  exceeding  90% 
(Ning et al., 2018). In our research, the reclassified land use/cover types 
were categorized into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, 
construction land, water area, and unused land. The boundary datasets 
for  ecological  engineering  are  sourced  from  the  National  Ecological 
Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/).

Data  on  monthly  average  air  temperature  and  precipitation  from 
2000 to 2018 were sourced from the Resource and Environmental Sci-
ence Data Center (http://www.resdc.cn). Derived from daily meteoro-
logical  observations  collected  by  2472  national-level  meteorological 
stations situated throughout mainland China, this dataset employs the 
thin  plate  spline  interpolation  technique  of  ANUSPLIN  to  produce 
gridded precipitation and air temperature data with a resolution of 1 km 
× 1 km. The radiation data, with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, is an 8-day 
composite  dataset  of  net  land  surface  radiation  provided  by  Junbang 
(2021).  The  mean  air  temperature  and  overall  precipitation  for  the 
growing season of every year (March to October) were computed using 
cumulative  monthly  precipitation  and  average  air  temperature  data. 
Additionally, the mean net land surface radiation was computed for the

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the land use/cover dataset for China was acquired from RESDC and includes land use/cover information spanning several years. This dataset was created through a combination of manual and automated interpretation and on-site data validation. Additionally, the boundary datasets for ecological engineering are sourced from the National Ecological Science Data Center. Unfortunately, without more specific information regarding the deep learning pipeline or any mention of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other data annotation techniques, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query based solely on the provided context.
