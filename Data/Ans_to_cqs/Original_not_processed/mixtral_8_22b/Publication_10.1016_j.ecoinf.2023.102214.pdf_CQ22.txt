Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

3. Results 

3.1. Detection algorithm

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

3.1. Detection algorithm 

Precision-Recall performance curves were calculated on a 20% held- 
out  test  set  (413  annotations)  to  evaluate  the  trained  snow  leopard 
recognition  model’s  accuracy  and  report  its  comprehensive  detection 
success  (Fig.  4).  The  various  colors  of  the  curves  represent  different 
thresholds of non-maximum suppression (NMS) applied to the network’s 
final  bounding  box  predictions.  The  Average  Precision  (AP),  as 
measured  by  the  area  under  the  curve,  is  a  standard  approach  for 
summarizing accuracy. For example, the best-performing configuration 
with an NMS of 30% achieves an AP of 94.45%. If a detector is perfect, it 
will be represented by the colored dot at the place on the line that is 
closest to the upper right corner of the precision-recall coordinate sys-
tem. Moreover, if a fixed recall of 80% is required, the yellow diamond 
specifies the best possible accuracy across all possible configurations.

cation  studies,  a  lack  of  data  is  the  greatest  challenge  and  limitation 
researchers encounter (Schneider et al., 2019). With the data collection 
compiled  in  this  work,  we  contribute  the  largest  fully  labeled  snow 
leopard dataset for deep learning research. In addition, we anticipate 
that our novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to 
contribute  more  datasets  to  Whiskerbook.org  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep 
learning pipeline. Comparing these results to those of an earlier study by 
Johansson et al. (2020) that depended on human manual classification, 
without  AI  or  software,  determined  that  observers  significantly  over-
estimate  the  true  abundance.  AI-based  individual  ID  within  Whiske 
rbook.org  has  demonstrated  the  potential  to  enhance  the  precision 
and  efficiency  of  manual  observers,  approaching  more  accurate  esti-

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP). Precision-Recall performance curves are calculated on a held-out test set to measure the model's accuracy. The Average Precision (AP), measured by the area under the curve, is a standard method for summarizing accuracy. For instance, the best-performing configuration with a non-maximum suppression (NMS) of 30% achieved an AP of 94.45%. Additionally, the paper mentions that if a detector is perfect, it would be represented by a colored dot closest to the upper right corner of the precision-recall coordinate system. Furthermore, if a fixed recall of 80% is required, the yellow diamond specifies the best possible accuracy across all possible configurations.
