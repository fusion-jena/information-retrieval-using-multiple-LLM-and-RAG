The three sampling locations exhibit noticeable differences in bac-
terial abundance and morphology, which can be attributed to various 
experimental conditions and strong differences in image quality. These 
data were utilized as a validation set to assess the efficacy of our deep 
learning recognition model in accurately capturing and quantifying such 
differences, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. The sampling 
sites  were  thus  chosen  to  provide  large  differences  in  environmental 
conditions to demonstrate the versatility of the approach; it should be 
noted that our objective did not encompass a comparison of the effects of 
different experimental conditions on bacterial morphology.

include  flip, rotations  and  affine  transformation. We  then  trained the 
same dataset with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 
500 epochs. It is worth noting that the selection of image augmentations 
is  of  crucial  importance  to  improve  training  performance.  Multiply, 
linear  contrast,  sharpen,  emboss,  flip  in  horizontal  and  vertical  di-
rections,  rotations  and  affine  transformation  were  used  for  heavy 
augmentation.

potential of deep learning algorithms in bacterial image recognition of 
environmental samples using these datasets and provide guidelines for 
dataset preparation and training. With the increasing user-friendliness 
of  deep  learning  for  biology  groups  without  much  AI  experience,  we 
found that image annotation equivalent to a few weeksâ€™ work can pro-
vide satisfactory information on bacterial populations within the chips. 
This method is expected to be useful for environmental microbiological 
research  and  analysis  using  imaging  methods,  particularly  on  micro-
fluidic  platforms,  where  the  combination  of  controlled  experimental 
manipulations  and  monitoring  of  processes  with  high  environmental 
realism,  including  chemo-physical  conditions  and  biotic  interactions, 
presents significant potential.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study primarily focuses on utilizing images for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they mention using multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformations for heavy augmentation. This suggests that the input data format for this particular deep learning pipeline is likely image data. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the available context, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
