Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Training protocols

approach in computer vision, consistently demonstrating superior per-
formance  across  various  tasks  and  benchmarks.  The  use  of  machine 
learning in ecology is not new (Crisci et al., 2012), it already has been 
used for tasks such as ecological modeling (Recknagel, 2001), the study 
of animal behavior (Arablouei et al., 2023), and species identification 
(Waldchen and Mader, 2018). What makes deep learning such a growing 
field is the recent availability of powerful hardware and large amounts 
of  training  data.  By  learning  from  the  given  example  deep  learning 
models can extract important features and resolve a task without being 
specifically programmed to resolve it (LeCun et al., 2015), which makes

relevant regions within the images. ROI pooling aids in the selection and 
analysis  of  specific  image  regions  for  accurate  object  classification.  2 
different  versions  of  Faster  R-CNN  were  created  for  the  benchmark, 
Faster R-CNN (640) with an input dimension of 640 × 640 and Faster R- 
CNN (1280) with an input dimension of 1280 × 1280. They both used 
Resnet50 as a backbone, have 41 m parameters, and are pre-trained on 
ImageNet.  Both  those  dimensions  were  chosen  to  match  the  Yolov5 
input dimensions. Still, after multiple tests, the 640-version had incon-
clusive results. This can be explained by the important features being too 
small using this resolution for Faster R-CNN. Only the 1280 version was 
used in the benchmark.

2.3. Evaluation 

The  evaluation  of  our  models  was  a  crucial  step  in  analyzing  the 
ability of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to detect and identify 
Collembola on microscope slides. To do so we proceed as follows, first, 
we made predictions on an evaluation dataset that we've extracted from 
the main dataset. This ensures that the model has never encountered this 
particular dataset during its training phase. The predictions-annotations 
matching is done by calculating the IoU metric Eq. 1 for each possible 
pair  and  matching  them  based  on  it.  The  IoU  Eq.  1  is  a  metric  that 
quantifies the overlap between the annotation and the prediction box. 
We  considered  that  an  IoU  of  0.5  between  the  prediction  and  the 
annotation  is  a  match.  If  a  prediction  didn't  match  any  annotation 
human annotation, it was considered to be a background element.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that the growth of deep learning is due to the recent availability of powerful hardware. In general, deep learning models often require significant computational resources, and GPU or TPU accelerators are commonly used for training these models due to their ability to perform parallel operations efficiently. Therefore, while I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning model mentioned might have been trained using either GPUs or TPUs.
