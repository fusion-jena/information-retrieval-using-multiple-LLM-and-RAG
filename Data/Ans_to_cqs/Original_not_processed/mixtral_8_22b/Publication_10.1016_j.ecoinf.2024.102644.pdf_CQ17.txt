4.3. Advantages and drawbacks 

4.3.1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges

To  manage  this  issue,  we  followed  the  practice  advised  by  other 
studies  (Coro  et  al., 2022c;  Elith  et  al., 2011a)  to disable  clamping in 
MaxEnt. This option allows the model to extend the estimated proba-
bility distribution beyond the parameter ranges observed on the training 
set. Since MaxEnt learns a complex, multidimensional function between 
the observations and the environmental parameters, it is hard to eval-
uate the overall goodness of its extension precisely. However, the single- 
parameter response curves (i.e., the marginal distributions) can be used

Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some information regarding this topic. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce overdependence on any single feature and prevents overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting due to large weight values. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. In summary, while the provided context does not discuss these methods specifically, they are important tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
