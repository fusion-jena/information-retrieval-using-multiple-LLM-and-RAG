Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

models were trained and tested on training and testing datasets. Later, 
performances of the model were conducted for both phases.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the models.
