3.2. Model performance 

The five  component  models (GLM,  MaxEnt,  RF, GBM,  and  MARS) 
demonstrated variable  performance (Table 2).  Notably, the  RF model 
and the GLM model demonstrated the best and worst performance for all 
studied species, respectively (Table 2). 

3.3. Variable contributions to habitat suitability 

In the ensemble habitat suitability model, distance to mining roads, 
distance  to  roads,  distance  to  CAs,  and  distance  to  water  resources 
played  important  roles  in  predicting  habitat  suitability  for  the  three 
species (Table  3). Response curves  detailing the  relationship between 
habitat suitability and environmental variables in the best-performing 
model  (the  RF  model),  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Materials

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of various statistical computing environments such as R and different machine learning algorithms like GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS. However, it does not provide any details regarding the use of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model based on the available context.
