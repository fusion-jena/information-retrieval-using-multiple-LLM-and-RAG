hyperparameters.  The  hyperparameters  with  the  current  results  are 
saved until better accuracy is achieved. The termination criterion of the 
proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. 
After the completion of the iterations, the proposed approach provides 
us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN. 
The  overall  complexity  is  dominated  by  the  iterations,  “TC”,  and 
within  each  iteration,  the  operations  depend  on  the  population  size 
“NP”.  Therefore,  the  total  complexity  can  be  approximated  as 
O(TC*NP).

%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors used two datasets for their study - Mendeley and CVIP100. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, using multiple diverse datasets could help improve the robustness and generalization ability of a model. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been employed during training to further enhance the model's performance across different subsets of data. However, without more detailed information about the methodology used, it is not possible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
