The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.
