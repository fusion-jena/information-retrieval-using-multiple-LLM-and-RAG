2.3.2. LST retrieval 

LST is a valuable source of data that provides insights into the cli-
matic, environmental, and physical characteristics of the Earth’s surface 
(Çolak and Sunar, 2020; Jimenez-Munoz et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2021). 
It can be estimated from satellite data or direct ground-truth measure-
ments. In this study, we derived the LST dataset from infrared radiations 
measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The 
data  was  obtained  from  the  MOD11A2  product,  which  offers  8-day 
temporal  and  1  km  spatial  resolutions  covering  2005–2018.  It  is 
important to note that LST can only be accurately measured under clear- 
sky conditions. To calculate LST from MODIS Terra MOD11A2, we uti-
lised an equation provided below by Artis and Carnahan in 1982 (Artis 
and Carnahan, 1982).

2.3.3. Modelling 

Artificial  neural  networks  are  a  successful  method  in  modelling 
studies and are frequently discussed in the literature. Essentially, neural 
networks learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships 
among  the  data,  and  utilise  them  to  make  predictions  for  future  sce-
narios. Among the various types of artificial neural network models, the 
NARX model is widely employed. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN 
model  was  utilised  to  define  vegetation  biomass  density  for  2030.  A 
hybrid  model  was  developed  by  combining  wavelet  analysis  and  the 
NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN 
model.

On  the  other  hand,  the  significant  processing  time  required  to 
generate  precise  LULC  maps  via  satellite  image  processing  remains  a 
primary  challenge  for  remote  sensing  researchers.  This  challenge  is 
particularly pronounced when dealing with medium-resolution satellite 
images like Landsat data. Extensive research has shown that artificial 
neural network models effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency 
of LULC mapping using remote sensing data. Extensive studies have used 
artificial neural network models to map land use and land cover with 
remote sensing data to improve accuracy and efficiency (Alshari et al., 
2023; Do et al., 2022; Karpatne et al., 2016; Waleed et al., 2023; Yuh

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the LST dataset was derived from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The data was obtained from the MOD11A2 product, offering 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. Additionally, the study utilized the NARX feedback ANN model to define vegetation biomass density for 2030, developing a hybrid model by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance its performance.
