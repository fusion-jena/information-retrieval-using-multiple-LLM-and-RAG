Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

A.1.2. Loading the pre-trained module 

By default, LaDeco employs the deeplabv3 þ resnet269 model. The deeplabv3 part is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google 
(Chen et al., 2018), and Resnet269 is a 269-layer Resnet neural network (Zhang et al., 2020). Users can switch to other pre-trained models as needed 
(Please refer to https://cv.gluon.ai/api/model_zoo.html#). 

A.1.3. Setting the threshold 

The primary function of LaDeco is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. Users can set a threshold to filter out 

negligible values; for example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This threshold is customizable.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, none of the given pieces of context directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it is important to note that handling randomness is crucial in ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of results obtained from deep learning models. Some commonly employed strategies include setting fixed seeds for various libraries or functions, which ensures consistent initialization of weights and biases across multiple runs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods help mitigate the effects of randomness during training and evaluation phases.
