The process of identifying an ESA is a multicondition optimization 
problem. We first divided the source into multiple candidate lists, each 
with specific location coordinates and areas, to determine the optimal 
source.  Next,  three  key  factors  were  considered:  the  source  area,  dis-
tance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA. 
Basic quantification conditions were set for these three key factors, and 
the  specific  quantification  standards  are  listed  in  Table  5.  Genetic 
optimization  algorithms  were  used  to  adjust  the  hyperparameters  to 
determine the algorithm parameters for this study referring to the use of 
artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide sus-
ceptibility prediction (Daviran et al., 2023). Finally, the fitness function 
was determined based on the specific conditions of this study. The entire 
optimization process was implemented by programming in Python, and 
the main steps were as follows:

P  = 50, the  ESA was  the  best, the  connectivity  rate of  the  ecological 
source  was  84.99%,  the  IIC  value  was  0.81,  the  ecological  source 
coverage  rate was  the highest, and  the fragmentation index  was low. 
Therefore, the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have employed some form of validation technique such as cross-validation or stratified splitting due to their common usage in machine learning models. Additionally, they mentioned using genetic optimization algorithms to adjust hyperparameters which could also contribute towards improving the model's performance across different datasets. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact methods applied, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
