Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization is a technique used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during model training. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. This results in a more robust network that can generalize better to unseen data. The rate of dropout is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty equivalent to the sum of squares of all the weights in the network to the loss function. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of this penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization techniques include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the weights to the loss function, promoting sparse solutions. Early Stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, preventing further overfitting. Data Augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to existing ones, effectively increasing the size of the dataset and reducing overfitting.
