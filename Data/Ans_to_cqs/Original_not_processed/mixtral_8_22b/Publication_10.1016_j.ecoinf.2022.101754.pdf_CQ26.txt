Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

Preprocessed  ALS  data  (see  Section  2.3)  were  combined  with  the 

field data and further processed as follows:  

1.  Cylindrical plot design. Based upon coordinates of the center of each 
field plot, a circular buffer of 500 m2 is taken and a subsection of the 
point cloud is cut out.  

2.  Lidar data thinning. Cloud density is unified based on the number of 
the first returns per plot. We worked with four point density levels: 
2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 points per m2 (Fig. 4). That was achieved by a 
random selection of 1250, 2500, 3750, and 5000 points from each 
cloud subsection. More precisely, these point counts were weighted 
by  a  ratio  of  first  return  versus  all  returns  to  simulate  a  uniform 
density of emitted laser pulses. 

3. Descriptive  statistics  calculation.  Using  data  from  each  cloud  sub-
section  with  a  unified  density,  the  following  descriptive  statistics 
(hereinafter referred to as predictors) were calculated:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the study uses 100 different splits to the training-and-test set for each setting. Additionally, tuning of the hyperparameters on the training set is performed for each set before model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameters. However, there is no explicit mention of other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed in this particular study.
