All  data  analysis  was  conducted  in  R  4.0.5  (R  Development  Core 
Team, 2021). Gaping data, expressed in proportion of aperture where 
0 is fully closed and 1 is fully opened, and recorded at 1 Hz (see Bertolini 
et al., 2021c), were averaged (mean) over 5 min in the Venice Lagoon 
and over 1 min in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was 
due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1 min averages 
would  make  the  Venice  files  too  large  to  easily  process,  while  in  the 
Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technical feasible. Daily curves of 
gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis yielding 
1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the 
Wadden Sea.

also other bivalve species and other locations. This may go so far as even 
including  bivalves  in  offshore  environments.  Overall,  this  would 
improve bioenergetic models, where clearance and respiration terms are 
inherently  linked  with  gaping.  The  current  formulations  of  models 
however do not account for linkages with food, aside from considering a 
half saturation constant, nor the different degrees of daily oscillations. 
Further  experimentation,  under  constrained  lab  conditions,  linking 
gaping activity with actual clearance rate and respiration rates under 
different  settings  will  also  help  devising  indices  that  could  be  then 
extrapolated to use gaping directly in the models. An indication of en-
ergy consumption during valve movement would also be useful to infer 
the  consequences of  having  a more or less  pronounced  amplitudes of 
gaping, to better formulate this term in energetic based growth models.

Various models that relate clearance to environmental variables have 
been  proposed  and  reviewed  (Ehrich  and  Harris,  2015).  Given  the 
increasing emphasis on understanding the ecosystem services provided 
by  bivalves  and  their  potential  role  in  restoration  aquaculture  (e.g. 
nutrient  removal,  carbon  storage.),  it  is  important  for  clearance  and 
respiration to be modelled correctly (Ehrich and Harris, 2015). Ideally, 
gaping  behaviour  should  thus  be  introduced  in  bioenergetic  process- 
based individual models to correctly simulate clearance rate and respi-
ration. As filtration is costly in terms of energy expenditure (Riisgård 
and  Larsen,  2000),  mussels  might  close  their  valves  during  environ-
mental stressful periods or when food concentrations or food quality is 
low (Dolmer, 2000). This may lead to large differences in feeding rates 
as predicted from laboratory experiments and as occurs in situ.
