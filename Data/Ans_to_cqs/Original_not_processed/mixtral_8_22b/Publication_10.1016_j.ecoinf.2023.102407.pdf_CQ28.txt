2021), have proven their potential in predicting distributions of various 
species. However, these models require large amounts of observational 
data for the target species to learn appropriate environmental charac-
teristics. When such data are not sufficient, ML-based SDMs suffer from 
poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure 
(Gaul  et  al.,  2020;  Wisz  et  al.,  2008).  This  data  shortage  problem  is 
especially  common  for  rare  or  endangered  species,  and  for  invasive 
species in their early stages of introduction (Lomba et al., 2010; Zhang 
et al., 2020). Several strategies have been suggested to solve this prob-
lem.  Typical  examples  include  spatial  extrapolation  using  models 
trained  with  sufficient  observational  data  for  external  areas  (Farashi 
et al., 2013) and the integration of multiple observational datasets (e.g., 
citizen science dataset) collected by different sampling designs (Tehrani

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions several research papers related to machine learning, ecology, and species distribution modeling but does not mention any details regarding the deployment of the deep learning model on a particular cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
