including multiple linear regression, machine learning (bootstrap forest, 
boosted tree), and deep learning (ANN) models through statistical and 
machine learning methods and compare them for prediction accuracy. 
The ultimate aim was to develop a holistic model with better accuracy 
and reliability for the prediction of CLCuD which ultimately can help 
timely application of management decisions in the prevailing climatic 
conditions.

models (Table 4). Further, to reduce the dependency on data other than 
temperatures  and  improve  prediction  ability  we  analyzed  ML  tools- 
ANN, -BSF and BST models using growing degree days (GDD) data. The 
model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well 
as different testing and training data sets.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, consisting of multiyear multilocation data. This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of scenarios and conditions, improving its ability to generalize to new situations. Secondly, the model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well as different testing and training data sets. This helped to ensure that the model could perform well across a variety of settings and configurations. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques such as bootstrap forest and boosted tree models likely contributed to the robustness and adaptability of the final model. However, it is not explicitly stated whether specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the development process. Nonetheless, these standard practices are often used to further enhance the generalizability of predictive models.
