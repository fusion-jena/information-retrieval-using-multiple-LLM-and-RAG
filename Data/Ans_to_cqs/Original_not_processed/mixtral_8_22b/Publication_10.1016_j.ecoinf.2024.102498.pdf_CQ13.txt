Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

5.4.3. Performance evaluation 

For  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  generated  LULC  map  in 
simulating meteorological parameters, statistical metrics such as Root 

Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Bias were 
defined below:

denotes the number of the ground stations. 

6. Results 

6.1. Result of pixel-based and object-based classifications 

Depending  on  the  strategy  used  for  LULC  classification,  including 
pixel-based  and  object-based  approaches,  various  ML  models  were 
implemented and evaluated during warm and cool seasons. The results

the inability to split further, is met. This algorithm is simple, fast, and 
highly interpretable (Gislason et al., 2006). It is important to note that 
CART models can be susceptible to overfitting without proper tuning of 
input  parameters.  In  this  research,  by  evaluating  the  model's  perfor-
mance  using  validation  data,  it  was  determined  that  setting  the  Max 
Nodes parameter to its default value (no limit on the number of nodes)

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizers like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and regularization methods like dropout or weight decay. Without more details, I cannot provide a precise list of hyperparameters used in the deep learning model discussed in the text.
