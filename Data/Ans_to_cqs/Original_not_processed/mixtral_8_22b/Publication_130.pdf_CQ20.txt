%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, based solely on the information given, it cannot be determined what hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model.
