Similarly, in [8] hyper-spectral bottom index imagery is used for bottom-type classiﬁca-
tion in coral reef areas. The drawback of this technique is the need for an enormous number
of samples in the dataset for achieving higher accuracy. In [9], they proposed a method
of deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 for corresponding coral classiﬁcation that
needs a massive dataset for better accuracy.

1. Randomly select ’o’ cluster centers.
2. Calculate the distance between feature and cluster centers.
3. Assign the feature to the cluster center whose distance from the cluster center is
minimum of all the cluster centers.

where, (cid:48)o(cid:48)
5. Recalculate the distance between each feature and new obtained cluster centers.
6. If no feature was reassigned then stop, otherwise repeat from step 3.

For each sample
1. Compute the average distance from all features in the same cluster (αi)
2. Compute the average distance from all features in the closest cluster (βi)
3. Compute the co-efﬁcient: Sc = βi−αi
If Sc = 0 The sample is very close to the neighboring clusters.
If Sc = 1 The sample is far away from the neighboring clusters.
If Sc = −1 The sample is assigned to the wrong clusters.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general techniques can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These methods include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by randomness, and employing cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to evaluate model performance more robustly. Additionally, advanced optimization algorithms like Bayesian Optimization can help tune hyperparameters while accounting for randomness. Nonetheless, it should be noted that these strategies may not be explicitly mentioned or utilized within the given context.
