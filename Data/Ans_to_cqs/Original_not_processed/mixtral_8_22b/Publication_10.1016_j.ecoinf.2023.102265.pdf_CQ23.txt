easy to train with reduced complexity, even though they have deeper 
layers than CNN models, because of the presence of skip connections 
between the input and output of each block (He et al., 2016). ResNet has 
different variants with a variety of convolution layers. We trialled three 
depths, ResNet-18, (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 101, and compared their training times 
and validation accuracies. They behaved similarly but ResNet-50 had a 
marginally  higher  validation  accuracy  (Section  3.1.1)  leading  us  to 
choose it for feature extraction.

ran in approximately 1.2 min for our experiments on the CPU, whilst 
softmax  took  12  min  on  the  GPU  to  complete  the  same  task.  So, 
although, softmax can accomplish our classification task, our proposed 
method has advantages.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors used a diverse dataset consisting of honey bee images with both 'natural' and 'anthropogenic' backgrounds to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Additionally, they employed a pre-trained ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction, which was chosen based on its marginally higher validation accuracy compared to other depths such as ResNet-18 and ResNet-101. The use of a pre-trained model allowed them to leverage the knowledge gained from large datasets during the initial training phase, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
