In multidisciplinary collaboration, it is crucial to connect soil infor-
mation  with  other  data,  such  as  climate  data,  to  provide  a  more 
comprehensive understanding of various biological and ecological pro-
cesses.  BeingAliveLanguage  has  the  ability  to  integrate  climate  data 
extracted  from  water  balance  graphs  or  Bagnouls-Gaussen  diagram,1 
which  describes  the  relationship  between  temperature  and  precipita-
tion, to illustrate the limiting factors (mainly duration and intensity of 
drought) for plant growth and reproduction (Filippi, 2007).

As shown in Fig. 4, we also integrate two supplementary parameters, 
namely the “current (soil) water content” and the “organic matter”, due 
to their significant relavance to climate and ecological processes. The 
former parameter is employed to depict the the soil water content of soil 
at a specific location and time, while the latter is utilized to indicate the 
quantity of organic materials in the soil. The density of these lines varies 
across different units, enabling the visualization of the distribution of 
organic matter within a soil horizon.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not contain information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning models for classification purposes in digital soil mapping. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hyperparameters were used in those studies. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent), regularization techniques (such as dropout, weight decay), and activation functions (such as ReLU, sigmoid). These hyperparameters can greatly affect the performance of the model and need to be carefully tuned during training.
