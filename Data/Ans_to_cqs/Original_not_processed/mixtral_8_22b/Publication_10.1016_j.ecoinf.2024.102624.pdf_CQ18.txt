We  classified  all  the  input  dataset combinations  (10  variable  sets; 
Table  2)  with  each  classifier  (RF,  SVM,  MARS)  and  with  two  sets  of 
classes (7C and 13C); thus, we had 60 models as a result of the classi-
fications. Classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in 
R  4.2  (R  Core  Team,  2023)  with  the  caret  package  (Kuhnaut  et  al., 
2022). 

2.4. Accuracy assessment

The  reference  dataset  was  split  into  training  and  testing  sets  at  a 
70:30 ratio, and we applied two types of accuracy assessments. (i) In the 
model  building  phase,  using  the  training  dataset,  we  applied  10-fold 
cross-validation  with  three  repetitions.  The  training  dataset  was 
randomly split into 10 folds; 9 folds were used for model training and 1 
for testing, and this procedure ended when all folds were testing data. 
The whole sequence was repeated using two new random splits (Abriha 
et al., 2023; Molinaro et al., 2005). This type of accuracy assessment, 
with  hyperparameter  tuning,  helps  to  find  the  best  models  with  the 
largest  overall  accuracy  (OA),  and  also  reflects  the  resulting  30  OAs 
distribution  models  with  minimums,  maximums,  quartiles,  and  me-
dians. The smaller the range of possible model outcomes (OAs), the more 
reliable the prediction. (ii) Based on the testing dataset, we predicted the

Staiano, 2019). Training data augmentation, which extends the existing 
training  data,  enhances  the  generalization  capabilities  (Lik´o  et  al., 
2023). Post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering gener-
ally  provide  better  maps  with  a  lower  rate  of  salt-and-pepper  errors 
(Ahmed et al., 2017). We can also deal with the characteristics of the 
geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining the training 
samples, or changing the proportion of the training and test data. These 
strategies collectively improve classification accuracy, enabling better 
modelling of the environment.

Helpful Answer:

In order to monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a 10-fold cross-validation technique with three repetitions. They randomly divided the reference dataset into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing purposes. During the model building phase, they utilized the training dataset and applied the 10-fold cross-validation method. In this process, the training dataset was further partitioned into ten equal subsets or 'folds'. For each iteration, nine folds were used for model training while one fold served as the testing set. This cycle continued until every fold had been designated as the testing data once. To ensure robustness, the entire sequence was reiterated twice using different random splits.

This approach to accuracy assessment, coupled with hyperparameter tuning, facilitated the identification of the most accurate models based on their overall accuracy (OA). Moreover, it offered insights into the distribution of potential model outcomes by providing information about minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. A narrower range of possible model outcomes indicated higher reliability in predictions.

Therefore, the strategy adopted to track the model performance during training involved implementing a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation technique with multiple iterations and random splits. This methodology not only helped pinpoint the optimal models but also gauged the stability and dependability of these models through an analysis of their outcome distributions.
