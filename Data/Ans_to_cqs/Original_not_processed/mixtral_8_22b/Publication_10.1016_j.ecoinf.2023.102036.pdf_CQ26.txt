straightforward methodology, and it is developed within a much more

are becoming familiar with deep learning approaches.

the growing computing capability of machines and availability of big 
data, making it possible to extract high levels of representation of image 
content  (Hassaballah  and  Hosny,  2019).  This  field  falls  into  artificial 
intelligence  and,  in  particular,  deep  learning,  which  has  recently 
received  large  attention  from  ecologists  (Christin  et  al.,  2019).  Deep 
learning  is  a  sub-field  of  artificial  intelligence  which  focuses  on  a 
learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the 
architectural  characteristics  of  the  brain  (the  so-called  deep  artificial 
neural networks). It consists of processing units within the global system 
that  specialize  in  detecting certain  hidden  characteristics  in the  data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does indicate that the authors use existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome limitations in dataset size. While this may suggest some form of addressing data imbalance, it does not directly refer to any of the mentioned techniques. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this case.
