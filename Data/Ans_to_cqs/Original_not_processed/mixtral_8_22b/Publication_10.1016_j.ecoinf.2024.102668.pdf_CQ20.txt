bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Our proof-of-principle example demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
comprehensive  processing  pipeline  in  mitigating  device  biases  in  site 
comparisons  using  ecoacoustic  indices  (EAI).  Although  EAIs  are  not 
typically  used  for  site  comparisons  due  to  contradictory  correlations 
with biological variables across different study sites (Bradfer-Lawrence 
et  al.,  2019a),  our  methodology  addresses  one  of  the  previously  un-
considered sources of variability that could explain these contradictions, 
such  as  differences  between  recording  devices.  By  eliminating  device 
bias, we expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine 
learning  and  deep  learning,  which  require  consistent  feature  spaces 
regardless of the recording device used.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized based on this context alone.
