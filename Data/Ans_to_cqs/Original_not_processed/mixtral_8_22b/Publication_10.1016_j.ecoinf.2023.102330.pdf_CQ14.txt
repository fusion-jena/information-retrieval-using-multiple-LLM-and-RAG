Our final component of this model is a cue rate sub-model, where we 
assume  again  a  weakly  informative  prior  on  call  rate  based  on  mean 
estimates of covey calling rates from Wellendorf et al., (2004) [CallRate 
~ Normal (42.97, 1)] and the average number of birds per covey. ARU 
estimated area of coverage was calculated using dmax and the number of 
ARUs,  and  bobwhite  density  was  obtained  as  birds  per  hectare.  We 
supplied vague priors for all other parameters: ∈j
2  ~ Exponential (1/5), 

dj ~ Uniform (0, dmax) and ψ  ~ Normal (0.5, 10). Bias associated with 
the point count and ARU DS methods was calculated for the simulated 
data using root mean squared error (RMSE), and precision using coef-
ficient of variation (CV).

The northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is a gallinaceous upland 
gamebird that has been experiencing population declines throughout its 
native range over the past six decades (Brennan, 1991). Despite wide-
spread declines in population size, many populations are still harvested 
annually.  One  of  the  primary  methods  for  managing  bobwhite  pop-
ulations  is  through  setting  and  modifying  harvest  quotas  based  on 
changes in population density (Hern´andez et al., 2013). The effective-
ness  of  harvest  quotas  for  maintaining  viable  populations  while  also 
maximizing  recreational  opportunities  depends  on  the  accuracy  of 
density estimates. We designed a simulation study to evaluate bias (i.e. 
accuracy) and precision when calculating density estimates using four of 
the  most  common  methods  currently  used  in  the  field  for  bobwhite 
monitoring: 1) DS from point counts, 2) DS using ARUs, 3) SCR using

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they were optimized using techniques such as grid search or random search.
