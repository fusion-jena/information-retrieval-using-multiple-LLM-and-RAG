Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow (https://tensorflow.org (accessed on 24 June 2021)), which is an end-to-end open source platform for DL, was used to develop our species richness estimation model. In developing DL models, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned prior to training the model, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (ùêáùëó,ùëó=1,2,‚ãØ,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 2490

Due to the unique characteristics of neural networks, which solve problems by ex-
ploiting the hidden relationships inherent in multiple input variables, it was difÔ¨Åcult to
physically quantify the importance of the input variables. As an alternative, we performed
a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest sig-
niÔ¨Åcance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in
an operational retrieval system. For the SFIT, a single feature was randomly shufÔ¨Çed,
while all the other features were kept constant. We iterated this process by changing the
test variable. The feature importance shows the extent to which the model performance
decreased with random shufÔ¨Çing. In this study, we used the root mean square error (RMSE)
as the performance metric.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through iterative grid search parameter tuning. This method involves selecting a range of values for each hyperparameter and then exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of these values to find the best set of hyperparameters for the given problem. In this study, after performing the grid search, the authors found that using five hidden layers with varying numbers of neurons in each layer produced the best results for their specific application.
