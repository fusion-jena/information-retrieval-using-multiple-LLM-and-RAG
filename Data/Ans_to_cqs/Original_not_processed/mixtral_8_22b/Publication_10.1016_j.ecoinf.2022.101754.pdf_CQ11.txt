%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository containing the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given references. However, it can be suggested to check each reference individually or contact their respective authors for more specific details regarding the availability of such resources.

Alternatively, one could search popular scientific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF using relevant keywords related to the topic, such as 'deep learning', 'forest biomass', 'lidar', and 'landsat'. This might help locate any publicly accessible datasets or pipelines associated with these studies.
