In this work, we resorted to purely deterministic variants of these 

architectures.  The  models  were  implemented  using  the  deep  learning 
framework PyTorch Lightning (Falcon, 2019) which is built on top of 
PyTorch  (Paszke  et  al.,  2019)  and  enables  improved  scalability.  The 
hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) 
hyperparameter optimization procedure.

Deep  learning  methods  have  had  great  success  for  highly  related 
domains  such  as  agriculture  (Kamilaris  and  Prenafeta-Boldú,  2018). 
Also, work on LSTMs and other predictive models for vegetation health 
and  land  surface  dynamics  forecasting  for  datasets  other  than  Earth-
Net2021  exist  (Koehler  and  Kuenzer,  2020;  Lees  et  al.,  2022).  Ap-
proaches to the EarthNet2021 challenge specifically use existing video 
prediction  solutions  (Requena-Mesa  et  al.,  2021).  The  Channel-U-Net 
model  uses  an  architecture  roughly  based  on  U-Net  (Ronneberger 
et al., 2015), where all input data is stacked along the channel dimension 
and does not model the temporal dependencies explicitly. The second 
model,  Arcon,  is  an  adaptation  of  the  Stochastic  Adversarial  Video 
Prediction  model  (Lee  et  al.,  2018)  which  does  model  temporal  de-
pendencies, but it was designed primarily for a highly stochastic setting

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given information does not provide details about the specific code repository or version control system used for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the code repository is available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out more about the availability of the code repository, one would need additional information from the authors or their research group.
