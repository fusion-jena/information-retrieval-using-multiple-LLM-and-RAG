EfficientNet-B5  feature  extractor  [27].  EfficientNet  is  a 
CNN  developed  by  Google,  characterized  by  high  accu-
racy  and  computational  efficiency.  Model-2  was  initial-
ized  by  pre-trained  weights  based  on  the  Imagenet  data 
set  [28].  All  the  parameters  were  optimized  using  the 
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

Training

An  Nvidia  GeForce  RTX  2060  GPU  was  used  for  train-
ing,  with  a  batch  size  of  8.  Model-1  (without  feature 
extractor)  was  trained  for  7  h  and  Model-2  (with  a  fea-
ture  extractor)  for  17  h.  Based  on  the  model’s  perfor-
mance on the validation set, the early stopping technique 
was  applied  to  avoid  over-fitting.  Model-2,  which  used 

pre-trained  weights  and  thus  some  prior  relevant  infor-
mation, converged faster than Model-1 (Fig. 3).

feed-forward  regression  networks  in  [11,  26]  compress 
and  encode  images  into  smaller  representation  vectors,

[11]  takes  an  input  image  of  size 72 × 72  and  produces 
an  output  density  map  of  size  18 × 18 .  To  overcome 
this  potential  information  loss,  the  UNet  model  was 
employed  as  the  learning  model  [24].  UNet  is  a  CNN 
architecture  originally  proposed  for  biomedical  image 
segmentation,  based  on  an  encoder–decoder-type  net-
work.  The  name  of  the  architecture  is  derived  from  its 
distinctive ‘U’ shape. The down-sampling/encoder block 
encodes the input images into feature representations at 
multiple  level,  capturing  the  context  information  from 
the  image. The  up-sampling/decoder  block  decodes  the 
feature  maps  learned  from  the  encoder.  The  symmet-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide any explicit information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU was used for training the model. However, it doesn't specify whether this GPU was part of a cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, or if it was a local machine setup. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
