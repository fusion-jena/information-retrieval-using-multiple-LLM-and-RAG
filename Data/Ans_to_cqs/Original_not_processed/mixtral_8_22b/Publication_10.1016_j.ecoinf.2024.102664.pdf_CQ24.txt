Algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022 were evalu-
ated using various deep learning models, as summarized in Table 3. The 
hybrid  CNN-LSTM  model  demonstrated 
superior  performance 
throughout  the  year,  achieving  the  highest  values  for  POD  and  HSS 
compared to other models. Notably, the LSTM model outperformed the 
CNN model. The Zhoushan fishery exhibits pronounced seasonal varia-
tion in algal blooms, with the highest occurrence in summer, totaling 
8468 bloom days, followed by Spring with 4720 bloom days. Among all 
seasonal forecasts, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved 
the  highest  HSS  values.  Specifically,  during  the  peak  algal  bloom 
occurrence in summer, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model excelled with both 
POD and HSS at 0.32. In contrast, during winter and autumn, the hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model displayed lower HSS values, primarily due to elevated 
FAR.  Across  all  model  forecasts  and  seasonal  variations,  the  POCR

In  Chl  dynamic  forecasting,  Long Short-term  Memory  (LSTM) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are commonly used deep learning 
models (Baek et al., 2021; Lee and Lee, 2018; Yussof et al., 2021). Re-
searchers have successfully applied CNN and LSTM models to analyze 
Chl  concentration  distribution  in  different  regions  (Jin  et  al.,  2021; 
Yussof et al., 2021). Combining diverse deep learning networks to create 
hybrid models, such as the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, has proven effec-
tive in addressing complex nonlinear challenges (Anderson et al., 2016; 
Wang et al., 2020). This integration offers enhanced forecasting efficacy 
compared to individual network (Barzegar et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2017). 
Advancements  in  ocean  satellite  monitoring  technology  have 
significantly  improved  the  precision  of  satellite  data  (Amani  et  al., 
2022a,  2022b),  making  it  a  crucial  information  source  for  machine

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide specific details on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, common strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance. These approaches help ensure consistent results across multiple runs and improve overall robustness.
