Google Earth Engine  (GEE; Gorelick  et al.,  2017) is  a  cloud-based 
platform 
to  high-performance 
computing with high applicability in wildfire science (e.g. Parks et al., 
2018; Piao et al., 2022; Roteta et al., 2021) because it hosts a vast remote 
sensing  data  catalog  in  the  petabyte  scale,  including  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)  and  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration 
(NASA) datasets over 40-years. These datasets can be readily processed 
at very large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing (Gorelick 
et al., 2017), taking advantage of advanced image processing techniques 
and machine learning (ML) algorithms (Amani et al., 2020). However, 
JavaScript, Python or R application programming interface (API) and 
the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE still 
requires a high-level technical expertise.

2.3. Additional geospatial data 

The core search tool in FIREMAP is based on historical wildfire pe-
rimeters  (2008–2023)  of  the  RDA  module  of  EFFIS,  which  is  a  main 
component  of  the  CEMS.  This  high-quality  database  is  the  main 
harmonized data source of wildfires in the European Union (Turco et al., 
2019). EFFIS BA mapping relies on active fire detection products from 
the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and a semi-automatic 
classification  of  MODIS  red-NIR  (spatial  resolution  of  250  m)  and 
SWIR (500 m) bands. Since 2018, the RDA incorporates S2 data to map 
BA smaller than 30 ha and refining the fire scars initially mapped from 
MODIS data. The EFFIS database is currently updated twice every day,

FIREMAP software is designed as a reactive web application devel-
oped in JavaScript, leveraging the Vue.js and Vuetify.js frameworks to 
build the GUI. The geographic information system (GIS) viewer of the 
GUI are developed using the OpenLayers library, in order to be able to 
create interactive maps and represent multiple types of spatial data. This 
design  allowed  to  implement  in  an  intuitive  and  reliable  way  all  the 
capabilities of the solution developed in the GEE JavaScript API. FIRE-
MAP software rely on an open source relational database management 
system  PostgreSQL  with  high  robustness  and  power,  particularly  in 
managing spatial information and large data volumes. This database is 
used to store user simulations and some complementary and necessary 
assets for the correct functioning of the application. In order to allow 
users to access the information stored in the database and perform some

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It would require additional information about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text.
