For  few-shot  learning,  CLIP  (Contrastive  Language  Image  Pre- 
training)  is  a  combination  of  two  transformer  models  that  was 
recently introduced. It consists of a text encoder and an image encoder, 
and is trained using contrastive learning to allow the image encoder to 
learn  visual  concepts  through  natural  language  supervision  (Radford 
et al., 2021). The image encoder maps an image to a vector that can be 
considered a robust semantic feature representation of the image, which 
can transfer to diverse tasks and often perform competitively with fully 
supervised baselines in a zero-shot fashion, without the need for fine- 
tuning.  CLIP  was  trained  on  400  million  images  from  the  web  along 
with their captions. While these models have shown impressive perfor-
mance, they are not perfect and have, for example, shown limited zero- 
shot  performance  in  detecting  tumors  on  x-ray  images.  We  aim  to

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network model that uses skip 
connections,  which  made  it  possible  to  get  good  performance  with 
deeper models than was previously possible (He et al., 2015). Training 
deep neural networks can result in exploding gradients, and skip con-
nections  were  introduced  to  ameliorate  that  problem.  ResNet-50  was 
chosen  for  comparison  as  it  is  a  proven  CV  classification  model.  It  is 
commonly used and provides a well-performing baseline. 

Inception-V3  is  a  convolutional  neural  network  used  for  image 
classification, that has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer 
(Szegedy et al., 2015b). The Inception-V3 architecture is built on pre-
vious Inception models, with the aim of making the V3 computationally

Recent progress in few-shot learning has been based on transformers. 
These  models were first  applied  successfully  in  natural language  pro-
cessing (NLP), and are used in popular language models such as Bidi-
rectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers  (BERT,  Devlin 
et al., 2019). They have also been implemented in vision models, such as 
the Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2023). The transformer 
architecture,  introduced  by  Vaswani  et  al.,  2017,  uses  an  attention 
mechanism  such  that  the  model  can  learn  what  parts  of  the  input  it 
should attend to. This allows it to outperform state-of-the-art models in 
NLP  tasks  without  using  recurrence  in  the  model  architecture.  Doso-
vitskiy et al., 2023 showed that convolutions are not necessary for state- 
of-the-art  performance  in  image  classification  tasks,  and  that  trans-
formers can perform well on these tasks when applied to image patches.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image or video frame. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. It is useful for identifying objects at a pixel level.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but this technique differentiates between instances of the same class. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would identify each car individually.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygons around objects of interest. It is more precise than bounding boxes and is often used for irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object. It is often used in facial recognition tasks.

6. Line Annotation: This technique involves drawing lines to mark lanes, roads, boundaries, etc. It is often used in autonomous driving applications.
