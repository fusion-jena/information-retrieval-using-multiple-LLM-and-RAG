%Query
Query: "What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The article does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
