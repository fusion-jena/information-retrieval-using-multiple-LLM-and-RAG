The performance of a neural network is traditionally improved by 
optimizing  its  hyperparameters,  which  influence  the  overall  model 
performance.  Using  different  hyperparameter  combinations  (e.g., 
combining  different  learning  rates  and  dropout  values)  will  lead  to 
marked  differences  in  the  predictive  performance  of  a  model.  As  a 
traditional  hyperparameter  optimization  method,  the  grid  search 
approach is widely used to optimize a model by comparing the values of 
evaluation  metrics  for  different  parameters  and  selecting  the  optimal 
parameters from a large search space (Bhagat et al., 2020). This method 
can optimize the model by comparing the values of evaluation metrics 
for different parameters and selecting the optimal parameters from the 
search space. In this study, the grid search method was used to optimize 
five of the MLP model’s hyperparameters. The hyperparameter adjust-

2.1.3. Data partition 

The raw dataset was randomly shuffled, after which the shuffled data 
were divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training set was 
used to learn the parameters of the model during the training process, 
and the validation set was used to evaluate the modeling and tune its 
hyperparameters. Finally, the performance and generalizability of the 
optimal model were evaluated using the test set. The data partitioning 
ratio between the training, validation, and test sets was set as 8:1:1 and 
the random partition was repeated ten times to reduce the influence of 
random splitting while ensuring converged performance (Geras et al., 
2017).

2.3. Model optimization 

The model performance optimization process is broadly divided into 
two stages, as shown in Fig. 3. The R value of the validation set is used as 
the performance indicator during the optimization process, whereby R is 
maximized  using  the  grid  search  method.  During  the  first  stage,  the 
neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers 
are  adjusted.  In  total,  60  sets  of  combinations,  including  one  to  five 
hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64–2048 (nth  power of 2), 
were considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of 
the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a 
total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

Helpful Answer:

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the grid search approach. Grid search is a traditional hyperparameter optimization method that compares the values of evaluation metrics for different parameters and selects the optimal parameters from a large search space. In this study, the grid search method was used to optimize five of the MLP model's hyperparameters: the number of neural network layers, the number of neurons per layer, dropout, learning rate, and batch size. The hyperparameter tuning ranges for these parameters are listed in Table 1. The optimal MLP architecture and parameters are presented in Table 2. The model performance optimization process is divided into two stages. During the first stage, the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers are adjusted. A total of 60 sets of combinations, including one to five hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64--2048 (nth power of 2), are considered. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size, to achieve a total of 192 combinations (4\*4\*3\*4).
