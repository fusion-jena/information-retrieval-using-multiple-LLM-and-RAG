Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

Throughout this paper, we use the term Same-Specimen-
Picture Bias (SSPB) to refer to a particular characteristic of
the datasets used for the training phase and the testing phase
of a supervised learning experiment with a global dataset D.
We say that SSPB is avoided (absent) if all plant images from
dataset D are distributed so that, for each specimen S all its
images are used exclusively in the training phase or in the
testing phase. Otherwise, we say SSPB is (potentially) present.

to understand at

2) Unbiased Dataset: For each species X in dataset D, we
tried to approximate a 70%-30% distribution as in the Biased
Dataset case. However, in order to avoid the SSPB, we used
the unique specimen identiﬁer to place images from the same
specimen in eiher the training dataset or the testing dataset.
This restriction alone could not be achievable if, for example,
one species X has photos of several leaves but they are all
from the same specimen. Our dataset D was created so that it
precludes such scenario, as there are photos from at least two
different specimens for each species X in dataset D. However,
this restriction clearly makes it harder to approximate the ideal
70%-30% distribution both, at the species level and globally.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, considering the common practices in machine learning, some possible strategies include using validation sets, cross-validation techniques, or monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., throughout the training process.

The biased dataset section mentions splitting the dataset into 70% for training and 30% for testing, which suggests that the remaining 30% might have been used as a test set to evaluate the model after training. But again, no specific details regarding the monitoring strategy during training are mentioned.
