samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

A recommender system, Fig. 4, ranks segment embeddings in order
of lowest certainty to highest certainty. Low-certainty embeddings
correspond to features on decision boundaries. The Euclidean distance ld
is computed between existing prototypes cd and the query embeddings q
providing both class suggestion and class probability using P(q ∈ d | ld)
= softmax(1 (cid:0) norm(ld)). The recommender ranks queries in terms of

This methodology has been implemented into the Listening Lab
Annotator Tool (McEwen et al., 2023b), shown in Fig. 5. The following
section demonstrates the functionality of the annotator and methodol-
ogy workflow.

Feature extraction model selection is evaluated in Section 4.1.

We compare three classification models - ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016),
Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021) and HuBERT
(Hsu et al., 2021). The classification models compared in Section 4.1
were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments automatically
generated by the annotator. The dataset includes 1130 possum vocal-
isations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset has an 80/20% training-
validation split which is used to evaluate model performance during
training. Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the
recommendation outlined by the model authors. Each segment has been
manually reviewed by a human. 500 segments are separated into a test
set containing 187 possum vocalisations and 313 noise samples. The
distribution of target features to non-target features is representative of
the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset
performance are reported. Using the test dataset we evaluate the model

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does state that the model performance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each of the three sample orderings. This suggests that some form of performance metric is being used to measure the effectiveness of the model. Additionally, the text mentions that the baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). This indicates that accuracy may be one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to determine if other metrics such as precision or recall were also used.
