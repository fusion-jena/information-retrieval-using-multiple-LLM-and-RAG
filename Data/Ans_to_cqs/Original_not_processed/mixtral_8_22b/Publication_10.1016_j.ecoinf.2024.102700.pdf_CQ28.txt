22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7

Science and SCOPUS), curating specific search terms and synonyms and
used Boolean operators and wildcards (asterisks) to account for word
variants and plural forms. Additional information on search strategy are
provided in the Appendix A along with Table S1 showing all the terms
included in the final search. The literature search was conducted in
January 2023 and considered all studies currently available in the two
databases until 31 December 2022. We did not add any language filters/
restrictions to the search strategy developed so that scientific literature
with an abstract in English but a full text in other languages was
potentially included in the search. Except for conference proceedings,
we did not include grey literature (technical reports, dissertations)
because we wanted to limit our search to the most relevant and
advanced scientific applications on the topic, given the extensive liter-
ature already available.

2.3. Screening process

Although to a lesser extent compared to dedicated surveys, the data
included in SDM modelling also comes from large databases or citizen
science social media records. These data are typically collected in an
unstandardised manner. However, in contrast to data from dedicated

enigmatic animals, as well as other cryptic species, offering insights that can guide researchers in making
informed decisions in the realm of SDMs.
