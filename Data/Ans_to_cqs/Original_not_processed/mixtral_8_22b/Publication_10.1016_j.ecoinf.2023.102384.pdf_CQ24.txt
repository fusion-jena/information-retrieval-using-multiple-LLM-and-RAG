we break them down into smaller patches. Specifically, in the training 
stage,  we  randomly  crop  square  patches  (experimenting  with  various 
patch sizes, namely 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels), and we apply a 
simple  augmentation  strategy,  flipping  the  patches  horizontally  and 
vertically with a 50% probability. On the other hand, during the vali-
dation phase, we divide the images of the validation split into regularly- 
spaced,  overlapping  patches,  using  the  same  size  employed  during 
training.  We  process  these  patches  individually,  reconstructing  the 
overall  output  by  combining  the  predictions  from  the  patches,  and 
subsequently, we calculate metrics over the complete image. For clarity, 
Fig.  2  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  this  procedure.  In  more 
detail,  for  the  solution  based  on  detection,  we  reconstruct  the  final 
global  output  using  non-maximum  suppression  among  the  bounding

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an essential approach used in smart agriculture to manage pest populations 
and sustainably optimize crop production. One of the cornerstones underlying IPM solutions is pest monitoring, a 
practice often performed by farm owners by using chromotropic sticky traps placed on insect hot spots to gauge 
pest  population  densities.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  modular  model-agnostic  deep  learning-based  counting 
pipeline for estimating the number of insects present in pictures of chromotropic sticky traps, thus reducing the 
need for manual trap inspections and minimizing human effort. Additionally, our solution generates a set of raw 
positions of the counted insects and confidence scores expressing their reliability, allowing practitioners to filter 
out  unreliable  predictions.  We  train  and  assess  our  technique  by  exploiting  PST  -  Pest  Sticky  Traps,  a  new

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values. However, they discuss employing a simple augmentation strategy during the training stage, which involves randomly cropping square patches of various sizes and applying horizontal and vertical flips with a 50% probability. This could potentially introduce some level of randomness into the training process. During the validation phase, they use regularly spaced, overlapping patches of the same size employed during training, ensuring consistency between the two stages. Nonetheless, it should be noted that handling randomness due to random seed values might involve setting fixed seeds or using techniques like ensemble methods, but these aspects are not discussed in the given context.
