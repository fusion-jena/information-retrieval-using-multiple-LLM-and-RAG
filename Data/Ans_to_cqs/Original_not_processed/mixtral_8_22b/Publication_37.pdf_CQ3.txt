The  automated  classification  of  migrating  birds'  ftight  calls  has 
the  potential  to  yield  new  biologieal  insights  and  conservation  ap 
plications  for  birds  that  vocalize  during  migration.  In  this  paper 
we  explored  two  state-of-the-art classification  techniques  for large 
vocabulary  bird  species  classification  from  flight  calls:  a  "shallow 
learning" unsupervised dietionary learning  method and  a deep con 
volutional  neural  network  combined  with  data  augmentation.  The 
models  were evaluated on a dataset of 5428  ftight  calls from 43  dif 
ferent  species, and  were  compared  against  a  baseline  model  based 
on  MFCCs.  We  showed  that  the  two  models  perform  comparably, 
yielding  a  mean  classification  accuracy  of 0.94  and  significantly 
outperforming  the  MFCC  baseline  (0.85).  We  also  compared  the 
performance of the CNN model  with  and  without augmentation and

Automated c1assification of organisms to  species based on  their vo 
calizations  would  contribute  tremendously  to  abilities  to  monitor 
biodiversity, with a wide range of applications in the field of ecology. 
In  particular, automated c1assification of migrating birds'  flight calls 
could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for 
birds that vocalize during  migration.  In this paper we explore state 
of-the-art c1assification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species 
c1assification  from  flight  calls.  In  particular, we contrast a "shallow 
learning"  approach  based on  unsupervised dictionary  learning with 
a deep convolutional  neural network combined with data augmenta 
tion.  We show that the two models perform comparably on a dataset 
of 5428  flight  calls spanning 43  different species, with  both  signifi 
cantly  outperforming an  MFCC  baseline.  Finally, we  show  that  by

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study explores two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls: a shallow learning unsupervised dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. These methods do not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
