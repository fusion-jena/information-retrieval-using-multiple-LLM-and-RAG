The effective solution of our tree-based FIS in Apis-FIS, the last node 
of  our  architecture  with  two  input  Prox-FIS  and  LCWT-FIS.  For  the 
output  of  Apis-FIS,  we  used  triangular  and  trapezoidal  membership 
function  with  five  fuzzy  sets  for  the  output  with:  “very  low  suitable” 
(VLS), “low suitable” (LS), “moderate suitable” (MS), “suitable” (S) and 
“highly suitable” (HS) for linguistic variables appear in Fig. 10.
