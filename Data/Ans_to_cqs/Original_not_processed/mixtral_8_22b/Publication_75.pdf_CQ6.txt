Our study was mainly to propose a new model based on CNN, which 
provides an efficient and effective approach for single seed classification 
and retrieval. Our network architecture, SeedNet, contains six learnable 
layers, 5 of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected. The 
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is applied to the output of every 
convolutional  layer.  Moreover,  we  periodically  insert  a  pooling  layer 
between successive convolutional layers, in order to reduce the amount 
of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control 
overfitting. More precisely, we employ a Max pooling strategy with a 
3 × 3 filter size, and 1 × 1 stride. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3. 
According to the chosen dataset, the output of the last fully-connected 
layer  is  fed  to  a  N-way  softmax,  which  produces  a  distribution  over 
the N class labels to predict, i.e. 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local

3.2.2. Retrieval results 

The retrieval experiments ensued the following strategy: every image 
is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in 
the database. Tables 6 and 7 present the retrieval performances of all the 
networks in terms of the four considered measures by choosing the top 
100 matches, i.e. η = 100, and the two chosen similarity distances.

We  now  describe  the  experimentation  conducted  in  this  work.  In 
detail, in Section 3.1 we first describe the experimental setup adopted 
for the classification and retrieval tasks. Then, we report the results of 
the  experiments  performed  on  both  datasets  and  tasks  with  SeedNet, 
compared to existing CNNs (Section 3.2). After a further comparison of 
deep  vs  machine  learning methods  in Section  3.3, we  give  a detailed 
discussion of the obtained results in Section 3.4.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, SeedNet. However, it can be assumed that some common preprocessing techniques such as data normalization or standardization might have been employed to ensure that the input features have zero mean and unit variance. This helps in faster convergence during optimization process. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming etc. could have been used to increase the diversity of the training set and prevent overfitting. But without more information about the exact preprocessing steps taken, these assumptions remain speculative.
