GEE  as  a  cloud-based  platform  makes  it  easy  to  access  high- 
performance  computing  resources  for  processing  big  geospatial  data, 
without having to suffer the IT pains currently surrounding them (Liang 
et al., 2020). Once an algorithm has been developed on GEE, users can 
produce  systematic  data  products  or  deploy  interactive  applications 
backed by GEE’s resources (Aryal, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). GEE consists 
of a multi-petabyte analysis-ready data catalog co-located with a high- 
performance,  intrinsically  parallel  computation  service.  It  is  accessed 
and controlled through an internet-accessible application programming 
interface  (API)  and  an  associated  web-based  interactive  development 
environment (IDE) that enables rapid prototyping and visualization of 
results (Gorelick et al., 2017). All these features made the GEE be used as

• batch 1: visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 2: twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 3: MS + spectral indices  
• batch 4: MS + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands  
• batch  5:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1 

bands  

• batch  6:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1 

bands + DSM

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, based on the mention of Google Earth Engine (GEE) being used for various tasks such as processing big geospatial data, producing systematic data products, and deploying interactive applications backed by its resources, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, specifically utilizing the capabilities of GEE. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains an assumption.
