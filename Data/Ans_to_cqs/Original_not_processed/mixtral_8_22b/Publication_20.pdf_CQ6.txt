A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of
references. We stopped the network training after 70 epochs (i.e. a
complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once), to
−5, an exponential
prevent overﬁtting. We used a learning rate of 10
learning decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50% and an Adam
Solver type as learning parameters. Those are classic hyper-parameters
for a fast convergence of the network without over-ﬁtting (Srivastava
et al., 2014). The weight initialization is also classic with a random
Gaussian initialization. The training lasted 8 days on our conﬁguration;
we trained and ran our code on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7
3.50GHz CPU and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images.

We used at least 2200 thumbnails per ﬁsh species class, and batches

We used a GoogLeNet architecture as it was the winner of the 2015
competition imageNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), an identiﬁcation chal-
lenge on 1000 diﬀerent classes. This CNN is composed of 22 layers. It
uses inception modules. Inception modules allow the network to use
convolutions of diﬀerent sizes (1*1, 3*3 and 5*5 pixels) and to weight
each of these convolutions. This network could thus account more or
less strongly for the context of each pixel, which increases the range of
possibilities to improve its performance during the training.

The model was trained using thumbnails of whole ﬁsh, part of ﬁsh species and
environment (T?). Raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision
rules: (r1) keeping most likely ﬁsh class if “environment” was the most likely
class, and (r2) considering “part of species X" equivalent to “species X".

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the data before training the deep learning model. However, some general practices can be inferred from the context. For instance, the authors mention using thumbnails of whole fish, parts of fish species, and environment, suggesting that they might have resized or cropped the original images to create consistent input dimensions for the model. Additionally, since the model uses a GoogLeNet architecture designed for ImageNet competition, it is reasonable to assume that similar preprocessing techniques like mean subtraction and data augmentation methods (such as rotation, flipping, etc.) may have been employed. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors, we cannot provide a definitive list of preprocessing steps involved before training their deep learning model.
