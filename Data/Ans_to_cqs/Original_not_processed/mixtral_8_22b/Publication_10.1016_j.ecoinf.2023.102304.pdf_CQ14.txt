Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

climate and vegetation cover conditions. By selecting the most appro-
priate  index  for  a  given  region,  the  LTR  algorithm  can  provide  more 
accurate results that are meaningful in the context of the specific climate 
conditions of that region.

In the process of the LTR algorithm, the performance can be signif-
icantly  impacted  by  the  way  in  which  the  algorithm  is  tuned  to  the 
specific  conditions of  each region. Parameter calibration  is needed in 
LTR applications as it is a parameter-sensitive algorithm (Quintero et al., 
2019). Table 5 lists all the parameters of LTR. Preliminary sensitivity 
tests  in  our  study  indicate  that  two  parameters—Max  Segments  (MS) 
and Recovery Threshold (RT)—are especially critical for the algorithm's 
performance. They are selected for further evaluation.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that preliminary sensitivity tests were conducted to identify critical parameters, specifically Max Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT), which were then selected for further evaluation. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed on these parameters, but the exact method used is not specified in the provided context.
