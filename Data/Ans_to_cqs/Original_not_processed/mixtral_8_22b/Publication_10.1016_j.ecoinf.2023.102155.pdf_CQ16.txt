3.1.3. Predicted intensity maps 

Figs.  3  to  6  show  the  predicted  intensity  maps  with  80%  hidden 
observations for the different combinations of lasso regularization and 
bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are 
shown in Appendix A.1.2. The following intensity prediction maps do 
not  display  all  methods  tested  previously.  We  focus  on  the  best  per-
forming methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT) as well

lasso  penalty  are  fitted  by  extending  the  methods  of  Guilbault  et  al. 
(2021) to be compatible with the ppmlasso package, as discussed in the 
Appendices. Here, we use the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to tune 
the lasso penalty, but other criteria are available in ppmlasso. New R 
functions were created to implement the extensions mentioned above 
and are presented in more detail in the Appendices. Both soft and hard 
classification  frameworks  are  available  but  the  results  below  will  be 
displayed  for  hard  classification  only  for  simplicity.  We  conducted 
simulations on R4.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2017) and performed 
1000 simulations using a high performance computing cluster from the 
University of Newcastle on 512GB nodes powered by 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon 
Gold (E5–6154) processors.

penalized  regression  techniques  such  as  lasso  regression  (Tibshirani, 
1996) and its extensions including ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 
1970) and elastic net regression (Friedman et al., 2010). These regula-
rization  methods  are  computationally  more  demanding  than  non- 
regularized  methods  but  they  allow  a  more  flexible  optimization  and 
provide other advantages. These methods impose a penalty on param-
eter  coefficients  so  that  they  can  not  grow  too  large.  The  penalty’s 
strength is a key component of regularization techniques that impacts 
model performance and various criteria may be used to tune this penalty 
(Hui et al., 2015). In addition to their use as tools to prevent overfitting, 
regularization techniques, such as lasso and elastic net, can help reduce 
coefficient  instability  in  particular  for  small  sample  size  and  select 
relevant variables while ridge regression and elastic net help to reduce

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used to tune the lasso penalty. This suggests that BIC might also be employed as a criterion to decide when training should stop. Additionally, the text refers to the use of penalized regression techniques like lasso, ridge, and elastic net regressions, which often involve monitoring validation loss or error during training. When the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, it indicates that the model has started to overfit the data, signaling that training should cease. Therefore, although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that validation loss plateau could potentially serve as one of the criteria to determine when training is complete.
