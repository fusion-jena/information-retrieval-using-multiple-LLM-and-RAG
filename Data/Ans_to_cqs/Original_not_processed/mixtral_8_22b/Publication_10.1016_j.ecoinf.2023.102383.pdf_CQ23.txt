3.4. Criterion for multi-scale feature map selection

compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 Ã— 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

for a model to detect and identify them. Under this condition, more CNN 
layers mean that more abstractly semantic information can be extracted. 
Therefore, FRC_ResNet152FPN has more advantages than others in this 
sense.

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, they discuss the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs), which help improve the performance of the model across various scales and sizes of objects. By combining feature maps from different layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), FPNs allow the model to capture both high-level semantically rich features and low-level detailed features. This approach enables the model to better handle objects of varying sizes and shapes, thus potentially improving its ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the authors compare several architectures with different numbers of CNN layers, including FRC\_ResNet18FPN, FRC\_ResNet34FPN, and FRC\_ResNet152FPN, suggesting that they may have explored various configurations to find the most suitable one for their task. Nevertheless, without explicit statements regarding the use of diverse datasets or validation methods, it is unclear whether these aspects were considered when developing the deep learning model.
