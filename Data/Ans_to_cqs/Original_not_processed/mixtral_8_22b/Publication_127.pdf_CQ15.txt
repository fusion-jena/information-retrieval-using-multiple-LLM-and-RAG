A landmark architecture for deep learning winning ILSVRC
2012 challenge (31).
Network in Network (NiN) is one of the ﬁrst architectures
harnessing innovative 1 × 1 convolutions (49) to provide
more combinational power to the features of a convolutional
layers (49).
An architecture that is deeper (i.e., has more layers of
neurons) and obtains better performance than AlexNet
by using effective 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlters (26).
This architecture is designed to be computationally efﬁcient
(using 12 times fewer parameters than AlexNet) while offering
high accuracy (50).
The winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition
(25). The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be
different. In this work, we try 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000
empty images. This dataset was then split into training and
test sets.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, some related concepts can be found. For instance, the paper [51] discusses identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization, which could imply the use of optimization techniques like gradient descent or its variants. Additionally, the context mentions the use of 1×1 convolutions in NiN architecture to increase feature combinations, and the use of 3×3 convolutional filters in another architecture to improve performance over AlexNet. These architectural choices might involve optimization techniques during the training process, but no explicit mention of these techniques is made in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the given context, it cannot be determined what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
