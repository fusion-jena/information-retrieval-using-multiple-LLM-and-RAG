Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

b)  Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization 
are  performed  to  address  the  diversity  of  training  data  and  data 
imbalance problems in classification tasks.  

c)  The preprocessed images are fed to the transformer-based network 
EMViT-Net for extracting the both local and global features of mi-
crobes from EM images.  

d)  The integration of the SCPSA block in the CNN module of the EMViT- 
Net makes the model more efficient in extracting depth-wise features 
from the images.  

e)  The  extracted  features  are  then  given  to  a  multilayer  perceptron 

module for final feature fusion and classification.  

f)  Finally, the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is evaluated on 
unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics 
accuracy, precision, recall and f1-Score. 

2.1. EMViT-Net

The  classification  performance  of  each  considered  deep  learning 
model is compared with the original dataset and augmented dataset to 
validate  the  performance  of  the  proposed  EMViT  on  the  imbalanced 
dataset. The results presented in Table 6. show the evaluated classifi-
cation performance of the considered deep learning model on the orig-
inal dataset and augmented dataset. It can be seen that the performance 
obtained by CNN models after augmentation is higher than the perfor-
mance obtained under the original dataset. The performance ranking of 
each  CNN  model  is  also  changed  under  the  original  dataset  when 
compared with  the augmented dataset.  The performance achieved by 
EMViT-Net  is  still  giving  the  highest  classification  accuracy  in  both 
cases. These comparison findings further transmit the advantage as well 
as the effectiveness of the proposed network.

the SCPSA block. In A block and middle block, a residual connection is 
applied at the end of each block to concatenate the extracted features. 
The used CNN model is capable of extracting 2048 local features through 
the function of the convolutional operation. Two types of pooling layers 
are utilised in this module: max-pooling and average pooling to reduce 
the dimensions of feature maps by looking at the maximum and average 
values. To deepen the structure of the CNN module some convolutional 
blocks and a separable convolutional attention module are added dis-
cussed in Section 2.3.1. which is a combination of pointwise and depth- 
wise convolution operations and allows to capture more local features 
from the images. This configuration of the CNN module has significantly 
improved the computational efficiency of microorganism classification.

Helpful Answer:
Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying random but realistic transformations to the existing data, such as rotations, translations, or flips. Normalization scales the input data so that it falls within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, which helps improve the convergence speed and stability of the learning algorithm. While stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially be used alongside data augmentation and normalization to further mitigate data bias and imbalance issues.
