The use of deep learning models has become prevalent across various 
scientific  fields.  Specifically,  these  models  have  demonstrated  excep-
tional  performance  in  image  classification.  Consequently,  numerous 
researchers are employing these models for land-cover classification and 
extraction of ecological information (Capinha et al., 2021; Jagannathan 
and Divya, 2021; Kırbas¸ and Çifci, 2022; Passah and Kandar, 2023). The 
U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep 
learning  algorithm  that  performs  classification  through  supervised 
learning  (Ulmas  and  Liiv,  2020).  The  model  was  trained  using  both 
training and validation data, and classification was performed based on 
these data (Kattenborn et al., 2021). Consequently, the availability of 
labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. However, in North 
Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field

the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on the application of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. While the context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), these are commonly used techniques in training deep learning models like U-Net.

Optimization techniques are essential in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function during the training process. They help adjust the weights and biases of the model to improve its accuracy. Both SGD and Adam are popular choices due to their efficiency and effectiveness.

SGD updates the parameters of the model by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. It uses a subset of the training data to compute the gradient, making it computationally efficient when dealing with large datasets.

On the other hand, Adam combines the benefits of two other extensions of SGD: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). Adam computes adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients.

However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated which optimization technique was used in this particular case. Therefore, further research or additional context would be required to provide a more precise answer.
