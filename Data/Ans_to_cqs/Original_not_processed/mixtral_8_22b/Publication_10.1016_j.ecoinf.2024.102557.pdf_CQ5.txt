Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to ecology, biodiversity, and conservation biology. Some of these studies may have utilized various datasets such as Mediterranean forest ecosystems or other relevant ecological datasets. The study by Christin et al. (2019) discusses applications for deep learning in ecology, but it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Similarly, the study by Wright and Ziegler (2017) focuses on implementing random forests for high-dimensional data without specifying the exact datasets used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context.
