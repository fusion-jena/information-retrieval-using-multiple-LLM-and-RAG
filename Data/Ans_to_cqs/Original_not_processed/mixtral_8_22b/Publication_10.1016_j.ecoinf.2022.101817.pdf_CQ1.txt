environment condition classification models, the potential influence of 
fish being in the extracted frames was considered negligible. 

The  12,000  frames  (8  frames  *  1500  videos)  extracted  from  the 
training  and  testing  dataset  were  then used  to  generate  five  different 
data sets using repeated random sub-sampling (see Fig. 4 (2)). Each of 
the  sets  was  further  split  into  a  training/testing  split  of  80/20,  con-
taining 9600 frames for training and 2400 for testing. Five CNN models 

using  the  same  model  architecture  were  then  trained  and  tested.  All 
models were trained over 100 epochs and returned an average loss value 
of  0.0126  with  an  average  accuracy  of  99.3%  during  training  and 
testing. Figures  for the  individual models are provided  in the  supple-
mentary material.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that video recordings or images might be one source of raw data since the study mentions extracting frames from videos. Additionally, the use of ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database, suggests that publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data. The paper by Dwivedi (2021) discusses the role of digital technology in freshwater biodiversity monitoring through citizen science, indicating that crowdsourced data collection may also play a part in gathering raw data.
