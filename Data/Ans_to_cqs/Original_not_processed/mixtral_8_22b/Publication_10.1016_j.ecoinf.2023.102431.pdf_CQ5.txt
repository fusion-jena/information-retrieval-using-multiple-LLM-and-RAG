To identify variables with the greatest potential to discriminate be-
tween classes of objects (e.g., species or fisher sex) we used a predictor 
screening analysis that uses bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the 
contribution  of  predictors  on  the  response  object.  For  each  response 
object  we  employed  predictor  screening  using  1000  decision  trees  to 
evaluate all 124 potential FIT metrics. We then used the top predictor 
variables to evaluate the dataset for two potential sources of bias, 1) the 
use of mirrored right front tracks instead of only left front tracks (foot 
position  bias)  and  2)  the  potential  for  bias  between  observers  when 
manually  marking  the  landmark  points  in  the  FIT  interface (observer 
bias) which is a somewhat subjective process. Foot position (left-front or 
right-front) of each track was recorded for each track during the feature 
extraction  process.  To  evaluate  observer  bias  we  had  3  different  ob-

camera trap images to create a reference dataset of known species for fisher and marten and known sex for fisher. 
We used FIT to geo-reference 167 marten and 367 fisher tracks (34 males, 27 females) using 7 landmark points 
and then extracted 124 morphometric variables (distances, angles, and areas) for use in identifying species and 
sex for fisher using linear discriminant analyses. Using a single variable, we found species classification accuracy 
>99% in distinguishing fisher from marten. For fisher sex identification our most parsimonious model consisting 
of only 2 variables achieved an accuracy of 94.0% for the training set and 89.4% for the test set. We also report a 
method to quantify classification uncertainty for each track. This method provides a rapid, cost effective, entirely 
non-invasive method to accurately identify sex that can easily be implemented in field studies.

Helpful Answer:
The study does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on creating a custom dataset using camera trap images of fisher and marten tracks. The researchers collected 167 marten and 367 fisher tracks (including both male and female individuals), and used these tracks to extract 124 morphometric variables for use in their linear discriminant analyses. These variables included distances, angles, and areas derived from the tracks. Therefore, the datasets used in this study were specifically created by the authors for the purpose of classifying species and sex based on animal tracks.
