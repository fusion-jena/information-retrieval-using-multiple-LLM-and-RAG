sation are outlined in Gavrilov et al. (2012).

to determine likely tracks by looking at the maximum change in TDOA 
(Nosal, 2013). For example, based on a swimming speed of 10 km/h the 
corresponding  maximum  change  in  TDOA  would  be  0.002  s.  Points 
satisfying the TDOA criteria are chosen as the next point in the track. If 
no points exist satisfying the criteria then the track is terminated (Nosal, 
2013). Similar criteria combined with visual verification of localisation 
estimates have been used by Guazzo et al. (2017) in the distinction of 
localisations for individual animals. In populations where vocal animals 
are generally separated by some distance and have small group sizes, 
this approach can be useful in guiding tracking analysis (Guazzo et al., 
2017). It is likely that advances in future methods of signal analysis and 
localisation will have decreased error and be able to separate individual 
animals with higher certainty.

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or using time-based splits depending on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed. Please refer to additional resources or consult with a domain expert for more accurate information.
