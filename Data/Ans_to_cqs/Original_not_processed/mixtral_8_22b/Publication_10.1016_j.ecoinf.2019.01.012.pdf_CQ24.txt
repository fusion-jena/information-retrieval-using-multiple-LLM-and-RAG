For the automatic classiﬁcation of woody vegetation, we developed
a CNN consisting of three convolutional layers and one fully connected
layer (Fig. 4). Each of the three convolutional layers was ﬁltered with
128 kernels of size 3 × 3. Average pooling with a 2 × 2 ﬁlter was
performed on each convolutional
layer. Besides the conventional
dropout on the fully connected layer (dropout rate = 0.7), we ad-
ditionally applied spatial dropout (Tompson et al., 2014) on each
convolutional layer (dropout rate = 0.3). This was in our case more
in preventing overﬁtting and improving generalization.

Dropout was applied on the training set only. We added a sigmoid
function to the ﬁnal layer, which is responsible for the binary classiﬁ-
cation. The optimal structure of the CNN was determined through a
heuristic trial-and-error process. We implemented the CNN using the R-
package “R Interface to keras” (Chollet and Allaire, 2017) and Ten-

The trained classiﬁer was then applied on whole repeat photographs, which were also split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. The classiﬁer predicts the output for each single

the CNN on the test images, we calculated averaged metrics from the
individual results. Averaged over all 34 images, the model reached an
overall accuracy of 87.7% and a F1 score of 78.2% (Table 1). With this,
the model lies above the accuracy achieved by weighted random guess
(wRG = 64.3%) and a majority class classiﬁcation (NIR = 73.1%).
Matthews correlation coeﬃcient reached a value of 0.66. Most confu-
sion existed between woody vegetation and other similar vegetation
types such as grasses and herbaceous species. Some further confusion
appeared between woody vegetation and wooden houses or cabins,
which are very common landscape elements in Norway. The automatic
classiﬁcation results for all test images are available as supplemental
material (Supplemental 2).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some strategies can be inferred based on best practices in machine learning and deep learning.

One strategy mentioned indirectly is the use of dropout regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. In the context, it is stated that dropout was applied on both the fully connected layer and each convolutional layer, with different dropout rates. Although not directly related to handling randomness due to random seeds, dropout does introduce controlled randomness into the training process.

Another potential strategy could involve setting specific random seed values before training the model. By doing so, researchers can ensure that their experiments are reproducible, as the same initial conditions will lead to identical results across multiple runs. While this approach doesn't eliminate randomness, it allows for better control and consistency when comparing models or conducting experiments.

Lastly, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods can help mitigate the impact of randomness caused by factors such as random initialization of weights or shuffling of data points. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several subsets and training/testing the model on various combinations of these subsets. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce improved predictions, effectively reducing the variance introduced by individual models. These techniques contribute to building robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
