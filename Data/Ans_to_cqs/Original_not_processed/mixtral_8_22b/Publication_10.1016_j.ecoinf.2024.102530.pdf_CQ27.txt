The rules for this Apis-FIS subsystem are: 
IF (LCWTSuit is VL) THEN (ApisSuit is VLS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is L) OR (DistSuit is UP) THEN (ApisSuit is LS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is M) THEN (ApisSuit is MS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is H) OR (DistSuit is AP) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
IF (LCWTSuit is HS) THEN (ApisSuit is HS). 
To  implement  our  FIS  models,  we  use  the  fuzzy  logic  toolbox  of 
Matlab 2023b. This toolbox provides large capabilities to choose several 
membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't enough context to provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. However, some common steps involved in deploying such models include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications.

Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored and transferred between different environments. Common formats include JSON, XML, and binary files. Once serialized, the model can then be loaded and used for predictions without having to retrain it each time.

Platform selection depends on various factors such as the size and complexity of the model, the available resources, and the intended application. Some popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include TensorFlow Serving, AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, and Google Cloud AI Platform. These platforms offer features such as automatic scaling, load balancing, and monitoring, which help ensure reliable and efficient performance.

Integration into existing systems or applications may involve writing custom code to interface with the deployed model, using APIs to access its functionality, or integrating it directly into the system architecture. Proper testing and validation should also be performed to ensure that the deployed model meets the required accuracy and performance standards.
