2.4.4. Model hyper-parameterization 

The present study employed a hyperparameter tuning methodology 
utilizing  grid  search  to  obtain  the  optimal  values  of  various  hyper-
parameter in order to improve the model(s) performance. Many studies 
have  employed  the  grid  search  approach  to  optimize  the  hyper- 
parameters  of  the  model,  as  this  technique  assesses  the  model's 

performance for each grid cell (Abbaszadeh et al., 2022; Uddin et al., 
2022a). 

2.4.5. Model evaluation

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study utilized a hyperparameter tuning methodology using grid search to find the optimal values of various hyperparameters. This suggests that multiple hyperparameters were considered, but their exact names or values are not mentioned. Commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type, and regularization parameters like weight decay or dropout rate. Without more detailed information from the original source, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in this particular study.
