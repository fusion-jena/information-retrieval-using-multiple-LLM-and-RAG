Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In deep learning, a deep network [30], [31] is consid-
ered better than a shallow network because it learns rele-
vant features layer-by-layer with more precision and achieves
high-level feature extraction (texture, shape, size, color), con-
necting a set of features to a label from a given set of input
categories. However, in practice, deep learning networks have
some problems. For instance, deep neural networks often
suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients, wherein a
deep multilayer feed-forward network is difﬁcult to train and

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

The model is then iteratively trained and validated on these
different sets. The training set is used to ﬁt the parameters of
the classiﬁer, whereas the validation set provides an unbiased
evaluation of the model ﬁt on the training set while tuning
model hyperparameters, such as the network layer size, ﬁnd-
ing the optimal number of hidden units, and regularizing the
model. Models with few hyperparameters are easy to validate
and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger
validation dataset is required. In some cases, the evaluation
is biased when a validation dataset is not incorporated into
the model conﬁguration because the model may perfectly ﬁt
the training data with high accuracy but may fail to ﬁt the
test or validation data. In such cases, k-fold cross-validation,
which is a resampling technique, is used to avoid overﬁtting;
the training set is generated with different combinations of k
groups (say 5 or 10, depending on the size of the dataset) as

• Train the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture on data aug-

mented from original images.

• Test the validation dataset and determine the misclassi-

ﬁed images.

• Randomly interchange the same amount of misclassiﬁed
validation images with the training images and retrain
the model again.

• Repeat this process until the classiﬁer adapts to the

speciﬁc target task.

• Fit the model to evaluate the test set.
In this way, the algorithm can tune itself and improve the
generalizability of spatial features to the previously unseen
domains present in the image.

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This encourages simpler models and reduces the risk of memorizing the training data instead of learning meaningful patterns. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the provided context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed ("dropped out") from the network during each iteration of training. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and promotes learning more robust features. Dropout effectively creates an ensemble of smaller networks within the main network, which improves its overall performance and generalization capabilities.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network to the loss function. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization discourages individual neurons from having too much influence on the output, thus reducing overfitting. It encourages the network to distribute the learned information across multiple neurons rather than relying heavily on specific ones.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention other regularization methods like L1 regularization or early stopping, they are worth noting as additional techniques to combat overfitting in deep learning pipelines. L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights, promoting sparse solutions and potentially leading to feature selection. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing, indicating that the model might be beginning to overfit.
