kernels. GoogLeNet adopted the Inception module, which is easy to use for network modification. It also removed the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, it used two auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence. As a consequence of the auxiliary classifiers, GoogLeNet is not as scalable as VGG. On the other hand, the depth of networks is a crucial factor that influences CNN performance [39]. Richer features of different levels can be extracted from deep CNN layers, whereas deep models are not easy to optimize. In many studies, batch normalization (BN) is employed to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. However, the accuracy often becomes saturated and then degrades (degradation problem) in the training phase, even though BN layers are used. ResNet [41] addressed the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. Two shortcuts (i.e., identity and projection shortcuts) have been

that is, the tree species training sample and its quality. As long as the tree sample can be measured well
in ﬁeld work, deep learning networks will work well. Further, it is beneﬁcial to collect tree samples
with the aid of crowd sourcing. In terms of the sampled area in species diversity, our method is also
applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the ﬁeld work
or the requirements of species diversity estimation.

6. Conclusions

The results of this study indicate the potential of deep learning methods for applications in
tree species diversity mapping with high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. Our proposed

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given information does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. The table only shows the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms - VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet. These architectures are known for their unique characteristics but the exact hyperparameters used during training are not mentioned. For instance, VGG16 is known for its simplicity and uniform architecture, while ResNet50 uses residual connections to improve gradient flow. AlexNet was one of the first successful convolutional neural networks, introducing ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization. However, without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used, we cannot determine the exact values for learning rates, optimizers, or any other relevant settings.
