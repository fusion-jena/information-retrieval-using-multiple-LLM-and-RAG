5.2. Deep GVI learning 

In  GreenCam,  we  measure  photo  GVI  by  SegFormer  (Xie  et  al., 
2021),  a  state-of-the-art  Transformer-based  model  for  semantic  seg-
mentation. As shown in Fig. 12, SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder 
structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with 
a  lightweight  decoder  (i.e.,  ALL-MLP)  that  is  composed  entirely  of 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

SegFormer offers a set of MiT encoders (marked by MiT-B0, up to 
MiT-B5) with increasing model sizes. To strike a balance between per-
formance  and  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  model  deployment  on 
resource-constrained  mobile  devices,  we  choose  the  MiT-B1  as  the 
encoder of GVI learning. We train the model on a server with an NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 3090 GPU (24 GB memory). The weights pretrained on 
ImageNet-1 K dataset are used to initialize the encoder and decoder. In 
training, we use the AdamW optimizer with the momentum parameter 
(cid:0) 8  to prevent division by zero.

We employ a cosine annealing schedule and set the initial learning rate 
to 0.0001. The model is trained on the UGE-D dataset for 100 epochs 
with the batch size of eight. We supervise SegFormer's training with the 
Cross-Entropy loss function, which is formulated as:

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the architecture of SegFormer, its usage in measuring photo GVI in GreenCam, and the specifications of the training process. However, it does not mention any details regarding the location or availability of the source code. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
