rice canopy coverage with the largest error in C3 and the smallest error 
in C2 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that RF is a machine learning model 
that is suitable for LCC estimation, but the estimation accuracy of the C1 
and  C3  regions  still  require  to  be  improved.  The  study  area  can  be 
divided according to crop coverage, and the overall estimation accuracy 
of the study area can be improved by searching for suitable VIs that are 
sensitive to LCC under different coverage conditions.

4.1. Rice LCC and rice canopy coverage estimation

The extraction of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for estimating 
the  crop  chlorophyll  content  in  the  field  scale.  Zhang  et  al.  (2020) 
pointed out that the end of July in Northeast China is the peak growth 
period of different crops, during which the physiological parameters of 
crops are at their peak (e.g., greenness and water content), which is the 
best  time  window  for  crop  classification.  In  addition,  classification 
methods, this study verifies the optimality of random forest classifica-
tion  by  comparing  multiple  mainstream  machine  learning  methods 
(including random forest classification, support vector machine classi-
fication, decision tree classification) (You et al., 2021). Therefore, for 
the Sentinel-2 images from 21 July 2022, we selected the random forest 
classification  method  to  extract  the  rice-growing  area  of  Qian  Gorlos 
County with a classification accuracy of over 90% (Fig. 1). Because rice

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide some insights into how the models were evaluated after training using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, and REP. It also mentions that the Random Forest (RF) model was found to have the highest accuracy among other models like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). But again, these evaluations seem to have been done post-training rather than monitoring the performance during training.
