Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, are generally trained based on the prediction loss
minimization. Let x and y be the input images and corresponding output class labels, the objective of
the training is to iteratively minimize the average loss deﬁned as

J(w) =

N

N
∑
i=1

L( f (w; xi), yi) + λR(w)

(1)

This loss function measures how different is the output of the ﬁnal layer from the ground truth.
N is the number of data instances (mini-batch) in every iteration, L is the loss function, f is the
predicted output of the network depending on the current weights w, and R is the weight decay with
the Lagrange multiplier λ. It is worth mentioning that in the case of GoogLeNet, the losses of the

two auxiliary classiﬁers are weighted by 0.3 and added to the total loss of each training iteration.
The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights.

training dataset for the CNN model: (left) patches of Ziziphus lotus class, (right) patches of Bare soil
with sparse vegetation class. The bottom panel shows the training-zone dataset with 100 Ziziphus lotus
patches labeled with a green contour and 100 Bare soil and sparse vegetation patches labeled with

4.2.3. Training Dataset for the CNN-Classiﬁer

The design of the training dataset is key to the performance of a good CNN classiﬁcation model.
From the 82 Ziziphus individuals georeferenced by botanic experts in the training-zone, we identiﬁed
100 80 × 80-pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for Bare soil with
sparse vegetation. Examples of the labeled classes can be seen in Figure 3. We distributed the
100 images of each class into 80 images for training and 20 images for validating the obtained CNNs
classiﬁers, as summarized in Table 1.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) like ResNet and GoogLeNet for training models based on minimizing prediction loss. Additionally, it mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for updating weights during training. However, there is no reference or link to any specific code repositories or platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
