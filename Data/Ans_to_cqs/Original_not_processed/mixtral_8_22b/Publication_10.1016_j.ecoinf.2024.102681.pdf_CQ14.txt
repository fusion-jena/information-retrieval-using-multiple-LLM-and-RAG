such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

time window. These carefully curated datasets were then used for the 
model training process. This process involved an iterative approach to 
extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model, 
thus enabling the identification and analysis of evolving patterns in the 
weights associated with each specific influencing factor. 

Fig. 3. Monthly- and seasonal-scale drought propagation times for four land cover types. (a) Cropland (b) Forest land (c) Grassland (d) Unused land (e) seasonal 
scale. The width of each violin plot indicates the probability of drought propagation occurring at the corresponding SPEI scale, and the SPEI scale corresponding to 
the maximum probability of propagation in each month, which is the time of drought propagation in that month, is marked by a solid black line.

Upon stabilizing the structure and hyperparameters of the model, it 
was  determined that the predictive  accuracy for drought propagation 
times is comparatively lower in Cropland (69%) and higher in Unused 
land  (84%).  These  outcomes  corroborate  previous  findings  about  the 
variability  in  drought  propagation  complexity  across  different  land 
types and hint at potential challenges in fully capturing the key factors 
unique to Cropland within our model. Further validation of the model's 
robustness and an analysis of the weight matrix in the fully connected 
layers underscored the significant role of soil moisture(Li et al., 2022b) 
and ENSO (Tang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021) in the drought prop-
agation processes for all Land Cover Types, with an observed trend of 
increasing  influence  from  these  elements.  This  highlights  the  impor-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the model was trained using an iterative approach to extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning might have been employed during this process. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot definitively state whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
