raw data are collected and transmitted back to a central data store. 
From  there,  the  data  may  be  analyzed  with  a  variety  of  different 
algorithms.  As  a  whole,  we’ve  found  this  approach  helps  to 
alleviate  the  sampling,  variability,  and  bias  problems  associated 
with traditional surveys. Further, the costs are reduced – the cost 
of  transporting  and  sustaining  field  crews  in  remote  locations  is 
instead applied to less frequently serviced sensor hardware. 

The  primary  challenge  for  this  approach  is  handling,  processing, 
and  analyzing  the  sheer  volume  of  data  generated  by  regional 
sensor  networks.  This  challenge  has  two  components,  one  being 
the technology infrastructure required to handle big data, and the 
other  having  to  do  with  the  amount  of  labor  required  to  process 
and analyze the data.

However,  the  rise  of  cheap  and  powerful  sensors  has  created  an 
ever-increasing data glut.  To be effective, these new tools must be 
coupled  with  new  automated  approaches  to  processing  and 
analyzing wildlife data streams. 

Here we describe examples of how we are leveraging advances in 
the areas of big data and deep learning to help researchers extract 
meaningful  information  from  the  torrent  of  new  sensor  data,  and 
improve the adaptive management of natural systems. 

4. DEEP LEARNING FOR 

BIODIVERSITY  
4.1.Big data infrastructure

Our deep learning approach has allowed us to scale projects by an 
order  of  magnitude  while  maintaining  costs.  For  example,  the 
technique allowed one client to grow the scale of a key project by 
two  orders  of  magnitude  from  600  hours  of  monitoring  in  the 
summer  of  2012  to  almost  80,000  hours  of  monitoring  in  the 
summer of 2014.  This effort has transformed their understanding 
of  wildlife  impacts,  and  doubled  the  funding  for  mitigation  and 
monitoring efforts in the area. 

As  the  field  develops,  we  expect  that  landscape  scale  automated 
sensor  networks  will  provide  real-time  data  for  assessing  the 
health  of  natural  communities,  and  measuring  the  success  or 
shortcomings  of  conservation  efforts,  allowing  data  to  drive 
iterative improvements in the field.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that they use a cloud-based system for storing and processing large volumes of data. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used based on the given information.
