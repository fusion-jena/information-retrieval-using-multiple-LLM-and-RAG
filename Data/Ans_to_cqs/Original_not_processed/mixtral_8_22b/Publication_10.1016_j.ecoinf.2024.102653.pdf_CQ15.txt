2.6. Performance metrics 

Conventional  metrics  were  used  to  evaluate  the  model’s  perfor-
mance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, 
Cohen  Kappa,  and  the  area under  the  ROC curve,  some of  which  are 
defined below (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

Machine learning coupled with big data technology has permeated 
agriculture  to  inform  crop,  livestock,  and  water  management  (Liakos 
et  al.,  2018).  For  example,  previous  studies  have  successfully  used 
artificial  intelligence  to  analyze  and  classify  animal  behavior  (Klean-
thous et al., 2022), and evaluate animal well-being (McLennan et al., 
2015).  Furthermore,  the  use  of  neural  networks  or  deep  learning  ar-
chitectures has significantly increased for solving entomological prob-
lems  (Marinho  et  al.,  2023;Peng  and  Wang,  2022;  Tuda  and  Luna- 
Maldonado,  2020).  For  example,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks 
(CNN)  have  been  applied  to  the  classification  of  fruit  fly  pupae  as 
parasitized or healthy (Marinho et al., 2023) and the recognition of in-
sect  pest  species  (Peng  and  Wang,  2022;  Tuda  and  Luna-Maldonado, 
2020).  Regarding  honey  bees,  recent  studies  have  proposed  deep

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The deep learning architecture described in this study uses the ADAM optimization technique. This method is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments. It was developed by Kingma and Ba in 2017 and is known for its computational efficiency and low memory requirements. In this particular case, it is being used to optimize the parameters of the recurrent neural network model during training. Other popular optimization methods include standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other variants like RMSprop and Adagrad. However, these are not mentioned in the given context.
