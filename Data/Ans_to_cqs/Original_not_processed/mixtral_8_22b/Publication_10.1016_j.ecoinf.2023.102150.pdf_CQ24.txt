The complete workflow is performed in the statistical software R (R 
Core Team, 2022), a programming language used by most ecologists (Lai 
et  al.,  2019).  Thus,  the  use  of  R  instead  of  python,  the  leading  pro-
gramming language for deep learning tasks (Raschka et al., 2020), will 
likely  lower  the  threshold  for  ecologist  of  implementing  automatic 
image classification in their workflows. Most available frameworks for 
automatic  image  classification  come  as  tools  with  a  graphical  user 
interface or as R packages. Such tools and packages are designed to be 
user-friendly with the aim to make machine learning models available 
for  ecologists  without  programming  experience  (Tabak  et  al.,  2020). 
However,  they  are  often  difficult  to  modify  and  researchers  are  then 
obliged to develop their own tool for their specific needs instead of using 
existing ones. Thus, we provide R-scripts for all steps of the workflow,

Helpful Answer:
None of the provided sources directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a fixed random seed value. However, some general principles can still be applied based on best practices in deep learning research.

One common strategy to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines is to set a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility of results across different runs of the same experiment. By fixing the random seed, one can ensure that the initial weights of the model, the order of input data, and any other random processes involved in the training process remain consistent between experiments.

Additionally, it is important to note that certain operations within deep learning libraries may not respect the global random seed. For example, TensorFlow uses its own internal random number generators for various operations like dropout regularization and weight initialization. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly set the random seeds for these operations separately if necessary.

Finally, another approach to managing randomness is through careful design of the experimental setup. For instance, conducting multiple independent trials with different random seeds and aggregating the results can help reduce the impact of randomness on the final outcome. Alternatively, techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping can also be employed to estimate the variability introduced by random factors.

Overall, while none of the provided sources specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, general best practices include setting a fixed random seed, ensuring consistency of random processes within deep learning libraries, and employing robust experimental designs to mitigate the effects of randomness.
