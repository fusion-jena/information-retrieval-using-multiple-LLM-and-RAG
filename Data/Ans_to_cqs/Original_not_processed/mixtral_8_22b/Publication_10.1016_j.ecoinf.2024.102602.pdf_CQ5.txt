2.5.1. Model selection and parametrization 

For  the  classification  task,  before  the  implementation  of  deep 
learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227×
197  pixels)  by  considering  the  mean  dimensions  of  the  set,  and  then 
normalized to the [0,1] range (Na and Fox, 2020). Then, six open source 
CNNs  were  selected:  VGG16  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2015), 
ResNet50,  ResNet101  (He  et  al.,  2016),  Inception-v3  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), DenseNet201 (Huang et al., 2017) and EfficientNetB0 (Tan and 
Le,  2019).  These  algorithms  were  selected  because  of  their  ease  for 
transfer  learning and  high  performance  on  similar classification  tasks 
(Arun  and  Viknesh,  2022;  Vallabhajosyula  et  al.,  2022).  For  model 
optimization, we used the Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 
2015), a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen 
(cid:0) 6 showing 
from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with and 10

with other plant species. Moreover, there are no other plant species in 
Portugal (our study area) with the same features as C. selloana. Both of 
these particularities may be the source of the high results observed in 
this study.

images

A.1b),  with  high  performances  (e.g.,  f1-score  values  above  93.09%; 
Table  4).  Unlike  the  training  task,  the  best  results  were  obtained  by 
(cid:0) 4,  in  terms  of  accuracy 
EfficientNetB0  with  a  learning  rate  of  10
(97.50%),  sensitivity  (96.00%)  and  f1-score  (97.46%),  followed  by 
(cid:0) 4),  which  also  showed 
Inception-v3  with  the  same  learning  rate  (10
high accuracy (96.88%), sensitivity (94.00%), specificity (99.75%) and 
f1-score (96.78%). In the case of the EfficientNetB0 model, only 4% of 
the  images  displaying  the  Cortaderia  selloana  were  confused  by  the 
model as showing no C. selloana (false negatives; Fig. A.1c). Likewise, 
from  the  images  showing  no  C.  selloana,  in  1%  of  the  cases  Effi-
cientNetB0  incorrectly  predicted  the  class  “With  Cortaderia  selloana” 
(false  positives;  Fig.  A.1d).  A  similar  pattern  was  verified  for  the 
remaining CNNs (see confusion matrices in Tables A.6 and A.7).

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any standard dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that six open source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected for the classification task: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These architectures have been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, but the authors do not specify if they use these pretrained weights directly or fine-tune them on another dataset.

It can be assumed that the authors collected their own dataset consisting of images of the invasive alien plant species Cortaderia selloana and possibly other plant species native to Portugal. This assumption is based on the fact that the authors discuss the challenges of identifying this specific plant species due to its visual similarity with other plants and the lack of other plant species in Portugal with the same features as C. selloana. Furthermore, the authors present results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score for various CNN architectures applied to this task.
