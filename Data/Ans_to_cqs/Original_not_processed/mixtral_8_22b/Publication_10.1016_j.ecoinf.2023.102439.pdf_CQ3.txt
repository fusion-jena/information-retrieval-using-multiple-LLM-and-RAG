to bolster the accuracy and reliability of rainfall-runoff predictions by 
harnessing  the  strengths  of  both  machine  learning  and  hydrological 
modelling  techniques.  Furthermore,  integrating  ANN  models  with 
diverse data sources and variables augments their capacity to capture 
intricate relationships and patterns. By assimilating various input vari-
ables such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and watershed 
characteristics, the integrated ANN-hydrological models adeptly grasp 
the nuanced dynamics of the rainfall-runoff process, offering invaluable 
insights for water resource management, flood forecasting, and hydro-
logical  impact  assessment.  Moreover,  ANN  models  trained  using  his-
torical  climate  and  hydrological  data  can  be  employed  in  drought 
monitoring to assess drought severity and predict its potential impacts. 
These models can integrate inputs such as precipitation, temperature,

et  al.,  2023).  These  ANN  models  draw  inspiration  from  the  intricate 
architecture and functioning of biological neural networks within the 
human  brain.  They  exhibit  remarkable  capabilities  in  deciphering 
intricate patterns and relationships in diverse datasets. Understanding 
the characteristics of the data stands as one of the most crucial factors 
that  impact  prediction  accuracy  when  selecting  an  appropriate  ANN 
method, as these models have consistently demonstrated their efficacy 
in simulating and estimating satellite data, yielding reliable results (Al- 
Dousari et al., 2023; Bharadiya et al., 2023; Lukas et al., 2023; Ma et al., 
2022; Souza et al., 2022). To illustrate, in the context of rainfall-runoff 
modelling, a multi-conceptual approach has been proposed, integrating 
ANN models with hydrological models like IHACRES, GR4J, and MISD- 
based models (Mohammadi et al., 2022). This synergistic approach aims

3. Results 

As indicated before, the ANN model utilised in this study comprises 
an  input,  hidden,  and  output  layer.  The  input  layer  comprises  three 
processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, 
and precipitation parameters. The EVI data was used as the output layer. 
The number of neurons in the hidden layer is a crucial factor influencing 
the learning capability of the network. Insufficient neurons may hinder 
successful learning, while excessive neurons may lead to over fitting and 
compromise the network’s performance (Çakır, 2018). In this study, the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally to determine 
the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we do see that the research involves utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for modeling purposes.

In general, data annotation refers to the process of labeling raw data so that algorithms can learn from it. For example, in image recognition tasks, bounding boxes might be drawn around objects of interest, which helps the algorithm understand what those objects look like. Instance segmentation is another technique where each pixel of an object is labeled individually, providing more detailed information.

While these specific techniques aren't mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially be part of the broader methodology if images were being used as part of the dataset. But without explicit mention, we cannot confirm their usage in this particular case.
