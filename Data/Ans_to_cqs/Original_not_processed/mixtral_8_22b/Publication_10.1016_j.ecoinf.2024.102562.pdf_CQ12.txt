makes it possible to obtain a more direct microbial community charac-
terization  and  in  the  future  create  big  databases  on  bacterial 
morphology. Cell morphology is not predictable from molecular data-
sets, and combining morphological data from soil chips with classical 
molecular  biodiversity  datasets  will  enable  a  deeper  functional  inter-
pretation of bacterial communities. We demonstrated the applicability 
of an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics and AI in mi-
crobial ecology research using a widely used model, Mask R-CNN. The 
synergy of AI and microfluidics allows biologists to design and fabricate 
complex  micro-structures,  visualize  the  activities  of  migrated  active 
microbes, and analyze characteristics of individual or communities in an 
automated manner. The versatility of the algorithm to adapt to different 
microscopy  settings  including  a  portable  field  microscope  allows  to

bacterial  abundance  and  morphology  for  work  carried  out  on  micro-
fluidic platforms. Statistical data of distribution and morphology of live 
microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is 
valuable  for  community  characterization  since  phenotypic  traits  of 
living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem-
ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep 
learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise (Berg 
et al., 2019; G´omez-de Mariscal et al., 2021; In´es et al., 2019; Midtvedt 
et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2019; Sys et al., 2022; von Chamier et al., 
2021). Our work showcases that the approach works under significantly 
different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-
tects differences among bacterial communities from different locations.

potential of deep learning algorithms in bacterial image recognition of 
environmental samples using these datasets and provide guidelines for 
dataset preparation and training. With the increasing user-friendliness 
of  deep  learning  for  biology  groups  without  much  AI  experience,  we 
found that image annotation equivalent to a few weeks’ work can pro-
vide satisfactory information on bacterial populations within the chips. 
This method is expected to be useful for environmental microbiological 
research  and  analysis  using  imaging  methods,  particularly  on  micro-
fluidic  platforms,  where  the  combination  of  controlled  experimental 
manipulations  and  monitoring  of  processes  with  high  environmental 
realism,  including  chemo-physical  conditions  and  biotic  interactions, 
presents significant potential.

include  flip, rotations  and  affine  transformation. We  then  trained the 
same dataset with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 
500 epochs. It is worth noting that the selection of image augmentations 
is  of  crucial  importance  to  improve  training  performance.  Multiply, 
linear  contrast,  sharpen,  emboss,  flip  in  horizontal  and  vertical  di-
rections,  rotations  and  affine  transformation  were  used  for  heavy 
augmentation.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that the authors use Mask R-CNN, which stands for Mask Region Convolutional Neural Network. This indicates that they employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture for their deep learning model. Additionally, they also mention using the ResNet-101 network, which is another variant of a CNN. Therefore, both instances suggest that the authors utilize CNN models in their pipeline.
