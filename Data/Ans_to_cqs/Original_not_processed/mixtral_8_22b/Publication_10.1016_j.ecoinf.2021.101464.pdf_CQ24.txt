where  NOOB  represents  the  number  of  OOB;  f(Xi)  represents  the  i-th 
observation value of OOB; fn(Xi) represents the prediction value corre-

observation value  of  the  random permutation  variable  Xj;  fn(X’i) rep-

3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, various strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during development and experimentation. This ensures reproducibility of results and allows for easier debugging and comparison of different models or configurations. However, once a satisfactory configuration has been found, it may be beneficial to introduce some randomness back into the system, such as through random initialization of weights or shuffling of input data, to improve generalization performance. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results, which can help reduce variability due to randomness. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization can also help mitigate the effects of randomness in deep learning pipelines.

I apologize, but there doesn't seem to be any information related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the provided text.
