predicted variables, as well as assist in combining multiple data sources 
to improve overall prediction accuracy (Deb et al., 2017). In practice, 
ANN models have often outperformed other conventional methods with 
respect  to  prediction  accuracy,  processing  rapidity,  and  nonlinear 
problem-solving capacity (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014; Yang et al., 2018). 
Conversely, the accuracy of ANN’s training process relies on the quality 
and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, the 
optimal  numbers  of  hidden  layers  of  an  ANN  model  depend  on  the 
problem itself and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance 
(Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Therefore, repeated training and testing are 
necessary  to  develop  an  optimal  neural  network  and  attain  highly

the  loss  function.  Moreover,  as  a  supervised  model,  it  operates  by 
modifying the weights and biases of the network’s neurons in order to 
minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target 
values (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The BP-ANN used here entailed an 
input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden 
neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron. The selection 
of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial 
and error, aiming to optimize the network’s structure (Supplementary 
material 1). The ‘neuralnet’ package of R 4.1.2 software, mostly applied 
for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, was consid-
ered here for developing a BP-ANN model (Yang et al., 2018).

regard owing to its greater accuracy in correlating and analyzing com-
plex datasets in a simulated environment (Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). The 
backpropagation (BP) training algorithm based on the Rectified Linear 
Unit (ReLU) activation function was used here for training the devel-
oped ANN model since it was recognized as one of the most widely used 
algorithms  to  robustly  model  various  types  of  regression  applications 
(Datta et al., 2023; Tiryaki and Aydın, 2014). Structurally, any BP-ANN 
consists of 3 kinds of layers, viz. input layer, hidden layer with several 
neurons relating to intercept synapses and output layer. It is a technique 
for  quickly  computing  gradients  of  the  loss  function  with  regard  to 
network  weights  (Erzin  and  Cetin,  2013).  During  the  training  phase, 
these gradients become critical for updating the weights and minimizing

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does highlight some important aspects related to preparing and training a deep learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANNs).

Firstly, the context emphasizes the importance of the quality and quantity of the sample dataset for achieving high accuracy during the training process of ANNs. This implies that proper data preparation and preprocessing might be necessary to ensure good performance of the trained model. Although not directly mentioned, common preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, and cleaning could potentially help enhance the quality of the dataset.

Secondly, the context discusses the use of the 'neuralnet' package in R 4.1.2 software for developing a BP-ANN model. While this information doesn't provide details about specific preprocessing steps, it suggests that utilizing appropriate tools and libraries can aid in building and training deep learning models more efficiently.

Lastly, the context mentions that the selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the network's structure. This indicates that fine-tuning the architecture of the deep learning model may also play a crucial role in improving its performance.

In conclusion, while the given context does not explicitly state the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it highlights essential factors such as ensuring high-quality datasets, employing suitable tools and libraries, and optimizing the model's architecture. These considerations can contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of deep learning models.
