Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, some aspects related to preprocessing can be inferred. For instance, the text mentions that the experiments were conducted on a small-sized dataset without data augmentation. This implies that the raw data might not have been expanded artificially to increase its size, but no information about other preprocessing techniques is available. Furthermore, the context discusses setting certain parameters like batch size, momentum, and penalty multipliers for L2 weight decay, along with applying dropout regularization. These are more related to the configuration of the deep learning model rather than preprocessing per se. Therefore, based solely on this context, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps typically involved before training a deep learning model.
