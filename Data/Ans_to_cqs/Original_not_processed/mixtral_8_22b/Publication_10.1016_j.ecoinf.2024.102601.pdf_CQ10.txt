poration of prior knowledge, which  is crucial when exploring contin-
uous parameters. Following the random search, we utilize GridSearchCV 
to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  in  the  vicinity  of  the  best  hyper-
parameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evalu-
ates  every  possible  combination  within  a  predefined  grid  of 
hyperparameter  values,  guaranteeing  that  the  optimal  parameter

2.3. Random forests

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-
