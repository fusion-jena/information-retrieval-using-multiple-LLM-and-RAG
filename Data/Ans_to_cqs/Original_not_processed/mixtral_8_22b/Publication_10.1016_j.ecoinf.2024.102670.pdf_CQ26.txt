An  issue  with  deep  learning  methods  is  that  it  can  be  difficult  to 
obtain enough ground truth data. Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-
sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, 
and demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of 
chromosomes.

Future  perspectives  for  a  more  versatile  removal  of  these  compo-
nents might include adding a user interface for easily marking desired 
components  or  the  development  of  a  more  specific  detector.  Deep 
learning is a paradigm that has been shown to outperform other methods 
in several domains. Indeed, (Xu et al., 2021) developed a Convolutional 
Neural  Network-based  segmentation  model  and  compared  its  perfor-
mance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in 
(Obara et al., 2012), finding a substantial improvement.

As  mentioned  in  Section  4.1,  performances  may  be  improved  by 
exploiting machine learning. Specifically, (Guo et al., 2021) extracted 
spherical patches around points of interest in the 3D volumetric images 
and used a deep learning-based model to classify the point of interest: if 
the point of interest was a cross-over point/overlap, the incoming fila-
ments were separated. With respect to the approach proposed in (Guo 
et  al.,  2021),  our  approach  is  similar  for  hierarchically  starting  by 
creating an overview and then locally analyzing the points of interest. 
Meanwhile, (Guo et al., 2021) analyzes all potential points of interest by 
considering a patch with a fixed radius, which may be advantageous in 
3D thanks to the volumetric information. We locally analyze the points 
of  interest  considering  their  respective  filament  angles  in  order  to  be 
able to identify overlaps with geometrical branch points far from each

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant insights can still be derived from the text.

Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data, often referred to as ground truth data, to train effectively. In cases where acquiring sufficient ground truth data is challenging, alternative approaches like crowdsourcing have been employed. For instance, Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-sourcing to obtain manual annotations for chromosome images, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.

To improve performance in various domains, researchers have explored machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning models. Guo et al. (2021) applied a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images, while Xu et al. (2021) developed a convolutional neural network-based segmentation model and compared its performance to other methods. These studies highlight the use of deep learning models to enhance image analysis tasks.

Although the context does not explicitly mention techniques for handling data bias, it emphasizes the importance of having adequate and representative training data for deep learning models. To mitigate data bias, one could employ strategies such as stratified sampling, which ensures that different classes or subgroups within the dataset are proportionately represented during training. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can also help balance datasets containing unequal distributions of classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data from multiple sources can further reduce bias and improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
