Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

extract  hierarchical  features  at  various  scales,  encompassing  edges, 
textures, and more intricate elements. By autonomously deriving rele-
vant  features  from  the  data,  deep  learning  eliminates  the  need  for 
manual  feature  engineering  and  reduces  manual  effort.  Furthermore, 
deep  learning  techniques  facilitate  the  generation  of  real-time  LULC 
information.  Recurrent  Neural  Network  (RNN)  models,  in  particular, 
demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns 
continuously. This adaptability enables the model to capture temporal 
shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Transfer learning techniques 
enhance the model's compatibility with new situations or different study 
areas. Additionally, integrating deep learning techniques with the GEE 
platform through the Google Cloud platform allows for dynamic LULC 
mapping by incorporating satellite imagery and real-time observations.

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically
