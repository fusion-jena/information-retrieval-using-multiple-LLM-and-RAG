thicker  the  line,  the  more  instances  of  co-occurrence  between  theme 
words  and  vice  versa.  As  relatively  low-frequency  keywords  are 
considered  ineffective  in  topic  detection,  previous  studies  (Dai  et  al., 
2020;  Liu  et  al.,  2023b)  typically  set  word  frequency  thresholds  to 
reduce network complexity and improve computational efficiency. Our 
study followed this approach. In word co-occurrence networks, closely 
connected  topic  words  can  be  viewed  as  communities  related  to 
contaminated sites. Modularity is a metric used to evaluate community 
division  quality  (Garg  and  Kumar,  2018);  its  calculation  formula  is 
shown in Eq. 3:

2.2.2. Social network analysis 

Relevant information reflected by a single independent keyword is 
limited. To present textual information in a more complete visual form, 
we need to determine the intrinsic connections between the identified 
keywords (Tian et al., 2021). A social network analysis can capture the 
potential interrelationships between different keywords. In addition, it 
is used to divide similar keywords into closely related communities and

uncover hidden information about a topic. A detailed introduction to 
social network analyses is included in previous studies (Dai et al., 2020; 
Liu et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2020). In this study, social network analyses 
were  presented  specifically  through  word  co-occurrence  networks.  A 
word  co-occurrence  network  is  a  Word  Graph  with  words  as  nodes, 
where co-occurring words (a pair of words that simultaneously appear in 
the same text) are linked through edges (Garg, 2022; Garg and Kumar, 
2018). This network assists in analyzing public opinion semantic fea-
tures and the potential interrelationships from social media. In a word 
co-occurrence network, the edge weights represent word co-occurrence 
frequency; the higher the frequency, the closer the co-occurrence word 
correlation (Fig. 3). We used the interactive platform Gephi to visualize a 
network: the larger the circle, the higher the theme word frequency; the
