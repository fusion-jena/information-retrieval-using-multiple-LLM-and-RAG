2.6. DNN architecture optimization strategy 

The  model  architecture  is  defined  by  the  number  of  layers  and 
neurons used for each layer. The arrangement of these two parameters 
strongly affects the predictive qualities of the model and it is a critical 
question that needs to be addressed in classification use cases (Ghanou 
and  Bencheikh,  2016;  Gupta  and  Raza,  2019).  Currently,  no  specific 
rules govern the optimal structure for a neural network (Zhang et al., 
2019).  However,  single-layer  neural  networks are  used  exclusively  to 
represent linearly separable functions, while multiple layers allow for 
greater  depth  that  results  in  better  generalization  for  more  complex 
problems (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this article is for Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification. This is mentioned in the title of the paper, which states "Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)." Additionally, the abstract mentions that the study focuses on optimizing hyperparameters for improving the performance of deep neural networks in land-use and land-cover classification tasks. Furthermore, the section titled "2.6. DNN architecture optimization strategy" discusses how the model architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, impacts the predictive qualities of the model for classification use cases. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the purpose of the deep learning model is for LCLU classification.
