scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

While  still  short  of  having  a  robust  and  standardized  biodiversity 
infrastructure (Heberling et al., 2021), there is great diversity of online 
repositories with taxonomic information and species occurrences data. 
Among  the most  important databases  hosting marine information are 
FishBase,  a  platform  that  hosts  information  on  the  taxonomy  of  fish, 
their ecology, trophic information, habitat, and history of uses dating 
back to more than 250 years (Froese and Pauly, 2000); and the Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a platform that stores and al-
lows for the free access to species occurrence records from around the 
world.  GBIF  is  currently  one  of  the  repositories  hosting  the  largest 
amount of such data in the world (GBIF: The Global Biodiversity Infor-
mation Facility, 2021; Telenius, 2011); and finally Ocean Biodiversity 
Information System (OBIS), which houses data on the occurrence and

Recently, however, a large number of online repositories have emerged, which catalogue, store and distribute 
biodiversity  information,  including  taxonomic  and  species  occurrence  data.  FishBase,  the  Global  Biodiversity 
Information  Facility  (GBIF)  and  the  Ocean  Biodiversity  Information  System  (OBIS)  are  part  of  these  publicly 
available  repositories  representing  a  variety  of  sources  that  have  exploded  in  number.  However,  despite  the 
incredible accumulation of biodiversity records, not all the information is actually useful, nor does it represent 
any new knowledge regarding global species richness patterns.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, the authors mention using data from two major biodiversity databases - the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). They also note that they followed the data curation process outlined by Zizka et al. (2020). Unfortunately, the context does not provide any specific details about where the final cleaned dataset or the deep learning pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
