where dh
dl represents the ratio of pixel sizes between images. The input
data for this study consists of fused predicted NDVI data with a spatial
resolution of 10 m; hence, the value is set to 1. μ(l) denotes the mean
value of the corresponding band. RMSE is the root mean square error. B
represents the number of bands, which has a value of 1 in this study.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on various studies related to NDVI reconstruction techniques and their performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and ERGAS. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available context.
