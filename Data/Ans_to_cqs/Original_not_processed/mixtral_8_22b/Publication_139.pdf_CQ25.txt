Pre-training on the both ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) and Inception 
(Szegedy et al., 2014) neural networks did not meaningfully improve 
classification performance, therefore this simpler architecture, similar to 
those implemented by (Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016) was used 
instead.

3.2. Validation database performance 

After training the neural network, the generalizability and robust-
ness of the model was further tested on the validation dataset. In the case 
of  the  small  portion  of  multi-label  data,  if  either  or  both  of  the  two 
labeled classes was output as a prediction, that prediction was consid-
ered to be correct. 

The network performance on all six validation days is summarized in 
Table 5. The average classification accuracy is 84.9%, with the lowest 
reported  accuracy  being  81.7%,  and  the  highest  being  88.6%.  Recall 
scores are fairly comparable.

Transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on one dataset is re- 
trained  to  classify  a  similar  datset,  is  one  convenient  approach  to 
effectively  utilize  the  power  of  CNNs.  Well-known  pre-trained  archi-
tectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have recently been 
used with great success for the classification of birds in soundscape re-
cordings (Florentin et al., 2020; He et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2017; 
Incze et al., 2018; LeBien et al., 2020; Sevilla and Glotin, 2017; Szegedy 
et  al.,  2014).  Such  networks  are  typically  pre-trained  on  large  image 
databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples 
distributed across 1000 classes (Deng et al., 2009). However, in cases 
where  targeting  foreground  species  is  the  main  task,  or  with  more 
acoustically sparse soundscapes, CNN architectures with far fewer (<10) 
convolutional layers have proven more than sufficient, and indeed, may

Bird  species  classification  challenges  in  recent  years  have  only 
reinforced the dominance of CNN-style models, with numerous different 
architectures  achieving  state-of-the-art  performance  for  a  variety  of 
advanced classification tasks. Most recently, BirdCLEF challenges have 
involved multi-species recognition from raw soundscapes up to an hour 
in length, as well as source separation in complex soundscapes during 
chorusing events (Kahl et al., 2019; Kahl et al., 2020). CNNs were also 
prominently  used  during  past  DCASE  challenges,  which  involved  the 
binary classification of bird presence/absence for a variety of recording 
conditions and with difference balances of bird activity (Stowell et al., 
2018).  These  efforts  highlight  the  important  role  that  deep  learning 
neural networks like CNNs are beginning to play in the field of acoustic 
ecology.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify bird species based on their vocalizations within soundscape recordings. This is evident through various mentions of its application in bird species classification challenges, such as BirdCLEF and DCASE, where it has achieved state-of-the-art performance for advanced classification tasks. Additionally, the use of transfer learning techniques, such as retraining pre-trained models like Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50, further supports the notion that the primary goal of the model is classification.
