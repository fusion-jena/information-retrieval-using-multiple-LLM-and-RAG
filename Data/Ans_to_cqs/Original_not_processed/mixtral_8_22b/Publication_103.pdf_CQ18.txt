the network. Therefore, a common practice is to initialize
the network by pre-training it on a big available dataset
and then fine-tune it on the scarcer domain-specific data.
Concretely, the methodology we used in our experiment
for transferring knowledge from dataset A to dataset B is
the following:

1. The network is first trained from scratch on dataset
A by using a multinomial logistic regression on top
of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification
layer.

2. The linear classification layer used for dataset A is
then replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the
classes in B. It is initialized with random weights.

3. The other layers are kept unchanged so as to

initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights
learned from A.

4. The network is trained on the images in B.

• H255.CR.CR: The neural network was pre-trained on
the Herbarium255 dataset to initialize the weights,
fine-tuned on the Costa-Rica leaf scans training set
(70%) and tested on the Costa-Rica leaf scans test set
(30%).

• H255I.CR.CR: The neural network was pre-trained
on ImageNet and then on Herbarium255 before
being fine-tuned on the Costa-Rica leaf scans training
set (70%) and finally tested on the Costa-Rica leaf
scans test set (30%).

• R.PC.PC: The neural network was initialized

randomly, trained on the PlantCLEF training set
(80%) and tested on the PlantCLEF test set (20%).
• I.PC.PC: The neural network was pre-trained on the
generalist dataset ImageNet to initialize the weights,
fine-tuned on the PlantCLEF training set (80%) and
tested on the PlantCLEF test set (20%).

• H1K.PC.PC: The neural network was pre-trained on
the Herbarium1K dataset to initialize the weights,
fine-tuned on the PlantCLEF training set (80%) and
tested on the PlantCLEF test set (20%).

very beginning the weights of ImageNet were used.
For example, H1KI.PC.PC means the transfer
learning was progressive, done from ImageNet, to
Herbarium1K, to PlantCLEF, and tested with
PlantCLEF data.

• Initialization: weights used to initialize the model.
• Training: training set used (e.g., Herbarium255

training set, PlantCLEF training set, etc.)

• Testing: test set used (e.g., Herbarium255 test set,

PlantCLEF test set, etc.)

• Top-1/Top-5: accuracy achieved with top-1 and

top-5 best predictions, respectively.

no collector was shared by the training and testing sets
to avoid bias in the data. The following four experiments
were conducted:

• R.H255.H255: The neural network was initialized

randomly, trained on the Herbarium255 training set
(70%), and tested on the Herbarium255 test set (30%).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on standard machine learning practices, it can be inferred that the model performance might have been monitored through metrics such as loss or accuracy on validation datasets during each epoch of training. Additionally, techniques like early stopping could also have been employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
