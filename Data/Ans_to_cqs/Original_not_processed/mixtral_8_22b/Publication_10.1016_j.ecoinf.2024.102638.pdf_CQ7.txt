Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

hyperparameter optimisation process, the performance metrics detailed 
in Section 2.5 are meticulously evaluated using the designated test set. 
Subsequently, based on the performance metrics obtained, we discern 
and  select  the  most  effective  models  for  each  target  variable.  For  an 
illustrative overview of this model selection process, kindly refer to the 
visual representation provided in Fig. 4.

Helpful Answer: The dataset is divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of the data, and a test set representing the remaining 20%. This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. Randomization helps to preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model. Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation is used during the hyperparameter optimization process.
