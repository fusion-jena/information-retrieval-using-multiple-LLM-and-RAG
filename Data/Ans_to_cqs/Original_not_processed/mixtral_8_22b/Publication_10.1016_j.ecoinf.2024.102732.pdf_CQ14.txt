2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

Helpful Answer:
The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models are optimized using a grid search methodology. Grid search is a technique used to identify the optimal values for hyperparameters by exhaustively searching over a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. In this process, all possible combinations of hyperparameters are tried out, and the one that gives the highest score is picked.

For RF, the key parameters for tuning include "ntree," which controls the number of trees, and "mtry," which determines the number of variables sampled at each split. These parameters are optimized using grid search. Variable importance is then assessed using "percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" indices.

On the other hand, important indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include "Gain" and "Frequency." The key parameters for tuning XGBoost include "nrounds" (boosting iterations), "max depth," "min child weight," "gamma," and "subsample." Again, a grid search methodology is employed to find the best parameter combination, enhancing the model’s performance.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) tuning involves selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter, which balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of SVR allows it to handle complex decision boundaries effectively.
