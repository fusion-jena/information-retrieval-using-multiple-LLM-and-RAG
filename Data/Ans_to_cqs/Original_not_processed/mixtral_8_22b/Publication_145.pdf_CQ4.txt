3.4. Data Augmentation

Data augmentation was applied randomly to the input images, including 0–360◦ rotations,
horizontal and vertical ﬂips, and changes in the brightness, saturation and hue, by modulating
the current values between 95 and 110% for brightness, 95–105% for saturation and 99–101% for hue
(as changes in the plant hues are not expected).

3.5. Segmentation Accuracy Assessment

ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including very high-resolution imagery, achieving
accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species
mapping in tropical forests, that was in the past only possible on small scale with traditional machine
learning methods [15,16] is now feasible on a large scale (>5000 km2) with a deep learning method
called U-net [17–20].

as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted
masks [50–52]. We used the optimizer RMSprop (unpublished, adaptive learning rate method proposed
by Geoff Hinton here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. We trained our network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.

the validation dataset and the model segmented 1195 objects.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include 0-360° rotations, horizontal and vertical flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. Brightness was modulated between 95 and 110%, saturation between 95 and 105%, and hue between 99 and 101%. These techniques were applied randomly to the input images.
