The  forecast  performance  of  deep  learning  models  varies  across 
different Chl concentration regions. In the high Chl concentration region 
(point A), the R2  values are the lowest, while in the low Chl concen-
tration region (point C), the R2 values are the highest (Fig. 6). Among the 
models,  the  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  consistently  achieves  the  highest  R2 
values  across  all  regions,  whereas  the  CNN  model  has  the  lowest  R2 
values (Fig. 6).

3.1. Deep learning models performance 

Fig. 3 shows the Chl forecast results for the training data at points A, 
B, and C in 2021. The forecast time series from all models align closely 
with satellite observations, exhibiting minimal errors. The R2 values of 
the CNN model exceed 0.8 at points A and B, and 0.9 at point C. Both the 
LSTM  and  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  models  achieve  R2  values  over  0.9  for 
points A, B, and C. During training, All models—CNN, LSTM, and hybrid 
CNN-LSTM—effectively captured the patterns and trends in the training 
data. 

This study presented the Chl forecast results in the Zhoushan fishery 
in 2022 using various deep learning models. Fig. 4 displays boxplots of 
the evaluation metrics (R2 and RMSE) based on forecasts from 3130 grid 
points. The average R2 values for the CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM 
models  were  0.31,  0.40,  and  0.43,  respectively.  Correspondingly,  the

average  RMSE  values  were  1.85  μg/L,  1.55  μg/L,  and  1.51  μg/L. 
Notably, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved the highest R2 and the 
lowest  RMSE,  while  the  CNN  model  exhibited  the  lowest  R2  and  the 
highest RMSE (Fig. 4). Additionally, both the CNN and LSTM models had 
a significant number of high RMSE outliers, exceeding those observed in 
the hybrid CNN-LSTM models (Fig. 4b).

Helpful Answer:
In this study, two main metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). These metrics help assess how well the forecasted chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations match with the actual satellite observations.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated by taking the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance. In Table 1, RMSE values are given in units of micrograms per liter (µg/L).

Coefficient of Determination (R2): Also known as the R-squared value, this metric represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model. Higher R2 values suggest a stronger relationship between the predicted and actual values. In Figure 3, R2 values are shown for different models and locations (points A, B, and C).

These metrics are used to compare the performance of three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Based on these evaluations, it was found that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model generally performed best, achieving higher R2 values and lower RMSE compared to the other models.
