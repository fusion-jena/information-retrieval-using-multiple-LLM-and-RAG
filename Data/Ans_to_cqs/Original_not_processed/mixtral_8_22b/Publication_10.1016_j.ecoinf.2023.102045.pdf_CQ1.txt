different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that maps are generalizations and imperfect representations of the features they show due to data gathering and representation processes. These processes could involve various methods for collecting raw data, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can gather human input on specific topics, while sensors collect environmental data like temperature, humidity, or air quality. Public datasets provide open access to large amounts of pre-existing data, often collected by government agencies or research institutions. In the field of computational ecology, these methods could be employed to gather data on factors affecting ecosystems, such as climate change or invasive species.
