1. Introduction  

Grasslands  are  among  the  leading  terrestrial  ecosystems  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022), 

occupying more than 40% of the world’s terrestrial area, a third of the agricultural area 

in  Europe,  and  storing  about  a  third  of  the  world’s  terrestrial  biomass  stock  (O‘Mara, 

2012; Stumpf et al., 2020 Bar-On et al., 2018; Erb et al., 2017).  

Moreover, grassland agroecosystems are of significant importance in the production of

the training subset. In this case, the total number of samples used for validation is 8. 

System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) (Conrad, 

2015) was employed to perform classification utilising the RF technique, based on Red 

Gren Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May.In this study, the maximum 

shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 

to 50. Finally, the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree 

depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The regression

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details regarding the use of techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has approximately the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This helps maintain the balance between different classes while creating training and testing datasets.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic examples are created from existing minority class instances to increase their representation in the dataset. On the other hand, undersampling reduces the majority class instances to achieve a balanced distribution of classes. Both these techniques help mitigate the effects of class imbalance in the dataset.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and environments to ensure the model generalizes well across different scenarios. This can also involve collecting data from underrepresented groups to reduce any inherent biases present in the dataset.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are widely adopted approaches to tackle data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
