Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The salmon scale image datasets used for training and testing the deep learning pipeline are available via DOI links. However, it appears that the specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF were not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Nonetheless, one can access the datasets using the provided DOIs:

1. Salmon scale 9056 image dataset: <https://doi.org/10.21335/NMDC-1050865887>
2. Extra 150 images dataset: <https://doi.org/10.21335/335/NMDC-1462728994>
