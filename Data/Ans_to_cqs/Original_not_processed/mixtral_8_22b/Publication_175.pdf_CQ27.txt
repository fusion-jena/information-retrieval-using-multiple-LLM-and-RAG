Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

1)  We  trained  a  classic  DL  algorithms  architecture  with  our  biggest 

dataset AT0 as a baseline for the DL accuracy;  

2)  We  trained  the  same  DL  architecture  with  the  same  hyper- 
parameters (e.g. model architecture and training process) but on a 
much  more  limited  dataset  (AT1).  Hyper-parameters  are  the  pa-
rameters  defining  the  architecture (number of  layers, number and 
size of convolutions, connections between layers) and the training 
process  of  a  Deep  Model  (learning  rate,  neurone  activation,  back- 
propagation compotation).;  

3)  We trained the same DL architecture with limited datasets obtained 
by  subsampling  T0  to  250  and  500  images  per  class  (here  after 
“species” when we are referring to our experiments), corresponding 
to 2500 and 5000 thumbnails in AT0;

a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1–5 thumbnails per 
class.

3. Results 

The  deep  ResNet  model  trained  on  the  large  AT0  dataset  (3458 
natural thumbnails in average per species) during the first experiment 
obtained a mean accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct classification) of 
78.00%  (standard  deviation  (SD)  of  15.16%)  on  T2  test-dataset 
(Table  2).  With  this  model,  accuracy  varied  among  species  between 
54.14% (Naso brevirostris) and 99.07% (Abudefduf vagiensis). The same

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what specific steps were taken to serialize the model or select a platform for deployment. Further details would be required to provide a complete response.
