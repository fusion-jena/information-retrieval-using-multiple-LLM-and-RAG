a deep learning model that works on multiple levels.

In the proposed study, an attempt is made to use convolution features 
to extract high-level visual information from RGB plant images by using 
a ResNet18 architecture (Gao et al., 2021). The procedure begins with 
the input image being subjected to a sequence of operations and length 
in both the X and Y axes. After that, there is a max-pooling layer with a 
kernel size of 3 × 3, a stride length of 2, zero padding of (1), a batch 
normalization layer, and ReLU activation. In addition, we set up specific 
training settings to maximize the model’s efficiency which include 64 
batches, momentum  of 0.95,  learning rate of 0.012,  Adam optimizer, 
weight  decay  of  0.01,  and  epsilon  of  ε  = 0.000001.  In  the  proposed 
study, the training settings of the hyperparameters represent the entire 
training setup and are not specific to the residual blocks. After that, we 
perform  downsampling  by  incorporating  four  residual  blocks,  each

Helpful Answer:
The provided context mentions several studies that involve training deep learning models for various tasks related to plant identification and classification. However, the exact preprocessing steps used in these studies are not explicitly stated. Nevertheless, some general preprocessing techniques commonly used before training deep learning models can be mentioned. These may include:

* Normalization: This involves adjusting the range of pixel values in the input images to a standard scale, typically between 0 and 1. This helps to ensure that all input features have similar magnitudes, preventing any feature from dominating the others during training.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, this technique involves rescaling the input data to fit within a certain range. For example, if the input data consists of images with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, they could be scaled down to a smaller range such as 0 to 1.
* Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or noisy data from the input dataset. For instance, if the input images contain unwanted objects or background elements, they should be removed or cropped out before feeding them into the model.
* Augmentation: This technique involves artificially increasing the size of the input dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images. Common transformations include rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting. This helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

While the above preprocessing techniques are commonly used, it is important to note that the choice of preprocessing steps depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. Therefore, it is recommended to experiment with different combinations of preprocessing techniques to determine the optimal approach for a given problem.
