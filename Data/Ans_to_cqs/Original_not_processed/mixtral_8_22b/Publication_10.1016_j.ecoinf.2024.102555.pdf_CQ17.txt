From  the  perspective  of  human  activities,  during  the  1980s  and 
1990s, with the pursuit of short-term benefits for residents and the lack 
of effective protection and management measures, vegetation degrada-
tion in parts of China were artificially exacerbated by overgrazing, un-
reasonable  agriculture,  timber  harvesting,  Chinese  herbal  medicine 
collection, and gold mining, with excessive grazing as the most impor-
tant reason (Wang et al., 2008). Fang et al. (2010) pointed out prior to 
2000, central China suffered from the greatest grazing pressure. China 
gone  through  significant  environmental  alterations  due  to  human  ac-
tivities  since  2000.  And  improvement  is  likely  to  be  the  result  of 
ecological construction programs. After 2000, positive human impacts 
on  NDVI  were  identified  after  2000,  these  positive  human  activities 
could even offset the negative impact due to climatic effects. This result

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned do not directly discuss the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less sensitive to the specific weights of individual neurons.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of all the weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights and prevents any single weight from becoming too large, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Other regularization techniques include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping when it starts to increase, indicating that the model is beginning to overfit. Data augmentation generates additional training examples by applying random transformations to existing data, increasing the diversity of the training set and helping to reduce overfitting. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, improving the stability of the learning process and reducing the risk of overfitting.
