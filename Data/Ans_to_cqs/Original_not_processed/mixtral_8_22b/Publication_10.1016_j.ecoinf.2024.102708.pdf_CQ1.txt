This resulted in a dataset consisting of 3643 tiles for the Scoble site 
(758 containing Pacific oysters, 2885 without Pacific oysters) and 7571 
tiles  for  the  Collapit  site  (879  containing  Pacific  oysters  and  6692 
without Pacific oysters). 

2.3. Validation and training datasets 

To create the training and validation datasets, the tiles containing 
Pacific oysters were split into 70% training, and 30% validation. Data 
augmentation  was  used  to  increase  the  size  of  the  training  dataset, 
through random variations and manipulations to the data. Augmenta-
tions  were  applied  in  a  random  order.  The  list  of  augmentations  is 
described in Table 1. 

The training data set had five augmented images created per original 
tile  to  create  an  additional  5735  tiles  split  between  the  two  sites.

Drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific 
oysters to manage their expansion into protected areas

The  authors  recognize  several  other  limitations  that  could  be 
addressed in follow up projects. First, only two types of neural network 
architectures  were  used,  whereas  additional  benchmarking  could  be 
performed  with  other  types  of  ResNets,  DenseNets  and  transformer 
based models. Secondly, this study does not address the individual in-
sights from the trained models, and the pros and cons of architectures 
and hyperparameters in recognizing specific features of Pacific oysters 
across  mudflats  and  rocky  shore  imagery.  Thirdly,  ablations  studies 
should  be  performed,  showcasing  the  possibilities  for  reducing  the 
complexities of neural network layers and speeding up the computation 
times. And fourthly, if left unmanaged, Pacific oysters can create oyster 
reefs and very dense clusters where younger oysters grow on top of the 
older. In such cases, no gaps are found in the cluster and only the oysters

Helpful Answer:

The article discusses using drone imagery for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters. This suggests that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through remote sensing via drones. The drones capture high-resolution images which are then processed and analyzed using convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of deep learning algorithm.

From the abstract, we learn that the research focuses on managing the expansion of invasive Pacific oysters into protected areas. To achieve this, they collected drone imagery from two different sites - Scoble and Collapit. These images were divided into smaller sections called 'tiles', some of which contained Pacific oysters while others did not.

The number of tiles collected from each site is mentioned in the text: 3643 tiles from the Scoble site (with 758 containing Pacific oysters) and 7571 tiles from the Collapit site (with 879 containing Pacific oysters). This indicates that the researchers gathered a substantial amount of raw data using drones.

Furthermore, the article mentions that data augmentation techniques were employed to expand the training dataset by creating modified versions of existing images. However, it appears that these modifications were made solely to the images containing Pacific oysters, rather than being applied to all collected images.

In summary, the primary method used for gathering raw data in this deep learning pipeline is capturing high-resolution drone imagery. This approach allows for efficient collection of large amounts of visual data, which can subsequently be processed and analyzed using CNN algorithms to map the density of wild Pacific oysters.
