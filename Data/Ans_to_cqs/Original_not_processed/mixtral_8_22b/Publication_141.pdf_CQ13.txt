2014), which is suggested for relatively small datasets such as ours
(Ng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018). The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained
using a two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage only a top classiﬁer
(fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from
processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the net-
work. In the second stage, an adjustment of the network in a ﬁne-
tuned manner (using smaller learning rates) is done by training it
as a whole. A two phase approach was used to speed up the process
by preserving pretrained encoder weights in the ﬁrst phase of the
training and achieve optimal model performance using the second
phase. We also applied data augmentation by randomly deforming
input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size.
Additionally, dropout techniques (Hinton et al., 2012) were applied
to extracted features to enhance model robustness.

The implementation of the CNN classiﬁer was done in Python
programming language (https://www.python.org/), using the
Keras high level deep learning library (https://keras.io/), and Ten-
sorFlow with graphical processing unit (GPU) execution as the
back-end engine (https://www.tensorﬂow.org/). The regions of
the images most informative for the decision making process in
the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-
weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM; (Selvaraju et al.,
2017)). As an output, heatmaps were generated that indicated
important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine
the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, we can infer some general information about the model's configuration.

The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model uses a two-stage training process. In the first stage, only the top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that transfer learning was employed, possibly using a well-known architecture like VGG16 or ResNet.

In the second stage, the entire network is fine-tuned using smaller learning rates. This indicates that the initial learning rate might have been higher during the first stage, but without explicit values, we cannot confirm this assumption. Additionally, the use of smaller learning rates during fine-tuning implies that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer or its variants could have been utilized, as they are commonly paired with learning rate schedules.

Furthermore, the context states that data augmentation was applied by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This technique helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. Dropout techniques were also implemented to enhance model robustness, suggesting that regularization methods were considered during the development of the deep learning model.

Lastly, the model was developed using Python programming language, Keras high-level deep learning library, and TensorFlow with GPU execution as the backend engine. These tools offer various options for setting hyperparameters, including different optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, and epoch numbers. Without more specific information, however, we cannot definitively state the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
