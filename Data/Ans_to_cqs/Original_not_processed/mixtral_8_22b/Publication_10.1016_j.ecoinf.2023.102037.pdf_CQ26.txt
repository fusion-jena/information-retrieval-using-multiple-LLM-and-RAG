2.3. Data splitting and image tiling

ayanan, 2022). In our previous research (Kalfas et al., 2021; Kalfas et al., 
2022), we showed that model performance can be highly overestimated 
when weak validation procedures – like random data splitting- are fol-
lowed.  Despite  taking  the  above  limitations  into  consideration,  other 
studies  still  only  focused  on  datasets  where  insect  classes  were  quite 
broad – insect order or family level, quite dissimilar and thus, relatively 
easy to classify (Rustia et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2020c).

Helpful Answer:
The study does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it emphasizes the importance of proper validation procedures to avoid overestimating model performance due to weak validation methods like random data splitting. The authors also highlight the need for more granular insect classifications beyond broad categories like insect orders or families, which may lead to easier but less accurate classifications.

To improve the robustness of their models, they use a combination of data splitting and image tiling techniques. They separate the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets, ensuring that each subset contains representative samples from all classes. This approach helps prevent any potential biases introduced by uneven distribution of classes across different subsets. Additionally, they employ image tiling to divide large images into smaller tiles containing multiple bounding boxes, allowing them to process larger images without losing important features. By combining these techniques, they aim to create a more balanced and comprehensive dataset, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of their deep learning models.
