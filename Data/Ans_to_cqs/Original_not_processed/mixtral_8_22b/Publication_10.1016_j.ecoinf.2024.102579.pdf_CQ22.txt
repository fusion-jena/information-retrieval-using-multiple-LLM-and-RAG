green – NN4 estimator (Eq. 11). The upper index in round brackets indicates the number of nearest neighbours, k, used to estimate the corresponding diversity index.

(Pommerening, 2023), as structural complexity is an important objec-
tive  of  this  type  of  forest  management.  Compared  to  variance,  the 
contribution of bias to the values of rRMSE is rather small. This is where 
the  NN3  and  NN4  estimators  can  help,  since  they  are  effective  in 
reducing the overall index variation. They have performed well with all 
diversity indices other than distance and the aggregation index. In this 
context, it is particularly interesting that the NN4 estimator, which is 
based  on  the  weights  of  both  sample  trees  and  of  the  neighbours  of 
sample trees, has performed best with most diversity indices other than 
distance  and  aggregation  index.  Given  the  general  aim  to  reduce  the 
index variance, this finding seems to suggest that the information pro-
vided by sample-tree neighbours complements that of the sample trees 
and is with most indices more important than spatial edge-bias concerns

NN1  and  NN2  estimators  (Pommerening  and  Stoyan,  2006)  are 
generally associated with a low bias, although they were not originally 
designed for relascope sampling. Our results suggest that they can be 
considered safe options, since they are edge-correction methods that are 
more firmly based on statistical theory. Therefore, for indices directly 
related to distances, according to our results the NN2 estimator should 
be used. Unfortunately both NN1 and NN2 estimators have the disad-
vantage  that  they  exclude  the  diversity  index  values  of  some  sample 
trees. Since the number of sample trees per sample point if often small, 
such  exclusions  increase  the  index  variance  and  thus  the  rRMSE  in 
relascope-based  forest  inventories.  Our  simulation  results  highlighted 
that  the  variance  between  sample  plots  constitutes  the  largest  contri-
bution to sampling errors. This variance is likely to increase in forests

In Eq. (7), n is the number of trees included in the sample at a given 
sample point, i.e. the number of sample trees. In the remainder of this 
paper, we referred to Eq. (7) as the inventory estimator.

%Query
Query: "What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model, but the provided context does not discuss any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Instead, the context focuses on various estimators used in forest inventories, such as the inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators. These estimators are used to calculate diversity indices in forest ecosystems. The discussion revolves around the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of these estimators when applied to different diversity indices.

Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query using the given context, as it does not contain any relevant information regarding the evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
