quirements are even larger when training with high-resolution images. 
BoTNet uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information and 
low-resolution  feature  maps  before  inputting  them  for  self-attention, 
thereby  avoiding  excessive  memory  and  computational  resource  con-
sumption. Fig. 3 shows the structure of the BoTNet.

EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

2.1.2. Training data preparation

A  bottleneck  transformer  is  a  simple  but  powerful  transformer 
structure. Self-attention models in the field of vision can be classified 
into  Pure  Attention  Models  and  Convolution  Attention  Models.  The 
advantage of convolution-based models is their parameter sharing and 
efficient local information aggregation capabilities. To integrate global 
information, convolution-based models require the stacking of multiple 
convolutional layers. Self-attention, on the other hand, has the ability to 
obtain  global  information.  Therefore,  combining  self-attention  and 
convolution  can  reduce  the  network  depth  and  improve  the  model’s 
performance. BoTNet replaces the 3 × 3 spatial convolutions in ResNet’s 
last  three  bottleneck  blocks  with  multi-head  self-attention  (MHSA) 
(Srinivas et al., 2021). The memory and computational requirements for 
self-attention  are  quadratic  in  the  spatial  dimension,  and  these  re-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
None of the given context mentions any specific strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline such as random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs. These methods help control the randomness introduced by various components in the pipeline, including weight initialization, batch selection, and data augmentation. But without explicit mention in the provided text, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
