Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python libraryâ€™s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

A = N_estimators 
B = Learning_rate 
C = Max_depth 
D = Colsample_bytree 
E = Min_child_weight 
F = Sub_sample 
G = Random_state 
H = Min_samples_split 
I = Min_samples_leaf 
J = Max_features 
K = min_impurity_decrease 
L = min_weight_fraction_leaf 
M = loss 
N = bootstrap 
O = bootstrap_features 
P = max_samples 
Q = max_leaf_nodes 
R = l2_regularization 
S = max_bins 
T = min_child_samples 
U = reg_lambda 
V = reg_alpha 
W = num_leaves

3.2.2.8. LGBM  hyperparameter  tweaking. Table  2  shows  the  LGBM 
model  hyperparameters  selected  for  nitrate  and  DO  prediction  to 
maximize  performance.  Subsamples  reduce  overfitting  and  min_-
child_samples  control local pattern  sensitivity. Overfitting is  prevented 
via reg_lambda. As mentioned, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and 
random_state were used. 

3.2.2.9. GB  model  hyperparameter  tuning. As  seen  in  Table  2,  the 
hyperparameter values for the nitrate and DO model are reported below. 
As described in the preceding sections, each of these parameters is uti-
lized. These hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance 
the nitrate and DO model performances.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process based solely on this context.
