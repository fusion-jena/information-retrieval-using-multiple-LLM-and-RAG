followed  the  original  Wide  ResNet  design.  Our  downsampling  blocks 
employed the changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). The third and final 
component, the classification block, was derived from (Schlüter, 2018) 
and resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second (i. 
e., three predictions per 3-s input spectrogram) followed by global log- 
mean-exponential  pooling  and  sigmoid  activation.  Most  convolutions 
use 3 × 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normali-
zation  (Ioffe  and  Szegedy,  2015)  and  ReLU  activation  (if  not  noted 
differently).  Because  we  treated  spectrograms  as  monochrome  input 
images, the input was a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, 
visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. 

2.5. Training

overall process mostly followed current best practices in deep learning 
which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017).

Here  we  present  a  new  algorithm,  called  BirdNET,  that  builds  on 
these previous successes using CNNs and spectrogram data to classify 
984  bird  species.  We  discuss  the  necessary  steps  required  to  develop 
such a system and provide insights into our training and testing work-
flow of a deep artificial neural network. Finally, we give an outlook on 
how  this  technology  can  support  ornithologists  and  conservation  bi-
ologists in their work to identify and address the environmental chal-
lenges of our time.

diversify  the  training  data,  and  the  3-s  window  length  enables  the 
implementation of this data augmentation method.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the model uses spectrogram data to classify 984 bird species. This suggests that the authors have created their own custom dataset containing spectrogram images of bird sounds. Additionally, they use a 3-second window length for implementing data augmentation methods, which further indicates that they are working with temporal sound data rather than traditional image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
