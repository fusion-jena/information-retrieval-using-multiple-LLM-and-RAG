A very important component of machine learning is model selection
(also known as feature selection) and is mandatory in order to reach the
best model from other alternative ones. Arthur et al. (2010); Li and
Heap (2011) suggest that model selection is important for the popular
random forest algorithm and thus, researchers have to focus to the most
important variables.

3.2.5. K-nearest neighbors

It is an non-parametric ‘lazy’ learning algorithm. This means that it
does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and
that it does not use the training data points to do any generalization. It
does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply
stores instances of the training data. Classiﬁcation is computed from a
simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query
point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives
within the nearest neighbors of the point.

3.2.6. Decision tree

The Decision Tree Classiﬁer is a simple and widely used classiﬁca-
tion technique. It applies a straightforward idea to solve the classiﬁ-
cation problem by posing a series of carefully crafted questions about
the attributes of the test record. Each time it receives an answer, a
follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the class label of
the record is reached.

By determining which variables are most important we can simplify
the analysis of a dataset, better understand the physical concepts of it,
and exclude the ones that confuse the model achieving better accuracy
and learning/testing speed.

There exist several ways to determine variable importance, e.g.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Chi-square, and Regression. We deal
with tree-based variable importance, like (Arthur et al., 2010) did. It

3.2. Machine learning algorithms

There exist many supervised machine learning algorithms in lit-
erature, distinguished into several categories, such as Generalized
Linear Models (GLM), Decision Trees (DT), Instance Based (IB), Support

One of the most popular machine learning methods for classiﬁcation
of linear problems are Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Cherkassky,
1997) with a linear kernel. They try to ﬁnd a set of hyperplanes that

separate the space into areas representing classes. These hyperplanes
are chosen in a way which maximizes the distance from the nearest data
point of each class. The Linear SVC is the simplest and fastest SVM
algorithm assuming a linear separation between classes.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of using a deep learning model or its specific purpose. However, the text discusses various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Therefore, one could infer that if a deep learning model were employed, its purpose might also be related to classification tasks. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the implementation of a deep learning model, this remains speculative.

Answer:::

Given the provided context, there is no direct reference to a deep learning model or its intended purpose. However, based on the discussed machine learning algorithms, it can be assumed that if a deep learning model were utilized, it would likely serve a similar function, such as classification. Nonetheless, without more specific information concerning the application of a deep learning model, this assumption remains hypothetical.
