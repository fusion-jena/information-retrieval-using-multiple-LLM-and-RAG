caught  individuals.  Several  simple  and  effective  traps  exist,  such  as 
malaise traps, sticky traps, and pitfall traps. However, identifying and 
counting  the  trapped  specimens  is  labor-intensive  and  requires  taxo-
nomic expertise,  thus  limiting the  scale  of monitoring. Several  recent 
stud/ ies harnessed the power of deep-learning (DL) based image pro-
cessing  to  alleviate  the  burden  on  app/  b/lied  entomologists  who 
monitor  specific  forestry,  agricultural  and  medical  pests  (For  recent 
reviews, see Schneider et al., 2023, Teixeira et al., 2023). Such efforts 
comprise four steps: (a) collection of insect images; (b) labeling of in-
dividual insects by experts, to generate two or more classes (e.g., ‘pest’, 
‘natural  enemy’,  and  ‘other’);  (c)  building  a  statistical  model  of  the 
classes (training in the machine learning jargon); and (d) applying the 
model to new instances, such as field caught insects (inference). These

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the pipeline uses a ResNet152 model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be seen from the description of the STARdbi\_train module, where it states that the output is a binary pickle file containing a ResNet152 model. Therefore, we can conclude that the pipeline employs a CNN architecture, specifically the ResNet152 variant.
