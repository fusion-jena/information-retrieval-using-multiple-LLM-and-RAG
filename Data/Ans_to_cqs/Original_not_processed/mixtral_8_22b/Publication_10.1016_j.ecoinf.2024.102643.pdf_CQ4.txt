differed  between  the  Euro-Siberian  and  Irano-Turanian  regions,  as 
damages to livestock and beehives and road accidents were significantly 
higher in the Euro-Siberian region (Table 1).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not contain any details about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of training examples available for a machine learning model, without actually collecting new data. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. However, based on the given context, it cannot be determined which specific techniques have been applied in this case.
