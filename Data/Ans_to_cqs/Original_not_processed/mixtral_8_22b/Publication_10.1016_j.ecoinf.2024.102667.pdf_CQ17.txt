2.2.3. Other data 

The land use/cover dataset for China featured a spatial resolution of 
1 km × 1 km and was acquired from RESDC. The dataset encompasses 
land use/cover information spanning the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. It covers six major land use/cover cate-
gories and twenty-six subcategories. Through a combination of manual 
and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, the primary 
land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the 
secondary  land  use/cover  categories  had  an  accuracy  exceeding  90% 
(Ning et al., 2018). In our research, the reclassified land use/cover types 
were categorized into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, 
construction land, water area, and unused land. The boundary datasets 
for  ecological  engineering  are  sourced  from  the  National  Ecological 
Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are techniques employed during model training to avoid overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or randomly dropping out neurons. However, since this topic is not covered within the provided context, I cannot provide specific details regarding the usage of these methods in this case.
