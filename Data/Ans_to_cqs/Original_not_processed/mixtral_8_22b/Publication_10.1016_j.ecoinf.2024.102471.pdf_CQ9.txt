Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Wav2vec is one of the latest state-of-art models for Automatic Speech 
Recognition  and  other  audio-related  problems  (Boigne  et  al.,  2020) 
(Shibano et al., 2021). The architecture of the Wav2vec is based on the 
transformer's  encoder,  with  a  training  objective  like  BERT's  masked 
language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The 
self-supervised  way  of  training  allows  Wav2vec  to  pre-train  on  unla-
belled data, which is more accessible (Hendrycks et al., 2019). Later, the 
model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. 
This  approach  shows  remarkable  improvement  in  the  model's  perfor-
mance, especially if the dataset size is very small with label.

As machine learning continues to advance, the process of identifying 
bird species can be automated by transferring the knowledge of experts 
in this field to a learning model. A recent study has shown that deep 
learning is an effective method for classifying birds based on their calls, 
such as processing large amounts of audio data, which allows it to detect 
subtle  differences  between  bird's  calls  (Michaud  et  al.,  2023).  Addi-
tionally, deep learning models can be trained on a wide variety of audio 
data,  allowing  them  to  identify  even  rare  ecological  moment  of  bird 
species (Akbal et al., 2022). Transfer learning is an important tool in 
machine learning, allowing models to leverage the knowledge learned 
from  one  domain  and  apply  it  to  another.  Transfer  learning  is  very 
helpful when there is insufficient data to fully train a model, such as 
recognizing  uncommon  bird  species  (Huang  and  Basanta,  2021).

67%. R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) described identifying bird 
species  based  on  their  vocalization  or  call  by  the  spike-based  neural 
networks.  The  dataset  contains  the  vocalizations  of  14  different  bird 
species,  recorded  by  the  Central  Poultry  Development  Organization 
(CPDO)  in  Bhubaneswar,  India,  using  a  digital  recorder  and  a  unidi-
rectional microphone.

and  MFCC  features.  Using  a  small  dataset,  K.  W.  Gunawan  et  al. 
(Gunawan  et  al.,  2021)  used  a  transfer  learning  technique  to  avoid 
overfitting when categorizing endangered species, such as the Indone-
sian  scops  owl.  They  suggested  a  dual-input  scalable  convolutional 
neural  network  based  on  EfficientNet  that  uses  Mel  spectrogram  and 
MFCC. A pre-trained experimental dual-input network achieves 99.27% 
mAP. However, the model was not extended to include other variations 
of bird species.

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repositories of the deep learning pipelines are available. However, some studies have mentioned using datasets from specific organizations. For instance, R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) used a dataset containing the vocalizations of 14 different bird species, recorded by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India. Unfortunately, no further details about the availability of this dataset were given. Similarly, K. W. Gunawan et al. (Gunawan et al., 2021) used a transfer learning technique to categorize endangered species, including the Indonesian scops owl, but did not provide any information regarding the source or accessibility of their dataset. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot determine where the data repositories of these deep learning pipelines are available.
