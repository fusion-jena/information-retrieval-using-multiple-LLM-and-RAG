exponential, identity, logistic, and hyperbolic tangent. The training al-
gorithms used were resilient propagation (Rprop) and scaled conjugate 
gradient (SCG). The initial ANN weights were randomly generated, and 
the maximum number of iterations was 100 due to the error becoming 
constant before this number. The ANNs were implemented with the MLP 
function of the “RSNNS” Package in R (Bergmeir and Benítez, 2012). The 
svm function of the “e1071” Package on R was used for training SVMs. 
Thus, four configurations were used in the SVR training, represented by 
four kernel functions: Linear, Polynomial, Radial basis and Sigmoid.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired 
by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The neural network 
is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combi-
nations of the input values from the preceding layer. Then, a non-linear 
activation function is applied. The trainable parameters of the network 
are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by 
each  individual  neuron  (Domingues  et  al.,  2020;  Kantarcioglu  et  al., 
2023). 

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines 
multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a 
random  subset  of  the  data,  and  the  final  prediction  is  determined  by 
aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust 
results  even  when  the  number  of  observations  is  smaller  than  the 
number  of  variables  or  the  variables  are  correlated  (Breiman,  2001; 
Nguyen et al., 2019).

The trained ANN was the multilayer perceptron, also known as the 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), with a hidden layer. The range of neurons 
in  this  layer  was  defined  by  the  Fletcher-Gloss  method  (Silva  et  al., 
2010): 2 × n0.5 + n2 ≤ n1 ≤ 2 × n + 1; in which: n = number of network 
inputs; n1 = amount of neurons in the hidden layer; and n2 = number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer.  The  activation  functions  tested  were

Next, three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: 
the number of random regression trees (ntree, tested 20 to 100 trees); 
the number of division variables (mtry, used to determine the number of 
variables available to each node of the tree, with the default number of 
1/3 of the independent variables); and the minimum size of nodes (node 
size, value = 5).

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, two optimization techniques are mentioned for training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Resilient Propagation (Rprop) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG). These methods are not explicitly stated as being part of a deep learning pipeline but can be considered optimization techniques within machine learning algorithms.

Resilient Propagation (Rprop) is a first-order optimization algorithm designed specifically for supervised learning in feedforward neural networks. It updates the weights based on local gradient information, making it efficient and adaptive to different problems.

Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) is another optimization technique used for training ANNs. SCG belongs to the family of second-order optimization methods, which use both the gradient and Hessian matrix of the loss function to find the optimal solution. This approach often leads to faster convergence compared to first-order methods like Rprop.

Although not directly mentioned in the context, other popular optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). SGD is a simple yet effective optimization algorithm widely used for training various types of neural networks. On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of both AdaGrad and RMSProp, providing an efficient and adaptive learning rate for each parameter during training.
