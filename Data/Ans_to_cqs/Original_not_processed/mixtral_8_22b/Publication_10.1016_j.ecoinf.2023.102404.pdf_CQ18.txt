parameters of our machine learning model. Specifically, we focused on 
tuning  several  critical  parameters,  namely  ‘numberOfTrees’,  ‘min-
LeafPopulation’, ‘bagFraction’, and ‘seed’. The ‘numberOfTrees’ repre-
sents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, and through the grid 
search, we explored different values to determine the ideal number of 
trees  that  balances  model  complexity  and  predictive  performance. 
Similarly, ‘minLeafPopulation’  refers to the minimum number of sam-
ples required to form a leaf node in each tree. We experimented with 
various values to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while 
capturing meaningful patterns in the data. The ‘bagFraction’  indicates 
the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, 
and  we  searched  for  the  best  value  to  enhance  model  diversity  and 
generalization. Lastly, ‘seed’  is a random number seed used to ensure

In  our  study,  we  adopted  a  grid  search  approach  to  optimize  the

reproducibility, and we evaluated multiple seeds to select the one that 
provides  the  most  stable  and  reliable  results.  To  carry  out  the  grid 
search, we defined a range of potential values for each parameter based 
on  prior  knowledge  and  literature  review.  The  grid  search  then 
exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and eval-
uated the model’s  performance using cross-validation techniques. For 
each  combination,  we  utilized  the  RMSE  as  the  evaluation  metric, 
aiming to minimize the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. 
By employing the grid search method, we aimed to optimize the model’s 
hyperparameters and enhance its ability to generalize well to new, un-
seen data, making it a robust and effective tool for our regression task. 
The  winning  parameters  are  as  follows:  numberOfTrees:  150,  min-
LeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123.

randomly  selected  half  of  the  pixels  for  the  training  and  testing  split 
(Hudak et al., 2020). This strategic sampling technique was chosen to 
capture  the  full  distribution  of  AGB  values  within  the  LiDAR-derived 
AGB  maps  accurately.  This  stratified  random  sampling  approach  was 
chosen to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented 
the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. The 
use of this approach was crucial in ensuring that the AGB maps gener-
ated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values 
in the study area.

Helpful Answer:

To monitor the model performance during training, the researchers employed a grid search approach combined with cross-validation techniques. They defined a range of potential values for each hyperparameter ('numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed') based on prior knowledge and literature review. The grid search exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and evaluated the model's performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. By minimizing the RMSE, they aimed to achieve the most accurate predictions and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. The winning parameters obtained from this process were: numberOfTrees: 150, minLeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123. Additionally, the researchers used a stratified random sampling approach to capture the full distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. This ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps, leading to more accurate and representative AGB maps for the study area.
