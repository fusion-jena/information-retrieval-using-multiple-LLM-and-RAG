2.2. Data and processing 

Detailed information of the data in this study can be obtained from 
Table 1. The Google Earth Engine platform, as a planetary-level cloud 
computing platform, provides rich remote sensing data (Gorelick et al., 
2017). This study selected the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI 
dataset(MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of 
AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset(CDR AVHRR NDVI)(Eric et al., 2024), and the 
third  generation  GIMMS  NDVI  from  AVHRR  sensors  dataset  (GIMMS 
NDVI) on the Google Earth Engine platform. The SPOT/VEGETATION 
products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are 
sourced  from  the  Resource  and  Environmental  Data  Center  of  the

cloud  cover,  and  surface  information  across  NDVI  product  datasets 
result  in  distinct  strengths  and  weaknesses  for  each  product.  Conse-
quently, researchers must carefully select NDVI products to ensure data 
suitability for their specific research needs (Fensholt et al., 2009).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the application of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based on the available information. Please provide more relevant context if possible.
