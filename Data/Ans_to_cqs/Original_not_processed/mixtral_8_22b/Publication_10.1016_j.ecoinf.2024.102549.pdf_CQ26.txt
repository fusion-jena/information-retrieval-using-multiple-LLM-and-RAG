of CNN architectures, and adjust network layers and hyperparameters to 
predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. More-
over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples from each class.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing instances or creating synthetic ones. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing them or selecting only those that are most informative. Both methods aim to balance the class distribution in the dataset.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that it represents all possible scenarios. This helps prevent biases caused by limited or unrepresentative datasets.

Without more specific information regarding the context, it cannot be determined which technique was used in this case.
