Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python libraryâ€™s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

Hyperparameter  tuning  plays  a  crucial role  in  optimizing  the  per-
formance of a model by improving its ability to predict observed and 
predicted ranges. The tuning process maximizes the models training and 
testing  performance.  It  will  control  overfitting  or  underfitting  issues 
(Elshawi et al., 2019). Though the process is complex and takes a long 
time,  many  optimizing  methods,  such  as  Manual  Tuning,  Bayesian 
Optimization,  and  random  grid  search  methods,  simplify  the  process 
(Yang  and  Shami,  2020).  Nevertheless,  choosing  which  optimizing 
method is best for specific data is challenging. Hyperparameter tuning of 
the decision tree model are usually configured with maximum depth and 
minimum number of samples required to split a node. For the RF model, 
extensive  experimentation  was  conducted  using  varying  numbers  of 
trees  for  the  optimal  fit.  The  gradient  boosting  model  is  tuned  with

maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate (Bolick et al., 
2023). These refined hyperparameters are selected to enhance the ac-
curacy and predictive capabilities of the models, rendering them suit-
able for effective utilization in academic research and publications.

Helpful Answer: After the model training phase, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the type of machine learning task and the desired outcome. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics helps assess the performance of the trained model. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, confusion matrix, etc. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: To ensure robustness and generalizability of the model, k-fold cross-validation is often employed. This involves splitting the dataset into 'k' subsets, where each subset serves as the validation set once while the remaining 'k-1' subsets form the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, and the average performance metric is reported. In this case, fivefold cross-validation has been mentioned.

3. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model can significantly improve its performance. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization techniques can be applied to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. In this context, we see that different hyperparameters have been explored for various models, including n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, learning_rate, etc.

4. Feature importance: Extracting feature importances from the trained model provides valuable information about which features contribute most to the predictions. Techniques such as SHAP values, LIME, or simple feature ranking based on coefficients can be utilized for this purpose.

5. Visualizations: Creating visual representations of the results, such as scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, or saliency maps, can help understand the patterns and relationships within the data better. Additionally, these visualizations aid in communicating the findings effectively to stakeholders.

6. Model interpretation: Interpreting the trained model's behavior and understanding why it makes certain decisions is essential for building trust and ensuring fairness. Various techniques, such as partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation (ICE) curves, or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), can be employed for interpreting black-box models.
