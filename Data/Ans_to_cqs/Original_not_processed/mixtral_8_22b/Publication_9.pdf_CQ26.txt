Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the importance of having relevant input data when using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), like those trained on ImageNet. It also mentions the need for diverse data collection to improve the accuracy and scalability of image pre-processing in biology.

To address data bias, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes. Collecting diverse data ensures that the dataset represents various scenarios and conditions, reducing potential biases. These methods help mitigate data imbalance and ensure fair representation of all classes, improving the overall performance of the deep learning models.
