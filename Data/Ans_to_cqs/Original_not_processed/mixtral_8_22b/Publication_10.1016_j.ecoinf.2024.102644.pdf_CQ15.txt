Big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models can help forecast biodiversity changes before 
they happen. These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform 
preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and 
mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particu-
larly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the 
past  century,  with  profound  consequences  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services.  Through  big-data  mining 
approaches,  we  can  predict  future  wetland  biodiversity  trends  in  the  context  of  climate  change.  This  paper 
proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This
