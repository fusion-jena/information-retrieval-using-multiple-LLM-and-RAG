In addition, it is important to note that the fusion of MODIS data and
Sentinel-2 data has a large spatial-resolution span. Furthermore,
downsampling of MODIS NDVI time-series data introduces certain er-
rors (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, it is necessary to clarify that the input
data for SOWCEM prediction currently consist of optical remote sensing
data. It is important to consider that optical images are influenced by
their imaging conditions, which can lead to reduced accuracy in
reconstructing areas with persistently high cloud cover over a long
period of time. This poses a challenge for ensuring sufficient authen-
ticity. To address this issue, it is recommended to incorporate hetero-
geneous data from multimodal signals at the source and jointly optimize
and combine multiple features.

5.3. Limitations and prospects

The study used MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06,
spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data were ob-
tained from the Google Earth Engine platform and subjected to pre-
processing steps including mosaicking and clipping. The data access link
