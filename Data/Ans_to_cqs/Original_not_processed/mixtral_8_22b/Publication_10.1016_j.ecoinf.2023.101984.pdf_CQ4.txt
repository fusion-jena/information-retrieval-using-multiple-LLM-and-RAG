bio9,  ‘Mean  temperature  of  driest  quarter’,  is  a  quarterly  index  that 
approximates  the  mean  temperatures  that  occur  during  the  driest 
quarter (degrees Celsius); 4) bio13, ‘Precipitation of wettest month’, is 
the index that identifies the total precipitation that occurs during the 
wettest month (millimetres); 5) bio19, ‘Precipitation of coldest quarter’, 
is  a  quarterly  index  that  indicates  the  total  precipitation  that  occurs 
during the coldest quarter (millimetres); and 6) ‘Slope’ in % values of the

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques for image classification tasks include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset and improve the generalization performance of the model by introducing variations into the input images.

Unhelpful Answer:
The given context mentions the use of maximum iterations with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage in the MaxEnt model. It also lists various Mediterranean climate types, layers, sectors, and references. However, it does not provide any information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
