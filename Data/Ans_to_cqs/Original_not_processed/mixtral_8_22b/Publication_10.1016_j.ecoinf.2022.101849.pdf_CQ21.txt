Table 1 
An example training instance for different weakly-labeled settings. Here yj indicates the targets of an instance. Red indicates an 
error in the training data (deviation from ground truth) – it is not known to the user where errors occur. Note that in the weak 
j=1yj = 1 and yj⩾0). In our setting 
label setting, only 0s may be errors. Shading represents a constraint (in this example, that 
(structurally incomplete), the constraint may not be met, but errors are neither random deviations. Mixtures of these settings 
are possible, e.g., we may have structurally incomplete with missing labels, etc.

Various other terms have been used to describe weakly supervised 
learning tasks in the literature (Table 1). Weak labels (Sun et al., 2010) 
or  partial labels (Xie  and  Huang, 2018)  are  mainly  considered  in  the 
context  of  binary  labels.  They  often  include  different  types  of  noise 
coming from the labeling process and data sources and lacks constraints. 
Distribution learning (Gao et al., 2017) entails the constraint that the 
outputs  must  sum  to  unity,  but  this  constraint  is  already  met  in  the 
training data, unlike in our structural incompleteness setting.

4.2. Performance of predictive models 

The performance of compared predictive models is summarized in 
Tables 2–4. When using only complete targets for training, the MAE of 
complete  observations  of  the  test  set  is  the  lowest.  However,  experi-
mental  results  on  evaluating  the  prediction  accuracy  of  dominant 
vegetation  cover  types  show  that  using  this  approach,  the  prediction 
accuracy of incomplete observations is more than 10% less than using 
other approaches. This suggests that complete observations do not carry 
full information about the distribution of the natural vegetation cover 
worldwide.  It  confirms  existing  findings  (Nikoloski  et  al.,  2021)  that 
better performance can be achieved if incompletely labeled data is used 
in model training instead of discarding it.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, the model needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, confusion matrices, etc. These metrics help determine how well the model has learned to classify or predict the target variable.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Once the initial model has been trained and evaluated, hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization parameters, batch size, number of layers, etc., can be fine-tuned to improve the model's performance further. Techniques like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., can be employed for hyperparameter tuning.

3. Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding which features contribute most significantly to the predictions made by the model can provide valuable insights into the underlying patterns in the data. Methods like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, LIME, etc., can be used to analyze feature importance.

4. Visualizations: Creating visual representations of the model's output can aid in understanding the model's behavior better. Examples include saliency maps, activation heatmaps, t-SNE plots, PCA plots, etc. These visualizations can reveal interesting patterns and relationships within the data.

5. Ensemble Models: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can lead to improved performance over individual models. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be applied to build ensembles.

6. Deployment: Finally, once the model has been thoroughly tested and validated, it can be deployed in production environments to generate real-time predictions or perform automated decision making.
