(sowing), green (emergence and full growth) and bare soil (harvest).
Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

5.2. Deep learning with Ppf-CM

5.3. Invasion outbreak of S. alterniﬂora

This is the ﬁrst time that the invasion outbreak of the S. alterniﬂora
was discovered at the regional scale, which beneﬁtted from the fol-
lowing three factors: (1) The proposed Ppf-CM eases the problems
caused by the scarcity of entire scene cloud-free Landsat scenes; (2) The
deep learning classiﬁer optimizes the use of the phenological
in-
formation yielded from Ppf-CM; (3) GEE provides an ideal platform for
handling massive amount of data required by the pixel-based method
(i.e. Ppf-CM) with its powerful data storage and high computational
capacity.

achieved with Ppf-CM based SAE method, suggesting SAE beneﬁted
more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages
using Ppf-CM (Table 4). This was mainly because, compared to the
traditional machine learning method (SVM), deep learning method
(SAE) can easily capture and exploit more complex information with its
deep network structure and strong self-learning ability (Penatti et al.,
2015; Xie et al., 2015).

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide explicit details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of a deep learning classifier that optimizes the use of phenological information yielded from Ppf-CM. Additionally, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used as a platform for handling large amounts of data, which could potentially contribute to the robustness and generalizability of the model. Nevertheless, without clear mention of techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, one cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
