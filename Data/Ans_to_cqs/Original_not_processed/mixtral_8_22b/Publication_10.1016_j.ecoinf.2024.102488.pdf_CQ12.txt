4.1. Evaluation of fusion quality 

(1)  The  feature  dataset,  training  samples,  and  validation  samples 
were used as input into five base models to generate prediction 
results  (TKNN,  TRF,  TAdaBoost,  TXGBoost,  TLightGBM)  of  the  training 
samples  and  prediction  results  (VKNN,  VRF,  VAdaBoost,  VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM) of the validation samples.  

(2)  TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM  were combined in a 
column manner to obtain T, and VKNN, VRF, VAdaBoost, VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM were combined in a column manner to obtain V.  
(3)  Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the 
RF  algorithm  was  used  to  generate  the  prediction  results 
(α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of  training  data  T  by  5-fold  cross-validation. 
Stack (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) in rows to get A.

) is  obtained  by  predicting  V.  Additionally,  the 

classification result B was obtained by voting.

(2)  The features with the lowest importance scores are removed from 
the  current  feature  combinations,  and  the  process  of  feature 
pruning  is  repeated  recursively  until  the  cross-validation  accu-
racy reaches the highest level. In the RFECV process, a five-fold 
cross-validation  was  used  to  select  the  number  and  combina-
tions of features.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses the application of various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for generating predictions and classifications. These methods do not belong to the category of deep learning models but rather fall under traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
