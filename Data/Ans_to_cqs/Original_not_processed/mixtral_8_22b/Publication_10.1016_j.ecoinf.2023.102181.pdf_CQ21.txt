Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model.

training  (i.e.,  bagging),  then  to  obtain  unbiased  estimates  of  model 
performance  without  omitting  portions  of  the  feature  space  during 
validation. An important note is that the latter procedure also enables 
leveraging of spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction. 
Bagging normally proceeds by drawing many bootstrap samples of 
the data and training models on each, which are aggregated to form an 
ensemble predictor (Breiman, 1996). Individual data points each have 
probability P(si) = 1
n  of being selected during a single draw of a single 
bootstrap sample, where si  is one of n data points distributed over the 
study  area.  Non-independent  data  observations  can  be  considered  as 
partial replication of some information in the modelling dataset. In an 
extreme example, consider two data points at the same location with 
exactly the same environmental measurements. We could conceptualize

weights  were  obtained  using  the  spatial  covariance  for  each  sample 
point (i.e., the row-wise sums) according to Section 2.3. The model was 
then  re-trained,  where  the  probability  of  drawing  a  given  data  point 
during each bagging bootstrap sample is proportional to the weight, and 
the residuals were re-calculated for the validation step (Section 2.5). To 
determine  whether  covariance-weighted  bagging  improved  the  true 
model performance for each simulation (Section 2.2), the models were 
used to predict the value of the response across the full extent of the 
study area,  ̂Zp(s), which was compared to the response raster surface, 
Z(s), to measure the true validation statistics VE and RMSE. The code for 
performing these simulations is provided in Supplementary Material S3.

approach  described  in  Section  2.4,  using  the  ‘automap’  and  ‘gstat’ 
packages (Gr¨aler et al., 2016; Hiemstra et al., 2009; Pebesma, 2004). 
The sequential simulation algorithm as implemented in ‘gstat’ was used 
to  simulate  500  Gaussian  random  fields,  conditioned  on  the  cross-

enable computation of many simulations, local kriging was used with a 
neighbourhood of 50 points, and random fields were predicted to a grid 
size of 1000 m, denoted s0. To calculate a range of accuracy metrics, the

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

2. Visualizing results: Techniques like saliency maps, activation maps, or GradCAM can be employed to visualize the regions of input images that contribute most significantly towards the final output decision made by the model. Such visualizations aid in interpreting the model's behavior and identifying any potential issues or biases.

3. Confusion matrices: Constructing confusion matrices provides insights into the types of errors made by the model. It helps identify patterns in misclassifications and allows for further analysis of class imbalance problems if present.

4. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models through techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking can improve overall performance and robustness. Postprocessing might involve applying ensemble methods to combine individual models and generate more accurate predictions.

5. Hyperparameter tuning: After initial training, hyperparameters can be fine-tuned based on the model's performance to achieve better results. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used strategies for finding optimal hyperparameters.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training typically focus on evaluating the model's performance, visualizing results, addressing class imbalances, combining models via ensemble methods, and optimizing hyperparameters.
