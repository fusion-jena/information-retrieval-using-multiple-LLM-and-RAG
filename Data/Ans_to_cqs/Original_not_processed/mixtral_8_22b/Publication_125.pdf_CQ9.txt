4.2.1. Data Augmentation

Abstract: Satellite images have drawn increasing interest from a wide variety of users, including
business and government, ever since their increased usage in important ﬁelds ranging from weather,
forestry and agriculture to surface changes and biodiversity monitoring. Recent updates in the ﬁeld
have also introduced various deep learning (DL) architectures to satellite imagery as a means of
extracting useful information. However, this new approach comes with its own issues, including
the fact that many users utilize ready-made cloud services (both public and private) in order to
take advantage of built-in DL algorithms and thus avoid the complexity of developing their own
DL architectures. However, this presents new challenges to protecting data against unauthorized
access, mining and usage of sensitive information extracted from that data. Therefore, new privacy
concerns regarding sensitive data in satellite images have arisen. This research proposes an efﬁcient

The motivation driving this speciﬁc research project is to link two cutting-edge re-
search topics, which are DL and privacy. Indeed, the progress of machine learning (ML)
and its subﬁeld of deep learning (DL) need not come at the expense of privacy or data
security. Therefore, this research work proposes a powerful approach based on PPDL
utilized on big satellite images in order to maintain anonymity and safeguard privacy
related to data. Our main contribution is to apply PPDL for satellite images’ data, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is an approach that has not been proposed or attempted
anywhere in the literature. In particular, the contributions of this study are:

except for the ﬁrst and last modules. The FC layer is replaced with a global average
POOL layer and the default input size is 299 × 299 × 3 [25].
DenseNet121: Huang et al. (2017) proposed the architecture of the DenseNet121 model,
another CNN-based architecture trained on the ImageNet dataset. DenseNet121 is
composed of 5 dense blocks. The ﬁrst block consists of a convolution layer with
a 7 × 7 ﬁlter and stride of 2 and a MaxPooling layer with a 3 × 3 max ﬁlter and
stride of 2. The remaining blocks consist of BatchNormalization, the ReLU activation
function, and two CONV layers with 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 ﬁlters. A transition layer follows
each block except for the last, which instead is followed by a classiﬁcation layer. In
DenseNet121, all previous feature-maps are used as input in each layer. The default
input size is 224 × 224 × 3 [26].

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide a specific answer to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given text does not mention any details about the data repository or where it might be located. It only discusses the use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), DenseNet121, and others for processing satellite images while maintaining privacy concerns related to data. To find out more about the data repository, additional context would be required.
