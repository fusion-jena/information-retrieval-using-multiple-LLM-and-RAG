similarities. It is widely used to visualize high-dimensional data (van der 
Maaten  and Hinton, 2008). Here the  method has been applied to the 
fc1000 activation vectors returned by ResNet-50. 

4.2. Classifier model 

The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing data-
sets.  For  model  selection  and  parameter  optimization  50%  of  the 
training data were held-out for validation (see Supporting Information). 
The final classification model, a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel, 
was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training 
dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to- 
posterior-probability transformation function (Platt, 2000), which pro-
vides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observa-
tions. Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during 
training.

voluminous  acoustic  datasets  (Wall  et  al.,  2021).  Efforts  to  automate 
the analysis of these data have included the development of various eco- 
acoustic metrics that attempt to summarize a soundscape using a small 
number  of  parameters,  often  intending  to  establish  a  proxy  for  more 
traditional  ecological  metrics  (e.g.,  Farina,  2019;  Gasc  et  al.,  2013; 
Pieretti  et  al.,  2011;  Towsey  et  al.,  2014),  unsupervised  machine

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the labeled dataset was split into 70/30 training and testing datasets. This approach allows the model to learn from a larger portion of the data while still having a separate set of data to evaluate its performance. Secondly, 50% of the training data were held out for validation. This process helps prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Lastly, a 10-fold cross-validation was employed to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. In this case, it provides a way to estimate the model's ability to predict new observations accurately. These steps collectively contribute to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model.
