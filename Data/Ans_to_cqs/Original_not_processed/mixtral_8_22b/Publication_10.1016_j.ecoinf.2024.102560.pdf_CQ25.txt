The river runoff variation given in Fig. 8(a) shows a decrease in the 
volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3  to 700 Mm3, which means 
that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth. 
Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which 
can generally be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are 
related  to  human  activities,  which  include  excessive  use  of  water  re-
sources, excessive development of agriculture around the lake, and the 
structures built in the basin. One of the human activities is changing the 
cultivation  pattern  and  creating  unconventional  deep  wells  in  the  re-
gion, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of 
water-based  agricultural  products  increased  from  350,000  ha  to 
500,000 ha. The construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the 
catchment  water  of  the  lake,  which,  with  these  unplanned  dams  and

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model was not explicitly stated. However, there are some clues that suggest what the model might have been used for. For instance, in the paper by Aksoy et al. (2022), they mention mapping soil salinity for the Urmia Lake basin using machine learning algorithms. This suggests that the deep learning model may have been used for image segmentation or classification to identify different levels of soil salinity based on satellite imagery. Additionally, in another paper by Safarian Zengir et al. (2020), they discuss monitoring and investigating the possibility of forecasting drought in the western part of Iran. While this does not directly relate to the use of a deep learning model, it could indicate that the model was being used for predictive purposes related to environmental changes. Without more specific information about the deep learning model mentioned in the context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its purpose.
