regularization makes it highly effective for complex predictive modeling
tasks (Hengl et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021c; Luo et al., 2024; Mehmood
et al., 2024a; Strandberg and Låås, 2019). SVR is a regression technique
that uses kernel functions to map input data into higher-dimensional
spaces where a hyperplane is fitted to minimize prediction error. This
method is particularly effective for capturing nonlinear relationships in
data. SVR balances model complexity and empirical risk, making it
suitable for a wide range of regression applications (Lee et al., 2020;
Mehmood et al., 2024a; Sharifi et al., 2016).

3. Results

3.1. Relationship between Landsat 9 OLI and SRTM DEM based
predictors and field-measured biomass

scenarios. The study showed the suitability of the SVR algorithm for
making predictions with restricted datasets, a finding that aligns with
previous research investigations (Kaveh et al., 2023; Mehmood et al.,
2024a; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). An important conclusion
is derived from Fig. 6. It highlights that MLR heavily depends on pre-
dictor variables, demonstrating a more pronounced reliance on these
elements than machine learning methods. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that relying solely on spectral bands to predict AGB is unlikely to
produce favorable outcomes. Integrating these spectral bands with other
variable sets, including those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-
derived indices, will lead to more favorable outcomes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions that Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR) use regularization techniques which make them highly effective for complex predictive modeling tasks. Regularization in SVR involves using a penalty term to balance model complexity and empirical risk, thus preventing overfitting. Specifically, SVR employs a C regularization parameter to control this tradeoff. Other regularization methods mentioned in the context include Ridge Regression (also known as L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (which combines both L1 and L2 regularizations). These methods add penalties to the loss function during training, encouraging simpler models and reducing the likelihood of overfitting.
