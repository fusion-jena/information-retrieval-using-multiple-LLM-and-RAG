The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer 
(cid:0) 5. The batch size 
(Kingma and Ba, 2015), with a weight decay of 1 × 10
was fixed at 16, and the loss function was updated as per Eq. (6). The 
learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by 
a  factor  of  0.1  in  a  step-wise  manner  whenever  the  validation  loss 
remained  constant  for  five  epochs.  The  minimum  learning  rate  was 
(cid:0) 5. The hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, 
established at 1 × 10
Mk  in Eq. (5) was defined as 2k+1(k = 1, 2, …K), and β in Eq. (6) was set 
to 0.4.

the  two  datasets  using  the  “stratified  sampling”  method.  We  selected 
birds of different class sizes from BirdCLEF2018, abbreviated as “BC-S" 
(BirdCLEF-Small)  and  “BC-L"  (BirdCLEF-Large).  From  the  Lishui- 
Zhejiang Birdsdata, we chose 100 bird species, referred to as “LS”. We 
then halved the number of training samples of each species for “LS” to 
construct  a  supplementary  small-scale  training  set,  denoted  as  “LS*”. 
The datasets were divided into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 
10% for validation, and 10% for testing to compare the experimental 
results. Detailed statistical information is presented in Table 3. 

4.2. Experimental results 

This section presents the experimental results of our PPNN model,

The  model’s  performance  was  assessed  using  the  mean  reciprocal 
rank  (MRR),  accuracy  (ACC),  and  hierarchical  distance  of  a  mistake 
(HDM) as metrics. The MRR (Go¨eau et al., 2018), an official evaluation 
metric of the BirdCLEF2018 competition, was employed to assess pro-
cesses that generate a list of potential responses to a sample of queries 
which are ranked by their likelihood of correctness. Accuracy was used 
to determine the proportion of correctly classified items, and an average 
accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC) was calculated to eval-
uate the efficacy of the hierarchical classification. The HDM (Bertinetto 
et al., 2020) was used to quantify the degree of misclassification when 
only  a  single  class  could  be  predicted.  For  example,  misclassifying 
Garrulax canorus as  Leiothrix lutea may not incur the same penalty as 
misclassifying Garrulax canorus as Caprimulgus jotaka. The mean height

their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, diverse datasets were utilized, including BirdCLEF2018 and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata. Within these datasets, birds of different class sizes were chosen, creating subsets like BC-S, BC-L, LS, and LS*. This diversity helped prevent overfitting and ensured the model could handle various types of data. Secondly, stratified sampling was applied during the selection process. This technique ensures that the distribution of classes within the training, validation, and test sets remains consistent, which helps maintain the balance between classes and prevents any one class from dominating the others. Lastly, the datasets were split into three distinct groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This division allowed for proper assessment of the model's performance and prevented any overlap between the training and testing data, ensuring unbiased evaluations.
