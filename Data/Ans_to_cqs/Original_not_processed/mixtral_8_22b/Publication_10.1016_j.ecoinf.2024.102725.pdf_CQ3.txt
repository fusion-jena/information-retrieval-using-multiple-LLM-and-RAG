The study used MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06,
spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data were ob-
tained from the Google Earth Engine platform and subjected to pre-
processing steps including mosaicking and clipping. The data access link

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that some form of data processing was performed on the MCD43A4 V6.1 data obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform. This included pre-processing steps like mosaicking and clipping. It should also be noted that the study aimed to integrate physical mechanisms and machine learning with multimodal data support in the spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, while the exact data annotation techniques used may not be explicitly stated, it can be assumed that appropriate methods were employed to prepare the data for analysis using deep learning algorithms.
