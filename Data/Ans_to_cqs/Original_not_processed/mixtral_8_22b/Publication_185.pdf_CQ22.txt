4.2.2 Data distribution  

In the machine learning literature, much research has focused on problems with imbalanced data 
(He  &  Garcia,  2009).  Previous  studies  have  noted  that  imbalanced  data  would  make  the 
significant negative impact on CNN models (J. N. Wang et al., 2017). To compare balanced data 
performance with imbalanced data, we used data resampling in training a new model. The new 
model covered six classes, where the classes are evenly distributed. Validation accuracy was only 
94% because the data size has decreased (Masko & Hensman, 2015). The recognition rate for the 
family Hesperiidae increased, and the other rates have changed at the same time (Table 3). 

We used images of six butterfly families to make our dataset because the image size and number 
are similar. The biological classification of these butterflies is recognized by taxonomists (M. Q. 
Zhou et al., 2006), so we can only use these known categories to make labels.

Image  classification  on  the  CNN  architecture  known  as  AlexNet  was  proposed  by  Alex 
Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012). There are eight layers in the network, containing five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers (Fig. 3). All feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise 
and learned from data, and the resulting feature maps were passed through rectified linear units 
(ReLUs),  a  type  of  non-linearity  unit.  The  model  was  trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent 
and  the  backpropagation  algorithm  included  in  Caffe  (Jia  et  al.,  2014),  with  the  learning  rate 
policy set to “step”. The learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially for the reason of accept the 
newly  defined  last  fully  connected  layer  set  to  10-2.  The  learning  rate  (lr)  was  decreased  by  a

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, the text does indicate that the models were evaluated based on their performance in the validation set. Specifically, it mentions that the validation accuracy was 94%. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to measure the effectiveness of the models. Additionally, the context discusses how the recognition rates for different butterfly families changed after implementing data resampling, implying that some form of class-wise performance measurement may also have been employed. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact metrics were utilized for evaluating the deep learning models.
