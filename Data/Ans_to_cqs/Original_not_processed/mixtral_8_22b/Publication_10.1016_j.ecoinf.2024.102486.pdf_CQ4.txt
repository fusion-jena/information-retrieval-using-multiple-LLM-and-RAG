Data augmentation methods are effective but are burdened with slow 
convergence  times  due  to  the  increased  dimension  of  the  space  they 
attempt to explore; Markov chains of this kind often have high posterior 
correlations in latent states and parameter values, leading to infeasible 
computation times to obtain effective sample sizes that are sufficient for 
robust  inference  (e.g.  King,  2011).  (Effective  sample  size,  ESS,  is  a 
measure  of  the  equivalent  number  of  independent  samples  from  the 
posterior  distribution  and  is  inversely  related  to  Monte  Carlo  error.) 
Because of this, more advanced Monte Carlo methods are required.

%Query
Query: "What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions that data augmentation methods can be effective but may suffer from slow convergence times due to the increased dimensionality of the explored space. The paper by Nanni, L., Maguolo, G., & Paci, M. (2020) discusses data augmentation approaches for improving analysis on many-core CPUs and GPUs, which could potentially include various techniques like those mentioned in the query. Additionally, the context refers to other tools and libraries commonly used in deep learning pipelines, including the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks and cuDNN, both of which might support data augmentation techniques.
