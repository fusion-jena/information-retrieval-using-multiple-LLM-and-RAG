Overall,  the  ML  bounding  box  model  was  92.2%  accurate  on  the 
given data, with 45.2% true positive classifications, 47.0% true nega-
tive, 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative. These outcomes are 
shown in the confusion matrix (Fig. 3). Several additional performance 
metrics  can  be  derived  from  the  observed  classification  outcomes, 
including  precision (the  number of  true positives  relative to true  and 
false positives) and recall (the number of true positives relative to true 
positives and false negatives). The performance was well-balanced be-
tween  precision  and  recall,  with  92.6%  and  91.5%,  respectively.  The 
classes  in  the  dataset  were  also  well-balanced,  with  49.6%  of  images 
containing at least one animal and 51.4% with no animals (empty).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include a validation loss plateau, where the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Other criteria may include reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs or achieving a target accuracy level.
