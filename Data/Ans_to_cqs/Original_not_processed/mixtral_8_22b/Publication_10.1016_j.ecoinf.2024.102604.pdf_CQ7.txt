on environmental covariates. Essentially, the sampling bias caused by 
the environment (variables) is presented by mapping the environmental 
space to the geographic space. Therefore, this study proposes that cor-
recting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial yet requires 
further testing (El-Gabbas and Dormann, 2018).

Random  Forests  (RF)  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019),  Boosted  Regression  Trees 
(BRT) (Hellegers et al., 2020) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) (Phillips

only presence data, has become a widely used SDM because of its su-
perior predictive ability (Wisz et al., 2008), particularly given the dif-
ficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into three parts: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters during training), and test set (used to assess the final performance of the trained model). The most commonly used ratios for splitting the data are 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10%. These percentages can vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem being addressed.
