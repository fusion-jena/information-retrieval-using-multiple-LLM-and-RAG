Other  ML  algorithms,  in  general,  and  deep  learning  algorithms,in 
particular,  can  be  applied  to  hyperspectral  data  to  predict  the  water 
quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital 
hyperspectral data. The number and spatial distribution of the samples, 
and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms (Vanhel-
lemont and Ruddick, 2021) are among essential parameters that should 
be noticed in  all future studies  to create  a representative dataset and 
make  a  ML-based  model  with  acceptable  generalisation  (Menezes  de

artificial neural networks (ANN) (Silveira Kupssinskü et al., 2020; Maier 
and Keller, 2019), and extreme machine learning (Peterson et al., 2018) 
became  popular  for  developing  semi-empirical  models.  They  provide 
intelligent  ways  of  eliminating  irrelevant  spectral  wavelengths  while 
unraveling  the  complex  relationship  between  response  and  predictor 
variables  with  limited  assumption  and  prior  knowledge  (Saberioon 
et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the topic of the research and the mentioned applications of other machine learning algorithms, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for prediction or estimation purposes. Specifically, it could be employed to predict water quality parameters using hyperspectral data from satellite imagery. This is supported by the mention of deep learning being used for estimating chlorophyll a concentrations in inland water bodies (Maier & Keller, 2021). Therefore, without explicit information about the specific task of the deep learning model, we can assume that its purpose is likely related to predicting or estimating water quality parameters based on hyperspectral data.
