3.10. Drought characteristics (severity, duration, and intensity) 

The regions  experiencing drought,  RED (measured in  percentage),

where  RED  represents  regions  experiencing  a  drought  with  time  t,  D 
represents drought (in the form of 0 or 1), R represents region, and g 
represents grid. Eq. 2 provides the percentage of regions experiencing 
drought, which determines the impact of drought in terms of its extent 
or  land  areas  affected  (in  percentage)  (e.g.,  Ndehedehe  et  al.,  2021; 
Wang et al., 2018). Drought severity, DS is evaluated for each drought 
event with t time, starting from ts and ending with te given in Eq. 3 (e.g., 
Diaz et al., 2019).

tions in the GAB. The findings from this study have direct implications 
for water resource management and policy. As droughts become more 
frequent  and  severe,  it  is  crucial  to  consider  adaptive  measures, 
including  efficient  water  allocation  and  the  development  of  drought- 
resistant crop varieties (Crossman, 2018). The results of this study also 
highlight  the  urgency  of  addressing  these  issues  at  both  regional  and 
global scales.

Our research findings have important implications for groundwater 
policy and management, particularly regarding the increasing frequency 
and severity of drought events in the GAB region. This information is 
crucial for policymakers and water resource managers. It highlights the 
need for drought preparedness strategies. Regional governments should 
prioritize  the  development  of  proactive  water  resource  management 
plans and strategies, which should be tailored to the specific needs and 
vulnerabilities of each sub-basin within the region. For example, in Surat 
and  Central  Eromanga  sub-basin  where  our  study  found  significant 
correlation  between  climatic  indices  and  GWS  variations,  strategies 
might focus on climate-resilient water resource management practices. 
In  Western  Eromanga  sub-basin,  characterized  by  prolonged  drought 
events, may require different strategies such as water extraction limits,

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately determine what strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training. However, some common methods include tracking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. during training epochs. Cross-validation techniques can also be employed to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. Regularization techniques might be applied to prevent overfitting. Learning curves could be plotted to visualize how the loss function changes with respect to the number of iterations. Early stopping criteria could be set based on validation loss to avoid unnecessary computational costs. These are all potential strategies but without further context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
