2.8. Optimizing model parameters

RF parameters include “ntree,” which controls the number of trees,
and “mtry,” which determines the number of variables sampled at each
split. Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid
search. Variable importance was assessed using “percent IncMSE” and
“IncNodePurity” indices (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst
et al., 2019). Key parameters for tuning XGBoost include “nrounds”
(boosting iterations), “max depth,” “min child weight,” “gamma,” and
“subsample.” A grid search methodology was employed to find the best

regression. In: 2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and
Automation (ICCCA). IEEE, pp. 1–4.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After completing the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation metrics: These are used to measure the performance of a trained model. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help determine how well the model is performing and whether it needs further adjustments.

2. Confusion matrix: This is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It provides information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

3. Cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or folds. Then, the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, such that each fold serves as the test set once. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: This step involves optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. Grid search and random search are commonly used methods for hyperparameter tuning.

5. Feature importance: This refers to the contribution of individual features towards the prediction made by the model. Techniques like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, and LIME can be used to calculate feature importance.

6. Visualizations: Various types of plots and charts can be created to better understand the data and the model's predictions. Examples include scatter plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and decision tree diagrams.

7. Model interpretation: This involves understanding how the model arrived at its predictions. Methods like partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) can be used for this purpose.
