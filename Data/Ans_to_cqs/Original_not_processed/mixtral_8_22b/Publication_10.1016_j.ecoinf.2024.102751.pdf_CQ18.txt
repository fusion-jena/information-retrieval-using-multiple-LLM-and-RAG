The developed predictive model was characterized by the following
values of model accuracy evaluation parameters: MAE – 4.1%; RMSE –
5.6%; R2–0.49. The value of Mean absolute error is (MAE) shows that
prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual VWC. RMSE 5.6% is slightly
higher than MAE because it squares the errors before averaging, giving
more weight to larger errors. It provides a similar interpretation to MAE
but emphasizes larger prediction errors. R2 value 0.49 shows that the
model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values. This
model indicates the moderate ability of the model to capture the relation
between the explanatory variable and VWC.

method was used to estimate the model parameters, recommended by
the authors of the mgcv library (Ingrosso et al., 2023). Automatic
elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory
variable was chosen. The parameter ‘select = T’ indicated that the
smoothing parameter estimation, part of model fitting, could completely
remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. Due to the
skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC a gamma distribution
with natural logarithm as the linking function was used for modeling.
The accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed
using the ‘yardstick’ package for R, specifically the ‘metrics’ function.
Three selected model parameters were calculated: RMSE (eq. 1), MAE
(eq. 2), and R2. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in pre-
dictions without considering their direction. RMSE is more sensitive to
outliers as it squares residuals. R2 represents the proportion of vari-

process.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the'metrics' function. Three selected model parameters are calculated to assess the accuracy of the developed model: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2. These metrics help evaluate the model's performance and its ability to accurately predict Volumetric Water Content (VWC). Additionally, the method used to estimate the model parameters includes automatic elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory variable, which can be seen through the'select = T' parameter. Furthermore, due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC, a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function is employed for modeling.
