IV. EXPERIMENTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

1) Biased Dataset: This dataset was created by randomly
taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for
testing. These are really approximate percentages because such
distribution has to be attempted for each species in dataset D.
How close to a 70%-30% distribution is achieved depends
on how many photos per species there are in dataset D. For
example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly
chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the
testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species
X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to
the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution. This
is the approach most of previous plant identiﬁcation studies
have followed (particularly those based on leaf-scans).

B. Deep Learning Experiment

The second experiment is similar to the ﬁrst one but it uses
deep learning CNNs to determine if the SSPB introduces a
signiﬁcant bias. It corresponds to the second row in Figure I.
There is no segmentation applied to the data, only a resize to
224x224 pixels before running the network on the data.

V. RESULTS

A. Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment

Table III shows the results related to the hand-crafted feature
extraction approach experiment. The accuracy obtained is
always considerably better when the biased dataset is used,
with a 26.4% difference when top-5 is used. This clearly shows
that SSPB introduces a signiﬁcant bias.

Helpful Answer:

In the context provided, there isn't explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the description of the experiments conducted that they involve using images or photographs of plants.

For instance, in the 'Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment', a dataset named 'D' is mentioned, which could potentially refer to a collection of plant images. Similarly, in the 'Deep Learning Experiment', the process involves resizing images to 224x224 pixels before feeding them into the network.

While these details do not directly mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets, they suggest that the raw data collected for this particular study might have been image data, possibly sourced from existing databases or captured specifically for this research.

To provide a more definitive answer, additional context would be required, detailing the exact methodologies employed for gathering the raw data used in these experiments.
