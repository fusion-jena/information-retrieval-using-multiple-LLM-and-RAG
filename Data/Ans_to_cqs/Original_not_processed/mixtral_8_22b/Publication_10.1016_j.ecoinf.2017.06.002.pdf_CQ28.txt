2. Methods

Our team-based project supports a dedicated data team that is
tightly integrated with an interdisciplinary group of earth scientists.
The data team encompasses responsibilities of data manager and data
distributor, and refers to persons assisting data originators in metadata
and data reporting, preserving data, and making data available to
consumers (Peng et al., 2016). The data team led the development of
FRAMES by working closely with data originators (the empiricists
collecting the observations), as well as data consumers (the empiricists
and also modelers using the data and metadata).

Finally, FRAMES was designed to facilitate submission to data re-
positories, including the NGEE Tropics Archive, the project's data re-
pository. The NGEE Tropics Archive has a web portal that allows data
originators to upload and download data packages. The Archive is
supported by a programmatic REST API built on top of Django Python
web framework with an easy-to-use web user interface built with
Foundation (Zurb, 2016) front-end framework. The Foundation front-
end framework is ﬂexible, highly customizable and provides support for
responsive, light-weight HTML for mobile application support. Django
is a fully featured open-source Python web application framework that
supports rapid development. Django makes the low-level framework
decisions so that the development is primarily focused on the applica-
tion domain rather than composing the framework features. NGEE
Tropics Archive manages the data package by storing the data package

Fig. 2. FRAMES (Framework for Reporting dAta and Metadata for Earth Systems). Data originators enter measurement setting description and data ﬁle description metadata via templates
ﬁles [M] that are linked to raw or processed data ﬁles [D]. Site/plot information (part of Measurement Setting Description) as well as Data Package Description are provided via on-line
templates. Links between key variables [K] illustrate how the metadata templates work in tandem.

These metadata include data package names and descriptions, Site ID
and Plot ID, authors, institutions, citations, acknowledgements, and
funding sources, as well as QA/QC status (Appendix E). The metadata
collected also describes access permissions for data usage. Required
ﬁelds for the data package description were determined as the
minimum set of information needed to obtain a DOI from Datacite
(Datacite, 2016) via the U.S. Department of Energy's Oﬃce of Science
and Technical Information (OSTI).

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any deep learning models being deployed nor which platform was used for deployment. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer based solely on this information.
