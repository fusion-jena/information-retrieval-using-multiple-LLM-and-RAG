5. Conclusion 

In this study, we proposed a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 
wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China’s Northeast Tiger 
and Leopard National Park. Based on this dataset, we employed 8 deep 
learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their per-
formance.  Our  results  indicate  that  deep  learning-based  approaches 
have the potential to detect wild birds in camera traps efficiently. By 
applying  these  approaches,  manual  processing  costs  can  be  reduced, 
enabling  more  efficient  monitoring  of  wildlife  populations  over  wide 
areas and over time. Our findings can help conservation practitioners 
choose  appropriate  models  for  their  detection  tasks,  as  well  as  offer 
insight  on  the  use  of  deep  learning-based  technologies  to  improve 
wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through camera traps. The study proposes a dataset consisting of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species obtained using camera traps located in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This dataset was then used to evaluate the performance of eight different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection. Additionally, other studies have also made use of camera traps for data collection, such as those mentioned in the SNAPSHOT USA 2019, NACTI dataset, and Camera traps in Serengeti National Park. These studies captured high-frequency annotated camera trap images from various locations and time periods, which were then used for training and evaluating deep learning models.
