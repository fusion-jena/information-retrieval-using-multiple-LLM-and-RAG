specific projects often require detailed soil information from a particular 
site,  delving  below  the  soil  surface  and  taking  into  account  varying 
depths. Technicians typically gather this information through soil sur-
veys and present it as raw data to professionals. However, this format 
can  create  challenges  in  effectively  communicating  and  collaborating 
across  disciplines.  Various  research  efforts  have  made  strides  in 
addressing these concerns: Yang et al. (2022) developed a framework for 
the  preliminary  delineation  of  soil  profile  horizons;  Alqadad  et  al. 
(2017)  documented  several  accidents that occurred  during urban  soil 
investigation  due  to  outdated  soil  profile  information;  Temme  and 
Vanwalleghem (2016) introduced a new model linking landscape and 
soil profile evolution based on sensitivity analysis; Pourabdollah et al. 
(2012)  proposed  a  data  exchange  schema  for  soil  and  terrain  data;

retrieved  local  climate  data,  envisions  potential  avenues  to  exploit 
existing  remote  sensing  data  and  web-based  APIs.  For  instance,  the 
utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US 
soil moisture data can be beneficial. This could lead to the development 
of integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at 
varying degrees of granularity. Not only would this augment the inter-
operability of our system, but it would also foster enhanced multidis-
ciplinary  communication  at  the  developmental  stage,  consequently 
bolstering  collaborations  across  fields.  Nevertheless,  the  prospect  of 
identifying a unified data framework with global applicability remains 
uncertain to us.

The  core  principle  of  node-based  programming  pertains  to  the 
employment of an abstracted node model for the representation of data 
or a computing operator. Each “node” accepts zero or multiple inputs and 
yields outputs subsequent to executing a computing operation. The scope 
of these computational operations encompasses elementary arithmetic 
tasks  as well  as intricate customized functions  necessitating consider-
able computational resources. (Fig. 8). 

The  intricacy  of  project  development  for  users  is  predominantly 
contingent upon the assortment of nodes supplied by both the software 
development  team  (intrinsic  default  functions)  and  community  de-
velopers  (plugin  functions).  A  robust  platform  typically  reaps  the  ad-
vantages  of  an  active  community-driven  ecosystem,  encompassing 
hundreds of plugins contributed by an array of sources. This, in turn, 
enables an extensive scope of functionality and customization for the 
end-users.

In response to the escalating significance of environmental concerns, 
fostering interdisciplinary integration is crucial for the development of 
innovative and comprehensive solutions. The imperative for educating 
professionals across diverse fields in enhancing dialogue beyond their 
respective  disciplines has never been more pressing. As  landscape ar-
chitects  and  researchers,  we  have  engaged  in  numerous  projects  that 
encompass a broad spectrum of disciplines, acknowledging the pivotal 
role of soil science within various ecological systems. Through collab-
oration with experts in disciplines such as soil science, ecology, water 
management, and urban planning, we have recognized the need for a 
coherent communication approach that efficiently conveys information 
across  these  fields.  Accordingly,  this  paper  proposes  a  visualization 
system utilizing computational algorithms to streamline the visualiza-
