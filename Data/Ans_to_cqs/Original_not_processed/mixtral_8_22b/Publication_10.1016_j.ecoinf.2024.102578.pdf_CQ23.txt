Separate  two-class  models  were  trained  for  Finnmark  and  Yamal 
using  the  keras  package  in  R  (Allaire  and  Chollet,  2023)  with  a  Ten-
sorFlow  backend (Allaire  and Tang,  2023).  Preliminary trials  showed 
that region-specific models performed better. The ResNet-50 architec-
ture, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep (He et al., 
2015), was used to train the models with 55 epochs (number of times the 
algorithm goes through the entire training data set) and a batch size of 
64  (number  of  samples  to  work  through  before  updating  model  pa-
rameters)  with  a  one-cycle  learning  rate  (hyperparameter  controlling 
model  response  to  estimated  error  each  time  the  model  weights  are 
updated) policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001 
(Smith, 2018).

Our approach combines training custom site-specific models that can 
be adapted to a new context in a flexible way with a highly performant 
openly available model, MegaDetector (Beery et al., 2019). Specifically, 
our approach consists of (1) identifying high-quality images, for which 
there is no model we are aware of currently available, (2) separating 
empty  images  from  images  with  animals,  humans,  or  vehicles,  (3) 
cropping out detected objects from images and classifying them by ob-
ject type (rock, bait, empty and species), and (4) manually inspecting a 
selection of images. We investigate trade-offs between false negatives 
and manual reviewing time, and we evaluate the benefit of several en-
hancements to the typical MegaDetector workflow.

Helpful Answer:

Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the keras package in R. This suggests that the authors may have employed some form of stratified splitting or similar technique to create location-specific models. Additionally, preliminary trials showed that these region-specific models performed better, indicating that the models might be more accurate when applied to their respective regions. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether other techniques such as diverse datasets or cross-validation were utilized.
