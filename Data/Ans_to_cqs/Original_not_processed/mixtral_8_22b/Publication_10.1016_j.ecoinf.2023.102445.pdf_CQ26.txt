enriches  gradient  flow  information  while  maintaining  a  lightweight 
structure.  The  SPPF  module  is  a  module  for  processing  objects  with 
different scales. It modifies parallel max pooling into a combination of 
serial  and  parallel  modes,  enhancing  the  model's  resilience  to  spatial 
layout and object degradation. This module involves a standard Conv 
operation, followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The 
results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow 
semantic  features,  which  subsequently  passed  through  a  final  Conv 
module. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network 
and the head network. Feature fusion is performed using two network 
architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggre-
gation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale 
feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of feature

(AdaptiveAvgPool). These operations generate lc
Avg. The output 
size of both branches is set to match the size of the m feature map. The 
resulting feature maps from these two branches subsequently summed to 
yield the lc
Max+Avg, and m 
feature maps are concatenated for subsequent processing. In this mod-
ule,  the  attention  mechanism  is  introduced  during  the  concatenation 
operation.  Network  training  yields  three  weight  values,  each  corre-
sponding to one of the feature maps. These weights are subsequently 
applied to the respective feature maps. A greater influence on the model 
is associated with a higher weight, while a lesser influence receives a 
lower weight. Each feature map is then multiplied by its weight before 
being concatenated alongside the others.

Y(i, j, c_out) represents the calculation result at position (i, j), the 
output channel c_out in the output feature map, X is the input image, the 
size of H_in × W_in × c_in, Y is the output image, and the size of H_out ×
W_out × c_out. Conv2d is a 2D convolution operation performed based 
on  the  input  X,  output  Y,  kernel  k,  step  size  s,  and  group  setting. 
BatchNorm2d  represents  the  batch  normalization  operation,  which  is 
used to normalize the convolution output and improve training stability. 
Then, the chunk is partitioned vertically and divided into two parts 
along the channel dimension. For the two branches, the size obtained is

H × W × C/2. First, Conv is applied to halve the number of channels, the 
feature size becomes H × W × C/4, and the calculation formulas are 
shown in Formula (3) and Formula (4). 

cv11(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

cv21(i, j, c out) = Conv(X, Y, k = 3, s = 1)

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is split into training and testing sets such that they maintain the same class proportions as in the original dataset. Oversampling is a method where the minority class samples are duplicated or synthetically generated to balance the classes. Undersampling is another approach where majority class samples are randomly removed to achieve balanced classes. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from various sources to reduce bias.

These methods can be employed individually or combined depending on the nature and extent of the data bias present in the dataset. Proper application of these techniques helps mitigate data bias and improves the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.
