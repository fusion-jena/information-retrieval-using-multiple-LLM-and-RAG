This is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge to investigate the pheno-
logical features in improving the performance of deep learning. As re-
vealed in our results, we have seen great potential in developing phe-
nological knowledge based deep learning methods. Recent literature
has documented the applications and beneﬁts of deep learning, a new
branch of machine learning, in various ﬁelds (LeCun et al., 2015).
However, it is still a controversial topic whether deep learning is more
suitable than traditional machine learning methods for Landsat image
classiﬁcation (Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Li et al., 2016). Never-
theless, this study aims to evaluate the hypotheses that applying phe-
nological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the
performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniﬂora. A comparison
experiment between SAE and SVM with six diﬀerent types of Landsat
images was conducted (see Table 2). The best performance was

hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene.
With the Ppf-CM-derived phenological feature as inputs, we took a step further to investigate the performance of
the latest deep learning method as opposed to that of the conventional support vector machine (SVM); Lastly, we
strive to understand how S. alterniﬂora has changed its spatial distribution in the Beibu Gulf of China from 1995
to 2017. As a result, we found (1) the developed Ppf-CM method can mitigate the phonological variation and
augment the spectral separability between S. alterniﬂora and the background species regardless of the signiﬁcant
cloud coverage in the study area; (2) deep learning, compared to SVM, presented better potentials for in-
corporating the new phenological features generated from the Ppf-CM method; and (3) for the ﬁrst time, we
discovered a S. alterniﬂora invasion outbreak occurred during 1996–2001.

et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). A growing number of studies to date
(e.g. Heydari and Mountrakis, 2018; Ishii et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016)
have been reported on classiﬁcation of remote sensing images at
moderate spatial resolution with deep learning. For example, deep
learning method (Stacked AutoEncoder, SAE) and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g. Support Vector Machine, SVM) were compared
to map African land-cover (Li et al., 2016). It was reported that SAE
achieved a higher classiﬁcation accuracy than SVM. However, in one of
the latest developments, Heydari and Mountrakis (2018) conducted an
experiment on land cover classiﬁcation using the deep learning method
(SAE) with 26 Landsat images. Surprisingly, the results indicated that
the classiﬁcation accuracy of deep learning was not as good as tradi-
tional machine learning methods, e.g. SVM. Therefore, it is still a well-
worthy topic to investigate which kind of methods is better, deep

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study investigates the application of phenological knowledge as input data for deep learning in detecting invasive S. alterniflora. This suggests that the data format could be related to remote sensing or satellite imagery, such as Landsat images, since these are commonly used for studying vegetation patterns and land cover changes. Additionally, the study compares the performance of Stacked AutoEncoders (SAE), a type of deep learning model, with Support Vector Machines (SVM), a traditional machine learning algorithm, indicating that the data format should be suitable for both models. In conclusion, while the exact data format is not specified, it can be inferred that the study uses some form of remote sensing or satellite imagery data for the deep learning pipeline.
