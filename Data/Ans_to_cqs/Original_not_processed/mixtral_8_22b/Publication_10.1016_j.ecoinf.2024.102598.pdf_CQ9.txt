Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The paper does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset used was obtained from the Forest Survey of India (FSI). Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.

Unhelpful Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub.

Explanation: This answer is unhelpful because it provides incorrect information. The paper does not mention anything about using GitHub as a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
