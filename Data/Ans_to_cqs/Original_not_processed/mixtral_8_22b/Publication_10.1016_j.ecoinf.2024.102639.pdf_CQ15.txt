validation error, thereby enhancing model precision.  

• The  selection  of  the  distance  metric,  typically  Euclidean,  was 
predicated on the data’s characteristics and the specific analytical 
prerequisites.  

was dictated by the explained variance ratio, to ensure the distilled 
dataset retained the majority of the original data’s variance.  
• The  SVM  model  was  thereafter  trained  on  this  dimensionally 
reduced  dataset,  with  hyperparameters  refined  as  delineated 
above.

• The  regularization  parameter  (‘C’)  and  the  kernel  type  (linear) 
were  calibrated  through  a  synergistic  application  of  grid  search 
and  cross-validation,  aiming  to  mediate  the  balance  between 
model complexity and its generalization prowess.

• In  instances  involving  non-linear  SVMs,  the  kernel  coefficient 
(‘gamma’) underwent optimization via grid search, ensuring the 
model’s attunement to the data distribution.

• Commencing  with  dimensionality  reduction  via  Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA), the number of components preserved

5.3.3. Results analysis and comparison 

The integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classification  algorithms  (see  (Bansal  et  al.,  2022; 
Boateng  et  al.,  2020)),  along  with  a  Principal  Component  Analysis- 
Support  Vector  Machine  (PCA-SVM)  hybrid  approach  (Hai  and  An, 
2016), has significantly enhanced our understanding of zebrafish and rat 
movements within T-maze environments. This comprehensive analysis, 
as  detailed  in  Tables  3  and  4,  showcases  the  detailed  insights  gained 
from these methodologies. For zebrafish, the KNN model demonstrated 
high precision and recall in identifying left movements, with impressive

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, the context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
