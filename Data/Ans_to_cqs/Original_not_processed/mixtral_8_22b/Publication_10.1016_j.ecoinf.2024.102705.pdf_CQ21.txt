3.1. Implementation details 

The training protocol outlined by (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) was 
followed during the training process. The YOLOv3 model served as the 
baseline for all experiments. To expand the training dataset, various data 
augmentation  techniques  were  employed,  including  random  adjust-
ments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. The AIP- 
OD  model  was  trained  using  the  Adam  optimizer  (Kingma  and  Ba, 
2014). The training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 
(cid:0) 4and gradually decreased to 
4. The learning rate initially started at 10
over  the  course  of  training.  The  experiments  were  conducted  using 
Tensorflow 1.14 and executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU.

The evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) 
as a mainstream performance metric. AP represents the area under the 
precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different 
thresholds.

feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

process. The NLPP network, as shown in Table 4, comprises seven layers 
and encompasses a mere 150 K parameters. To extract environmental 
features effectively, a non-local layer (Wang et al., 2018) is incorporated 
within  the  NLPP  network  to  capture  long-term  dependencies  in  the 
images. The NLPP module is trained to generate more suitable hyper-
parameters for the DIP module.

The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

Helpful Answer:
After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, based on the given context, the main focus seems to be on evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Average Precision (AP). This involves calculating precision and recall values at different thresholds and determining the area under the resulting precision-recall curve.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Non-Local Parameter Prediction (NLPP) network for generating hyperparameters for the Deep Image Prior (DIP) module. While not explicitly stated, this could potentially involve additional postprocessing steps related to fine-tuning these hyperparameters or analyzing their impact on the overall performance of the system.

However, without further information about the specific implementation details or goals of the project, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of all possible postprocessing steps that may be involved. Some other common postprocessing tasks include visualizing saliency maps to understand how the model is making its predictions, creating confusion matrices to evaluate classification accuracy, and performing error analysis to identify areas where the model is struggling.
