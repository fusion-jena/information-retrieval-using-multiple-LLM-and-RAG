Practically, over/underﬁtting diﬃculties in neural net-
work models are caused by the neural network model’s
excessive/insuﬃcient training epochs [43]. As a result, one
possible solution to the DL-based model’s over/underﬁtting
concerns is to apply the early stopping strategy [44], which is
used to cease training when generalisation performance
starts to degrade for a number of epochs. To track the
generalisation performance,
in the proposed model, the
training data is separated into training and validation
groups.

+e dropout approach [45] is another way to deal with
the overﬁtting problem. Dropout is a regularisation strategy
that allows you to train neural networks with alternative
topologies in parallel by randomly dropping out a certain
proportion of layer neurons. Dropout is indicated by the
black neurons in the fully connected layers, as seen in
Figure 3.

and Oceanographic Agency. +en, we proposed comparing these three predictive approaches on four diﬀerent evaluation metrics.
Experimental results have revealed that the deep learning model slightly outperformed the machine learning models for overall
performance, and both of these approaches greatly outperformed the statistical predictive model.

+e proposed work is motivated by comparing the statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models to understand
the performance gap of these models. +e results of this

better the marine data. To anticipate the marine features
eﬃciently, the employed deep learning model combines the
gated recurrent units (GRU) with the regular neural net-
work. In the proposed architecture, the GRU layer is pre-
ceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected
layer. As a result, the predicted values can be produced from
the output layer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of a
GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
Besides, four diﬀerent ML models have been utilized in the
current study, namely, Linear Regression (LR), Decision

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. This dataset likely included various scenarios and conditions, ensuring that the model could learn patterns applicable to different situations. Secondly, the training data was divided into two groups - training and validation sets. The separation of data allowed for tracking the generalization performance of the model during training. Lastly, the early stopping strategy was applied to prevent overfitting or underfitting concerns. This technique involves halting the training process once the model's performance starts to deteriorate after a specific number of epochs. By implementing these measures, the researchers aimed to enhance the robustness and applicability of their deep learning model across different marine environments.
