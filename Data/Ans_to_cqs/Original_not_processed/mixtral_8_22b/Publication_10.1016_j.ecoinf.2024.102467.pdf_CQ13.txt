EfficientnetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. 
The  EfficientNet  series  comprises  a  set  of  lightweight  convolutional 
neural networks. In the EfficientNetV1 series, Google’s focus was pre-
dominantly on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and compu-
tational  requirements  of  the  model  (Tan  and  Le,  2019).  The 
EfficientNetV2  series  further  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations  while  preserving  the  accuracy  of  the  model,  leading  to 
significant  decreases  in  model  training  and  inference  duration. 
Furthermore, the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive 
learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method 
based on the training image size. This method can improve the training 
speed  and  accuracy  of  the  network.  Compared  with  some  previous 
networks, the experimental results of this method show that the training

speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced 
by  1/6.8  (Tan  and  Le,  2021).  Based  on  this  network,  we  designed  a 
backbone  to  improve  the  training  speed  of  the  model  while  ensuring 
detection accuracy and speed.

A  bottleneck  transformer  is  a  simple  but  powerful  transformer 
structure. Self-attention models in the field of vision can be classified 
into  Pure  Attention  Models  and  Convolution  Attention  Models.  The 
advantage of convolution-based models is their parameter sharing and 
efficient local information aggregation capabilities. To integrate global 
information, convolution-based models require the stacking of multiple 
convolutional layers. Self-attention, on the other hand, has the ability to 
obtain  global  information.  Therefore,  combining  self-attention  and 
convolution  can  reduce  the  network  depth  and  improve  the  model’s 
performance. BoTNet replaces the 3 × 3 spatial convolutions in ResNet’s 
last  three  bottleneck  blocks  with  multi-head  self-attention  (MHSA) 
(Srinivas et al., 2021). The memory and computational requirements for 
self-attention  are  quadratic  in  the  spatial  dimension,  and  these  re-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that EfficientNetV2 utilizes an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. Additionally, it discusses how the EfficientNetV2 series focuses on reducing the number of parameters and computations while maintaining the accuracy of the model, resulting in significant improvements in training and inference durations compared to previous networks.

For more detailed information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, one would need to refer to the original research papers or source code related to EfficientNetV2. Some common hyperparameters found in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, weight decay, momentum, and dropout rate. These values can greatly impact the performance and convergence of the model during training.
