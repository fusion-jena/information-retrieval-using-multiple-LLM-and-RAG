In the initial algorithm, MSNet constructs the FEN by stacking rule 
residual blocks to capture the appearance information. However, owing 
to the depth and structure of the network, the original residual network 
can only  extract  shallow  features, and  it  is  challenging  to extract  the 
deeper features of the target. The shallow network is adept at capturing 
the target’s location and appearance information, but struggles to pro-
vide detailed target information. To address the occlusion challenges in 
MOT scenarios, it is imperative to introduce deeper networks. However, 
the multiple downsampling stages in these deeper networks result in a 
lower resolution for the final feature map layer, which diminishes the 
effectiveness of the information for small targets in the output feature

Inspired  by  Res2Net,  a  novel  residual  network  structured  with 
Res2Net modules and group convolution was introduced to replace the 
FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-
scale representation in the Deep SORT FEN, achieving a more intricate 
and detailed level of feature-extraction.

The conventional residual structure is shown in Fig. 7(a) involves an 
initial dimension reduction through a 1 × 1 convolutional kernel, fol-
lowed by feature-extraction using a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel. Subse-
quently,  the  dimensionality  was  increased  by  another  1  × 1 
convolutional  kernel,  and  the  results  were  combined  with  shortcut 
branches.  Although this traditional residual structure effectively miti-
gates  the  degradation  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
network  layers,  it  falls  short  in  terms  of  deep  exploration  and  MSF 
integration.  By  contrast,  the  residual  structure  within  the  Res2Net 
framework  was  combined  with  group  convolution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure  Fig.  7(b)  follows  a  different  approach.  It  begins  with  initial 
downscaling  through  a  1  × 1  convolution  kernel.  The  downsampled 
feature  maps  were  then  organized  into  different  channel  dimensions,

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Helpful Answer:

Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data or test data. Regularization helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization capabilities. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, dropout adds randomness to the training process, making the model more robust and less likely to overfit. During each iteration of the training phase, individual nodes are either dropped out of the net with probability (1 - keep_prob), or kept with probability keep_prob.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another popular method to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights in the model. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, hence the name L2 regularization. By keeping the weights small, L2 regularization encourages simpler models that generalize better to new data.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 regularization are effective techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. While Dropout introduces randomness to the training process, L2 regularization penalizes large weights in the model. Both methods help to create simpler models that perform well on unseen data.
