Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various sources such as Bean et al. (2012), Blondel et al. (2011), Pejchar & Mooney (2009), Pham et al. (2021), Phillips & Dudík (2008), but it doesn't provide any direct reference to a specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
