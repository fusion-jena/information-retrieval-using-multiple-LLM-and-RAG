hyperparameters for model architectures.  

2.  Partial training: Models are partially trained (on a small fraction of 
the data) to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations.  
3.  Successive Halving: The remaining configurations are grouped into 
sets of different sizes, and the associated models are trained further. 
The best-performing configurations in each set are promoted to the 
next  stage,  while 
the  under-performing  configurations  are 
eliminated. 

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until only one configuration re-
mains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

For more details on the theory of the elements discussed we refer the 
reader to the reference book (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This architecture 
involves  a  large  number  of  hyperparameters  related  to  the  different 
types of layers (convolutional or recurrent) and therefore a large number 
of  parameters.  As  a  reminder,  a  parameter  is  internal  to  the  neural 
network.  It  will  evolve  during  the  whole  training  process  A  hyper-
parameter is external to the training process, it defines the properties of 
the network. It remains static during the training process. 

The  HyperBand  algorithm  is  proposed  for  optimisation  and  is 

described in the next section.

The key idea behind Hyperband is to explore several configurations 
in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising con-
figurations. This enables a more efficient search of the hyperparameter 
space, particularly when computational resources are limited. In sum-
mary, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a ‘successive 
halving’  strategy  to  quickly  identify  promising  configurations  while 
eliminating those that show inferior performance. 

The  detail  of  the  grid  of  possible  combinations  is  presented.  The 
number of convolution layers is lower than that given in the article, the 
network has two convolution layers. Their size and the associated max- 
pooling will be determined in the following interval for each:

described in the next section. 

During the training of the model, the data is then standardized. In 
section 4, one of the three datasets will be defined as a training base, on 
which the standardizaion parameters will be calculated and applied to 
the  other  two  datasets  considered  as  test  base.  The  best  result  of  the 
optimisation will allow us to determine the base that will be used for 
training.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the model likely includes hyperparameters related to its architecture, including the types of layers (convolutional or recurrent), the number of layers, and their respective sizes. Additionally, since the text mentions using the HyperBand algorithm for optimization, this suggests that there may also be hyperparameters related to the training process itself, such as batch size, epochs, or early stopping criteria. Ultimately, without additional context or clarification, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
