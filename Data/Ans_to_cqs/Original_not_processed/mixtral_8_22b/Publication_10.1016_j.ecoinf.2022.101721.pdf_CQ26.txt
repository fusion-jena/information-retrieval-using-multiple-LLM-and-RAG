in  predicting  means,  SDs  and  finally  population  sizes  based  on  the 
observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

Imagine  a  recording  of  a  Pipistrellus  sp.,  where  a  researcher  uses 
published means of fmaxe  to determine which species is most likely to 
have produced the echolocation calls. Based on this single piece of in-
formation, the researcher concludes that the calls are in the zone where 
fmaxe of P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus overlap. However, the researcher 
observes that the recording may fit P. pipistrellus better due to relatively 
low frequencies (say somewhere in the range 48–51 kHz), and therefore 
estimates that approximately 30% of P. pipistrellus are likely to produce 
pulses at such frequencies during their nightly hunting bout, whereas 
only 10% of P. pygmaeus will do the same. Based on this limited piece of 
information,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  P.  pipistrellus  is  the  most 

outcome of 75% or

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using published means of fmaxe to determine the species most likely to have produced echolocation calls. This suggests that researchers use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the observed data. Additionally, the R-code mentioned in the text allows users to adopt different means and standard deviations (SDs) depending on local features of the study area. This could potentially help reduce data bias by taking into account variations in the environment and behavior of the studied organisms. While the text does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques can still be applied to address data bias in the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. For instance, stratified splitting ensures that each class has equal representation in both training and testing datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios.
