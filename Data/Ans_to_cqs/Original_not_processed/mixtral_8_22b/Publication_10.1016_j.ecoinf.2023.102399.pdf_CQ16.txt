Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training. When these values reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it may indicate that further training will not yield better results, suggesting that the training process can be stopped. In some cases, early stopping techniques might also be employed to prevent overfitting and halt training once performance on a separate validation set stops improving.
