Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various sources from which data was obtained. These include NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. The sources for these data range from Google Earth Engine, National Climatic Data Center, Copernicus Climate Change Service, OpenStreetMap, and Resource and Environmental Science Data Center. It can be inferred that the data collection methods could involve satellite imagery, weather stations, open-source databases, and other similar resources. But without more specific details, it is impossible to definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
