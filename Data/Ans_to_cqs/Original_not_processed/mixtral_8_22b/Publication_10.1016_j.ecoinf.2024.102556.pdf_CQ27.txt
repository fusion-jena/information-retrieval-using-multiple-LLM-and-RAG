Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

As shown in Table 2, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower 
than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. In addition, the number 
of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allo-
cated  by  the  Deep  SORT  model.  This  indicates  that  the  FEN  network 
extracts more and richer target information features in the process of

The target objects were tracked and identified in a scene with high 
dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 was determined as the 
baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of 
the airborne computer, as mentioned above. Formulated by Wang et al. 
(2021), this model can achieve this objective by integrating Extended 
Efficient  Layer  Aggregation  Network  (E-ELAN)  (Gao  et  al.,  2021), 
cascade-based modeling (DollÂ´ar et al., 2021) model scaling, and model 
reparameterization (Vasu et al., 2023). Among the YOLO family mem-
bers,  YOLOv7  (Wang  et  al.,  2023)  is  characterized  with  faster  target 
detection and a three-module structure (the input module, the backbone 
module,  and  the  header  network),  as  explicated  in  Fig.  4.  The  input 
module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size. The 
backbone  module,  similar  to  other  network  structures,  extracts  deep

to learn features of various sizes, leading to potential matching errors 
when the scale of the target changes. To address these shortcomings, it is 
imperative  to  introduce  a  multiscale  feature-extraction  network 
(MSNet).

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we do know that the models used are part of the YOLO family, specifically YOLOv7, which is known for its fast target detection capabilities. It also has a three-module structure consisting of the input module, the backbone module, and the header network. Additionally, the text mentions that the baseline model was chosen to balance the limited computational power and speed of the airborne computer. This suggests that the deployment platform might be an airborne computer or UAV due to the keywords 'airborne computer', 'UAV MOT', and 'Procapra przewalskii monitoring'. But without further details, it's not possible to give specific steps regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection.
