In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

The  method  based  on  ANN  is  the  most  actively  used  method  for 
modeling DO concentrations worldwide. Except for a few scholars who 
use single-layer neural networks (Flores et al., 2024), MLPNN, which is 
the most widely used ANN architecture, is a feedforward ANN that was 
previously used in modeling DO concentration of water (He et al., 2011; 
Saber  et  al.,  2020;  Singh  et  al., 2009).  The  three  typical  feedforward 
neural  networks,  namely  radial  basis  function  neural  networks 
(RBFNN),  general  regional  neural  networks  (GRNN),  and  ELMs,  each 
have  their  advantages  and  are  continually  discussed  by  researchers 
(Chen et al., 2020; Keshtegar and Heddam, 2018). RBFNN displays good 
performance,  approaching  that  of  arbitrary  non-linear  functions,  re-
quires simple training, and overcomes local minima with fast learning 
convergence.  It  is  one  of  the  DO  concentration  prediction  algorithms

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for various tasks like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Without more context or details regarding the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text, it is impossible to determine which data annotation techniques have been employed.
