4.1. Model performance 

The model achieved F1 scores above 0.991 on all the training and 
0.934 on all validation data (Table 2). For the testing data, it generalised 
exceptionally  well  over  time  at  all  locations  (“test-over_time”)  with 
scores above 0.934. Moreover, a nearly perfect F1 score was also ob-
tained  at  locations  it  had  never  seen  before  (“test-over_location”) 
reaching F1 scores of 0.985, 1, and 1 (see an example in Fig. 5). In Table 
S2, we report the F1 scores as well as the number of actual nests, TP, FP 
and FN for each individual orthomosaic. Notably, the three orthomo-
saics  in  test-over_location  contained  48  nests.  The  model  correctly

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used standard practices such as tracking metrics like accuracy, loss, or F1 scores during the training process. Additionally, they could have employed techniques like cross-validation or using separate datasets for training, validation, and testing to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
