Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. The table and text only provide details about various datasets used for ecological studies, including NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. These datasets were obtained from different sources like Google Earth Engine, NOAA, Copernicus Climate Change Service, OpenStreetMap, and others. Additionally, it was mentioned that some data had their spatial resolution adjusted, but no further details regarding data augmentation techniques were provided.
