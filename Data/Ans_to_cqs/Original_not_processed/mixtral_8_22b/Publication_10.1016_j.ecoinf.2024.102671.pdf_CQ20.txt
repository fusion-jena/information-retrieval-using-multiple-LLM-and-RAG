%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized for this purpose.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing ecological carbon sink risk zones using various factors such as temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, socio-economic factors like GDP and population, food production, and spatial resolution data from multiple sources. The research also involves calculating stability within each ecological carbon sink risk zone, AI, and factor loadings of principal components on different landscape indices. However, there is no mention of any hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.
