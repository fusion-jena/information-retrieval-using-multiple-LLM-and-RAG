Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.6. Model selection 

Since  performance,  accuracy,  key  parameters,  and  sensitivity  for 
prediction vary depending on which method that is used (Diniz-Filho 
et al., 2009; Elith et al., 2006; Qiao et al., 2015), we tested eight different 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  our  predictive  models.  The 
included  algorithms  were:  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM),  Support 
Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Multivariate  Adaptive  Regression  Spline 
(MARS),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Flexible  Discriminant  Analysis  (FDA), 
Classification  and  Regression  Trees  (CART),  Generalized  Boosting 
regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for 
habitat suitability prediction (Table S5). 

2.7. Ensemble modeling approach

The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

(Phillips et al., 2006). To ensure the processing of both continuous and 
categorical  discrete  values  in  the  metadata,  selected  algorithms  with 
regression and classification prediction tasks were used. Mapping fore-
casts of different algorithms in the ensemble approach were evaluated 
by assessing the accuracy and performance of the final models.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred from the context that various machine learning algorithms were tested to generate predictive models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). These algorithms have their own ways of handling hyperparameter optimization, but the exact methods used in this case are not mentioned in the provided context.
