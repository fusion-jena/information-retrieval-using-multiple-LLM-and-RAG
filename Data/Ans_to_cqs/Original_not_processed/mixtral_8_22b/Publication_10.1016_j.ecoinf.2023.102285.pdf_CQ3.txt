directory by the proposed technique in this study, which is proposed as a 
future work in Section 6. Bespoke semi-supervised ML approaches (e.g., 
SelfMatch in (Xing et al., 2022a)) can be a good candidate for addressing 
this type of research question by extracting features from labelled data 
and comparing them with the features that are obtained from detected 
ISMMMOs based on the semantic information (e.g., (Xiao et al., 2022) 
and  a  feature/distance-based  matching  scheme  (e.g.,  (Xing  et  al.,

There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given references, it appears that there isn't explicit mention of the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on common practices in similar fields.

Deep learning pipelines often use various data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. These techniques help in labeling the dataset, which is crucial for training machine learning algorithms.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects in an image to identify their location. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks. Instance segmentation goes one step further by outlining the exact shape of each object in addition to its location. Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves assigning a category to every pixel in an image.

Given that the paper discusses detecting and locating specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches, it is likely that these methods have been employed. For example, bounding boxes could be used to locate vessels and oil platforms in remote optical imagery, while instance segmentation might be applied to distinguish between different types of MMOs.

However, without more specific details about the data annotation process used in the referenced papers, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. Further reading of the cited works would be necessary to confirm the exact data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines.
