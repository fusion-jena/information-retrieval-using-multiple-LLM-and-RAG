expected that creating a mask to delineate the “area of applicability” for 
the trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) would successfully filter 
out a significant portion of regions lacking training data, particularly in

Forests (VSURF; Genuer et al., 2022; Speiser, 2021; Speiser et al., 2019). 
RFE  retains  variables  based  on  their  importance  in  explaining  the 
response variable (Khun, 2022), while the VSURF method goes a step 
further  by  assessing  how  these  important  variables  contribute to  pre-
dicting  the  response  variable  and  retains  only  those  that  lead  to  a 
reduction in prediction error (Genuer et al., 2022). To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to develop random 
forest models for predicting relative tsetse fly numbers by integrating in- 
situ  tsetse  catches  with  satellite-based  variables.  Furthermore,  the 
impact of different feature elimination techniques on tsetse predictions 
has not been assessed previously.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two methods used for feature elimination and improving model performance: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help reduce overfitting and improve generalization by selecting relevant features from the dataset. While they do not directly address data bias, they can indirectly mitigate its effects by reducing noise and irrelevant information in the input data.
