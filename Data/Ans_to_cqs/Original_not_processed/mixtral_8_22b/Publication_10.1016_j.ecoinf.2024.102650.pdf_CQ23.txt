Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions that machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word segmentation and stop word removal, which are common steps in preparing datasets for training and testing machine learning models. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model, which has been shown to perform well in various Chinese language tasks, including a mixed-language emotional analysis task. This suggests that the authors may have considered the diversity of their dataset when selecting a suitable deep learning model. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is difficult to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study.
