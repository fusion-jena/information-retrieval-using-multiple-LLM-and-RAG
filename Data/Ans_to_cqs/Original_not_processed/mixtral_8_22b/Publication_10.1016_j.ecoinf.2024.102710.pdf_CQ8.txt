Fig. 4. UMAP plots for different embedding layers of different embedding
models for AnuraSet. For UMAP generation, we randomly select 5000 samples
and discard all samples that are aligned to more than one class. Colors and
shapes indicate the 10 classes with the highest occurrence frequency. Layers are
numbered according to their distance from the classification layer, e.g. ‘Bird-
Net-1’ is the last layer before the classification layer of the BirdNet model.

The active learning experiments are carried out in the embedding
space of the selected transfer learning model (BirdNet-1, see Section
3.1). We explore a range of sampling strategies: uncertainty and di-
versity based, myopic (greedy) and adaptive (batch mode), and com-
binations thereof. Fig. 2 provides a schematic overview of the pure
families of sampling strategies: Random sampling selects samples arbi-
trarily, uncertainty sampling targets samples near the decision bound-
ary, and diversity sampling focuses on samples that span the entire data
space. In all cases, 5% of the samples are selected at random. Class labels
are available for all samples used in this study, and an active learning
scenario is emulated by hiding all labels from the classifier at first and
incrementally revealing the ones for each batch of samples queried by
the sampling methods. We use a batch size of 20 samples. The classifier
heads are identical to those from the transfer learning training process.

evaluation was done on focal and citizen-science datasets. Swaminathan
et al. (2024) extend the observation to attention-based architectures pre-
trained on human speech. Lauha et al. (2022) show that transfer
learning can be helpful also for small networks trained from scratch on
small, targeted datasets gathered from online resources such as Mac-
aulay Library2 (as opposed to foundation models trained on large
datasets). While the works cited above evaluate transfer learning models
based on classification performance, McGinn et al. (2023) take a
different approach and investigate the topology of fine grained, sub-
species sound events in the embedding space afforded by BirdNet;
they find that different call types of a same species (e.g., drumming
versus vocalization) form distinct clusters, and that the vicinity of each

ResNet-50 variant (no transfer learning), and the small size of their
validation set (6.25 h, or 0.003% of the data) precludes comparing
different active learning methods. Similarly, van Osta et al. (2023) use
transfer learning (ResNet seemingly pre-trained on ImageNet) and an
active learning strategy to train a classifier for a single cryptic bird
species, but do not compare different active learning strategies.

Helpful Answer:
The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. Specifically, it can be found at <https://github.com/HKathman/pam_annotation_experiments>. Additionally, other relevant repositories include <https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main/checkpoints/V2.4>, which contains checkpoints for the BirdNET-Analyzer V2.4, and <https://tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1> and <https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1>, which provide TensorFlow Hub modules for audio feature extraction using VGGish and YAMNet, respectively.
