Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize many 
samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid 
overfitting,  the  validation  data  were  employed  for  tuning  the  key 
hyperparameters for each model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters 
set for each model during training and validation.

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

extract  hierarchical  features  at  various  scales,  encompassing  edges, 
textures, and more intricate elements. By autonomously deriving rele-
vant  features  from  the  data,  deep  learning  eliminates  the  need  for 
manual  feature  engineering  and  reduces  manual  effort.  Furthermore, 
deep  learning  techniques  facilitate  the  generation  of  real-time  LULC 
information.  Recurrent  Neural  Network  (RNN)  models,  in  particular, 
demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns 
continuously. This adaptability enables the model to capture temporal 
shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Transfer learning techniques 
enhance the model's compatibility with new situations or different study 
areas. Additionally, integrating deep learning techniques with the GEE 
platform through the Google Cloud platform allows for dynamic LULC 
mapping by incorporating satellite imagery and real-time observations.

Despite the powerful capabilities of the GEE, which provides a wide 
range of functionalities for spatial data analysis, processing, and inter-
pretation, this research encountered multiple limitations when using it 
for  classification.  These  limitations  include  computational  time  con-
straints, data processing  volume, and the combination of various fea-
tures  within  the  platform.  In  cases  where  the  study  area  is  vast,  the 
model training process requires many sample points to ensure training 
data  completeness.  When  dealing  with  complex  LULC  schemes,  using 
high-resolution  imagery  and  combining  various  spectral  features  and 
indices  becomes  essential.  Moreover,  in  such  complex  scenarios, 
adjusting the parameters of ML models is also necessary. It is not always 
possible to handle a USGS 24 classification process for a large area with a 
high-capacity model by employing a high volume of sample data. For

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to classify LULC based on satellite imagery. These models can effectively recognize intricate patterns and extract hierarchical features at various scales, including edges, textures, and other complex elements. They eliminate the need for manual feature engineering and reduce manual effort. Furthermore, these techniques allow for the generation of real-time LULC information. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously, capturing temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns.
