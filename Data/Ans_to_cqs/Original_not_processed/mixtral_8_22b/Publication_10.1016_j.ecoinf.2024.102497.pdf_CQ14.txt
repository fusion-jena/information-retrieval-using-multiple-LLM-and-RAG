The Random Forest model  is an  ensemble learning  technique that 
combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  make  predictions.  In  regression 
tasks, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm constructs several 
independent  decision  trees  by  randomly  sampling  data  and  features. 
Each  tree  generates  predictions,  and  the  final  regression  result  is  ob-
tained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. Notably, 
the RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of 
overfitting. The RFR method is particularly advantageous in nearshore 
bathymetry  studies,  as  it  doesn’t  require  prior  knowledge  of  water 
properties  or  seabed  type,  enhancing  accuracy  in  predicting  water 
depths.  To  implement  the  RFR  model,  we  utilized  the  Python  pro-
gramming  language,  importing  the  RFR  algorithm  from  the  ‘sklearn’ 
library.  Fine-tuning  the  model  parameters  -  such  as  ‘n_estimators’,

Advancements  in  bathymetry  retrieval  methods  have  led  to  the 
development  of  various  models,  including  linear  or  nonlinear  regres-
sion, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques 
such  as  CART,  RFR, and  SVM (Ashphaq et  al.,  2021; Cahalane et  al., 
2019; Lyzenga, 1978; Lyzenga et al., 2006). Gabr et al. (2020) utilized a 
linear model to estimate bathymetry and confirmed the equivalence of 
Landsat images to high-resolution PlanetScope (3 m) predictions. Sun 
et al. (2021) applied two regression tree models (CART and Cubist) to 
retrieve  coastal  bathymetry  and  analyze  vertical  water  environment 
information.  Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  employed  the  SVR  (support  vector 
regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in 
Arctic waters. However, despite several studies, the application of CART 
and  RFR  models  in  nearshore  turbid  waters  for  bathymetry  has  been

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the optimization of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model's hyperparameters involved conducting multiple experiments and comparisons. This process is often referred to as hyperparameter tuning. While the specific method used for this task isn't explicitly mentioned, common approaches include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based optimization. Given the nature of the problem and the fact that multiple experiments were conducted, it can be inferred that either Grid Search or Random Search might have been used. These methods involve defining a range of values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with different combinations of these values. The combination that yields the best performance is chosen as the optimal set of hyperparameters. It should be noted that without explicit mention of the method used, this remains an educated guess.
