modelling frameworks and combined with other types of data, thus, has 
the  potential  to  support  intergovernmental  policy  initiatives  such  as

adaptation  and  mitigation,  sustainable  land  use  and  conservation  of 
biodiversity.

bined with other types of data in an efficient, for example in a model- 
assisted framework (e.g., Ståhl et al., 2016) or hierarchical modelling

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions two modeling frameworks: model-assisted framework and hierarchical modeling. The model-assisted framework is exemplified by Ståhl et al. (2016), while hierarchical modeling is demonstrated by Saarela et al. (2016, 2018). These frameworks could potentially involve using deep learning techniques, but without further context, we cannot definitively state whether they employ TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another deep learning framework.
