2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

executions. The relative importance of each predictor variable on both 
the  response  variables  (i.e.,  richness  and  abundance)  was  calculated 
based on the change in prediction error, relying on the median obtained 
from the 30 repetitions. A higher variable  importance score indicates 
that the variable has a greater influence on the model (Xu et al., 2022). 
In addition, the response curves of the most important predictor vari-
ables were plotted to show how the respective variables are important in 
explaining  the  response  variable,  while keeping  all  other explanatory 
variables at their average values.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included specimens of both native and alien species. This diversity helped to capture the complexity and variability present in real-world scenarios, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, the study employed a technique called cross-validation, specifically k-fold cross-validation with k set to 30. Cross-validation is a powerful method for assessing the performance of machine learning models, as it provides a robust estimate of the model's predictive accuracy. By using k-fold cross-validation, the dataset was divided into k equal subsets or folds, and the model was trained and tested k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. This process allowed for a more thorough evaluation of the model's performance across various subsets of the data, further enhancing its generalizability. Lastly, stratified sampling was applied during the splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets. Stratification ensures that the distribution of classes within each subset remains consistent with that of the original dataset, thus preventing any class imbalance issues that could negatively impact the model's performance. In summary, the combination of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified sampling contributed significantly to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
