flight time and performance. Flying time and performance is linked to 
many weather factors like temperature, wind, precipitation, solar radi-
ation, and these factors combined dictate if and when honey bees will 
take flight.

3. Result and discussion 

The  proposed  Apis-FIS  for  mapping  the  suitability  of  beekeeping 
involved different data and expert knowledge. Due to the complex na-
ture of the activity, characterized by many relationships that need to be 
translated  into  rules,  we  proposed  to  characterize  from  one  to  many 
subsystems depending on their contribution to beekeeping activity.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.

Unhelpful Answer:
The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. However, without further context or details, it is impossible to determine which specific technique was used in this particular case.
