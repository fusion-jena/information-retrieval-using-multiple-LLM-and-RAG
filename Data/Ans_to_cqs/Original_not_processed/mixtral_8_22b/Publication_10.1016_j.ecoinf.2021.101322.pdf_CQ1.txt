other species, as well as for other hard parts of organisms (e.g., otoliths,

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involves salmon scales. However, the specific details about how these salmon scales were collected are not explicitly mentioned. It is possible that the salmon scales were obtained through surveys or sampling processes, but without further information, it cannot be confirmed. Additionally, there is mention of a pre-existing dataset called 'Salmon scale 9056 image dataset,' which suggests that some form of publicly available data may have been used in conjunction with any original data collection efforts. Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not fully detailed in the provided context, it seems likely that a combination of direct sampling and existing datasets were employed.
