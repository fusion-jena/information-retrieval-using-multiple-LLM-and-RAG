Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does touch upon related topics like dealing with out-of-distribution samples and scaling models based on the size and complexity of the training data.

To manage randomness in deep learning pipelines, common strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variance, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These approaches help mitigate the impact of randomness and improve overall performance and stability.
