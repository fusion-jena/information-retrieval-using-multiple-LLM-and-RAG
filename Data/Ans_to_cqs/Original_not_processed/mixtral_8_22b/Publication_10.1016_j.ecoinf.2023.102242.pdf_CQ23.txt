Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model when applied to new or unseen data.

The mention of Fig. 7 suggests that the study may have involved optimizing parameters for better performance, which could indirectly contribute to improving the model's generalizability. Additionally, the reference to refining the subsequent classification process indicates that efforts might have been made to enhance the overall accuracy and reliability of the model. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the exact steps taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
