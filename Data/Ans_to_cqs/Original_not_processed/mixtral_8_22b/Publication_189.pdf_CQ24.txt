This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using a fixed random seed value across different runs of the same experiment or model. This ensures consistency and reproducibility of results. Another strategy is employing techniques such as data augmentation and dropout regularization, which introduce controlled randomness into the model training process. Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to input data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to increase the diversity of training samples and improve generalization. Dropout regularization randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing overfitting and improving robustness. Additionally, ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of data or features. These strategies collectively contribute to building more reliable and accurate deep learning pipelines.

Unhelpful Answer:
Randomness in the deep learning pipeline can be handled by ignoring it completely. Since deep learning models are inherently complex and nonlinear, they should be able to learn patterns even when faced with random inputs. Therefore, there is no need to worry about controlling or managing randomness in the first place.
