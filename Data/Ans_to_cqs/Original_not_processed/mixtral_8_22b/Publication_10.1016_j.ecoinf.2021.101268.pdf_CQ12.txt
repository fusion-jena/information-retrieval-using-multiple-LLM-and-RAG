4.2. Architecture configurations 

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) outstand over DL techniques 
by disentangling high-level representations across multiple processing 
layers. CNN’s process data on two levels: a convolutional block for the 
automatic  feature  extraction,  and  fully  connected  layers  to  establish 
feature-output  correlation.  The  convolutional  block  comprises  con-
volutional,  ReLU,  and  max-pooling  layers.  Each  set  of  convolutional 
layers diversify features by applying a set of parallel filters that process 
local sections of the input space. The feature vector integrates low-level 
local features from the first layers and higher-level representations from 
the latest ones.

Like any other complex model, DL requires a large amount of data to 
fit appropriately, which is hard in our context. To overcome this limi-
tation, we employ different architectures pre-trained with the ImageNet 
dataset. Pre-trained models capture low-level features (e.g., edges, cor-
ners, color spots, etc.) from one domain and transfer them to another 
with  similar  characteristics.  The  transfer  process  is  called  fine-tuning 
due  to  the  model  only  learns  specific  higher-level  features  (e.g.,  ar-
rangements, venations, etc.). We compare four pre-trained models: (1) 
AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012, 2) VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 
2014, 3) ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016, 4) DenseNet-201 (Huang et al., 
2017).  The  fully  connected  block  is  adjusted  to  feed  off  the  feature 
vector and output the ten species of leaves. Table 3 describe architecture

model. These methods plot a point cloud, where the density denotes the 
input space relevance. Thus, a higher density in a region suggests that 
the network ponderates it the most when classifying.

Inception,  and  DenseNet)  for  plant  species  classification  and  disease 
detection. Qian et al. (2020) monitor invasive plant species in the wild 
by  fine-tuned  models  (Alexnet,  VGG,  and  GoogLeNet).  Chulif  et  al. 
(2019) classify 10,000 plant species by using pre-trained InceptionNet 
models. Kaya et al. (2019) analyze deeply the effect of four different TL 
models on four publicly leaf datasets. (Barr´e et al., 2017) visualize that 
the  first  convolution  layers  learn  to  extract  leaf  venations  and  edges, 
while deeper layers derive high-level feature abstractions.

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as its deep learning model. This is mentioned in the beginning of section 4.2, stating that CNNs stand out among Deep Learning techniques due to their ability to disentangle high-level representations across multiple processing layers. Furthermore, the text explains how CNNs process data on two levels: a convolutional block for automatic feature extraction, and fully connected layers to establish feature-output correlation. Four pre-trained models are compared within the pipeline: AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201.
