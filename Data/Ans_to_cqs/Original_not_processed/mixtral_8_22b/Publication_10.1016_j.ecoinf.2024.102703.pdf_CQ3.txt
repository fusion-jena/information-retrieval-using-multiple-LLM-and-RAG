Spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes: 
Identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Study area 

The Erhai watershed is located in Dali Prefecture, Yunnan Province, 
China, It includes Lake Erhai (EH), Lake Cibi (CBH), Lake Xihu (XH) as 
well  as  the  Luoshi,  Yong’an,  and  Miju  Rivers.  The  main  lake  of  the 
watershed is Lake Erhai, the second-largest lake in southwestern China, 
which has an average depth of 10.5 m and covers an area of 249.8 km2. 
The Erhai watershed contains 117 rivers and streams, including the Miju 
River, Yong’an River, and Luoshi River, and lakes such as Lake Erhai, 
Lake Cibi, and Lake Xihu. In the northern part of Lake Erhai, Lake Cibi, 
and Lake Xihu are respectively fed by rivers including the Miju River, 
Luoshi River, and Yong’an River before flowing into Lake Erhai. Lake 
Cibi and Lake Xihu are the sources of Lake Erhai and are smaller in size. 
The expansion of tourists and residential pollution present problems for 
the western portion of Lake Erhai. 

2.2. Field sampling and sample collection

creases. This study implies that DOM absorption and humification can 
be used to predict the nutrient status of lakes and rivers in a plateau.

varying nutrient levels in the Erhai watershed. It also investigates the 
correlation between optical parameters of DOM and eutrophication and 
develops a faster and more thorough approach to comprehending the 
eutrophication status of plateau lakes based on optical characteristics.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears there might be some confusion regarding the topic of discussion. The context provided discusses spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes and identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China. However, the query asks about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Since this information isn't covered within the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer. Nevertheless, here's a brief overview of common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects in images or videos to identify their location. It's commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike semantic segmentation which groups pixels belonging to the same class together, instance segmentation identifies each distinct object in an image separately.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to its enclosing object or region.

4. Polygon Annotation: Used when objects have irregular shapes. Annotators draw polygons around these objects to mark them accurately.

5. Key Point Annotation: Also known as landmark annotation, it involves placing dots on specific parts of an object to capture its shape and contour.

6. Image Classification: Images are categorized into predefined classes. For example, cats vs dogs, apples vs oranges etc.

7. Text Annotation: Mainly used for NLP tasks where text needs to be tagged with relevant labels.
