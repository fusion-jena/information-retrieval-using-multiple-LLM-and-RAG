considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research.

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model mentioned here is being used for the purpose of predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water. This is evident from several references to studies that use various machine learning and deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict DO concentrations.

For instance, Areerachakul et al. (2013) integrated unsupervised and supervised neural networks to predict DO concentrations in canals. Similarly, Ay and Kisi (2012) employed different neural network techniques to model DO concentrations in Foundation Creek, while Arora and Keshari (2021) utilized Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models to estimate DO levels in the Yamuna River. Furthermore, Heddam et al. (2022b) developed a novel approach using LSTM deep learning to forecast DO concentrations in rivers.

Moreover, the context mentions that Chen et al. (2020) considered parameters like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in the air as input variables for their model, which suggests that this particular deep learning model might be designed to account for environmental factors affecting DO concentrations.

Therefore, based on the information available, we can infer that the primary objective of the deep learning model discussed in the context is to accurately predict or estimate DO concentrations in water bodies, taking into consideration relevant environmental factors.
