Ensemble deep learning models

• EfficientNetB0 EfficientNet is a CNN architecture and scaling method 
that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. EfficientNetB0 (Tan 
and Le, 2019) is a network that is trained on more than a million 
images from the ImageNet database.  

• EfficientNetB3 

EfficientNetB3 (Tan and Le, 2019) is another network of the Effi-
cientNet  family.  EfficientNetB3  comes  from  scaling  EfficientNetB0 
which was generated using AutoML.  

• InceptionResNetv2 

InceptionResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) is a CNN network that 
builds on the inception family of architectures. However, the model 
incorporates residual connections instead of the filter concatenation 
stage of the inception family.  

• ResNet50v2 

(Gomez et al., 2017) ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture that 
is  50  layers  deep.  ResNet50v2  is  also  trained  on  a  million  images 
from the ImageNet dataset.

diseases. We also propose using different ensembles to increase classi-
fication accuracy. To this end, five different deep-learning models are 
proposed to classify plant diseases. The chosen models are:  

Precision = TP

TP + FP

• DenseNet201 

• Recall 

(2)    

DenseNet is a network proposed by (Huang et al., 2017). In this 
network,  each  Layer  has  a  connection  with  subsequent  Layers. 
Densenet201 is a CNN that has 201 deep layers.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the use of various deep learning models such as EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, ResNet50v2, and DenseNet201 for plant disease classification. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository is located based solely on the given context.
