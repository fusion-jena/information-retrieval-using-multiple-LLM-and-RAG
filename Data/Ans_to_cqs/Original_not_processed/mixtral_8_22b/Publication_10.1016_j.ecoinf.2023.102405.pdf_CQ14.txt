%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I do not have enough context to determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search.
