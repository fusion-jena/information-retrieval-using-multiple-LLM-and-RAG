This study has certain limitations. Since the amount of data publicly 
provided  by  the HWSD  was small, and  the fact  that the  geographical 
detector required a large size of geographic samples (Feng et al., 2021). 
In future research on soil degradation, data from the Basic Soil Property 
Dataset  of  High-resolution  China  Soil  Information  Grids  (Feng  and 
Ganlin, 2021) and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve tem-
poral and spatial accuracy. Moreover, vegetation degradation (Wu et al., 
2022) and soil degradation research should be combined to establish a 
long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in 
HN. 

5. Conclusions

aggregate structure (Ahmad et al., 2017). Thus, it is crucial to continue 
reducing the frequency of anthropogenic disturbance in forests, such as 
by  reducing  the  magnitude  and  frequency  of  LUCCs  (e.g.,  rapid  con-
struction of residential areas and transport infrastructure) and gradually 
increasing protection for natural areas and mature forests, especially in 
the central areas of HN.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help mitigate the impact of random factors, such as the choice of initial weights or the order of training examples, on model performance and results interpretation.

Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the authors have utilized deep learning techniques in their studies related to ecosystem services, land degradation, deforestation, and soil degradation. However, there is no explicit mention of how they handled randomness within their deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details regarding this topic based solely on the provided information.
