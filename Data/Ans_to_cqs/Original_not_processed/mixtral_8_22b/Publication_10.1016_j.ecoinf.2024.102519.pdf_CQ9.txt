(1)  In 2020, the ESA within the WRB covered approximately 43.362 
× 103 km2, comprising 32.38% of the entire area. This included 
mainly forest (89.3%) as well as grassland, and a small amount of 

farmland. In terms of spatial distribution, the source areas were 
predominantly  located  in  the  northern  foothills  of  the  Qinling 
Mountains in the southern part of the basin, in the Ziwu Moun-
tains between the Jing and Luo Rivers in the central part of the 
basin, and in the Huanglong Mountain area east of the Luo River.  
(2)  Fifty optimal ecological source regions were obtained using the 
GA,  generating  122  ECs  that  were  40.24  × 105  km  in  length, 
which could disperse the entire WRB. These were distributed in a 
circular pattern within the watershed.  

(3)  The ESA and EC before and after optimization were compared. 
The  GA  was  applicable  and  reliable  in  identifying  the  optimal 
ESA, providing a reliable approach for constructing a regional ES.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the datasets used in this study are sourced from various organizations such as Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, and National Catalog Service for Geographic Information. However, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given information. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more details regarding the availability of their deep learning pipeline data repository.
