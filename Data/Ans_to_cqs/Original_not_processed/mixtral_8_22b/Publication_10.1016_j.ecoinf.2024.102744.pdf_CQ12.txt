feature  images  while  retaining  crucial  features.  The  Dropout  layer  is  integrated  to  mitigate 

overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input 

for the fully connected layer. This layer also facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by 

the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted 

class for the original image

CNN architecture but  with  different  filter sizes.  The obtained  results depend on the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and the number of filters in convolution layers. The higher the number of 

hidden layers, filter size, and filters, the higher the accuracy of classification. In [29], the authors 

proposed  four  different  models  for  bee  image  classification,  serving  different  tasks  in  beehive 

monitoring. All these models were based on different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have 

been  pre-trained  on  the  ImageNet  dataset  [30]  including  AlexNet,  DenseNet-201,  GoogLeNet, 

ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, VGG-19. In the first model, the authors used a transfer learning 

method based on these pre-trained DNNs. Meanwhile, in the second, third, and fourth models, the 

authors used the SVM classifier with deep features, shallow features, and deep+shallow features

image for each model in our experiments are computed and shown in Table 6.

iterations.  Each  iteration  involves  training  the  model  on  a  batch  of  images.  The  fundamental 

parameters for Faster RCNN training mirror those of YOLOv5. 

For evaluating the performance of the object detection models, we used a server equipped 

with  an  Intel(R)  Xeon(R)  CPU  E5-2620  v2  @  2.10GHz  (16GB  DDR3-1066  memory)  and  an 

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU (11GB GDDR5X memory). The Intersection over Union 

(IoU) threshold was set to 0.5, and the confidence threshold was also set to 0.5.

As detailed in the Related Work section, the PollenDataset was initially introduced in [18]. The 

images comprising this dataset were captured at the entrance of a bee colony in June 2017 at the 

Bee facility of the Gurabo Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico. This 

dataset encompasses 714 honey bee bounding boxes, consisting of 369 bee images with pollen

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions several types of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19. However, the main focus seems to be on CNN architectures. Specifically, the table shows various layers of a CNN architecture, including convolution, pooling, dropout, global average pooling, and dense layers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline primarily uses a CNN model for its operations.
