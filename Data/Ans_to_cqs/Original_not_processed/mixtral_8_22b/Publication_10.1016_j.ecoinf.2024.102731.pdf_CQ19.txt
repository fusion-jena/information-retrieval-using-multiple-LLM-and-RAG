Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on which specific frameworks were used to build a deep learning model. The context includes various land use categories such as urban areas, sparse vegetation, croplands, mosaics of different types of vegetation, and tree covers. It also mentions several research papers on topics like empty urbanism, habitat factors related to wildlife conservation, and habitat suitability models. However, none of these sources explicitly mention any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
