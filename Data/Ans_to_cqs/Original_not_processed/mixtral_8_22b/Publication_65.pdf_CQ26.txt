model that adjusts too well to the training data, but it does not generalize to the unseen
before dataset, i.e., a test dataset), after 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced
following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. Aside from this,
we used rotation, noise, and ﬂip (as in [50]) for data augmentation, and we were capable
of augmenting the dataset by six times. With the data augmentation technique, we can
make the CNN classiﬁcation more robust and generalize better. In Figure 9, we can see the
schematic diagram for the evaluation process.

All deep learning-based models exploited in this work were implemented using the
TensorFlow [51], a Python framework conceived to allow efﬁcient analysis and implemen-
tation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). All experiments conducted
here were performed on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory,
and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a 10.0 CUDA version. Debian
4.195.98-1 version was used as the operating system.

2.2.2. Evaluation Metrics

DeepLabV3+: The DeepLabV3+ [48] starts with three blocks composed of two convo-
lutions and one polling layer that performs the feature extraction and an initial prediction
map. These features are then processed by a particular layer, called Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling (ASPP) introduced in [49]. This technique involves employing atrous convolution
in parallel to extract features at multiple scales and alleviate the loss of spatial information
due to prior pooling or convolutions with striding operations. The data is then processed
with features extracted from the ﬁrst pooling layer and reﬁned by one extra convolutional
layer. Then three convolutional layers process the concatenated segments upsampled
by a bilinear interpolation producing the ﬁnal prediction map. For more details, see
Figure 7 [48].

The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text mentions the use of data augmentation techniques like rotation, noise, and flip to increase the size of the dataset by six times. Data augmentation helps improve the robustness and generalization of the CNN classification model. It should also be noted that the learning rate was adjusted using an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler after 50,000 iterations to prevent overfitting and ensure better generalization to unseen datasets.
