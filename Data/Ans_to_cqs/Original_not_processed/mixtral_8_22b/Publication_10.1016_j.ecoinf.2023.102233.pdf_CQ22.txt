Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

3.1. CNN model development with active learning 

The CNN model performance stabilised within five active learning 
iterations (Fig. 4). The majority of model performance improvement was 
achieved within the first two iterations, with a 34.3% decrease in macro- 
averaged MAE between iterations one and three, compared to a 12.1% 
decrease in macro-averaged MAE between iterations three and the final 
model (Fig. 4). Most of the training data added between iterations one 
and  three  consisted  of  non-target  calls  (Table  1),  which  led  to  rapid 
improvements in the model’s ability to differentiate non-target sounds, 
resulting in a reduction in false positives.

100 target calls. To overcome this challenge, we applied a random se-
lection  approach  that  was  stratified  across  the  model’s  predictions 
(logits).  While  this  approach  substantially  reduced  class  imbalance 
within our evaluation data and allowed for the calculation of reliable 
evaluation  metrics  (Raeder  et  al.,  2012),  the  nature  of  this  approach 
alters  the  distribution  of  data  and  prohibits  evaluation  metrics  being 
generalised  to  the  unlabelled  data.  Additional  research  is  needed  to 
investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced 
and unlabelled test data.

Helpful Answer:

In the given context, it is mentioned that the CNN model performance was evaluated using macro-averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This metric was used to measure the difference between the predicted values and actual values, providing insights into the overall performance of the model. However, due to the class imbalance issue in the evaluation data, a random selection approach was employed that was stratified across the model's predictions (logits). This approach helped reduce class imbalance but altered the distribution of data, making it difficult to generalize evaluation metrics to the unlabelled data. Therefore, additional research is required to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data. It should be noted that other common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
