WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs.

techniques may enhance classification performance.

Furthermore,  the  comparison  between  recording  months  provides 
valuable insights into the tradeoffs  associated with dataset size  selec-
tion. The superior performance of the WT-HMM in the 8 to 20-h dataset 
size  range  for  both  months  suggests  the  most  suitable  range  for 
achieving  high  accuracy.  This  finding  resonates  with  studies  empha-
sizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective 
model training (Kahl et al., 2021).

Sequel to training the two HMMs independently, HMM1 and HMM2 
are combined to form an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture 
weights. One of the HMMs is represented by the first 1–4 states, and the 
other  HMM  is  represented  by  the  following  5–8  states.  Specifically, 
states 1–4 depict the waveform of blue whale vocalizations while states 
5–8  represent  the  noise  signal.  Subsequently,  the  feature  vectors 
extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian 
parameters to produce refined feature vectors. The V-alg employs these 
refined feature vectors, along with T  and π, to classify the test dataset as 
either blue whale vocalizations or noise. It is noteworthy that that the V- 
alg switches from states 1–4 to states 5–8 with equal transition proba-
bilities. Table 1 shows the parameters used for WT-HMM simulation.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation must have taken place since the text mentions extracting feature vectors from the test datasets and updating them using trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors. These processes could involve various preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning to ensure optimal performance during the training phase. Nevertheless, without more detailed information on the exact methods employed, it would be speculative to state definitively which preprocessing steps were utilized in this particular case.
