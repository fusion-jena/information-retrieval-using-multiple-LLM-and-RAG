Machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has evolved into
the most commonly used approaches for the automatic classiﬁcation of
digital images (LeCun et al., 2015). The major advantage of deep
learning is that the time-consuming and complex step of previous fea-
ture extraction becomes unnecessary. Instead, the model learns and
extracts the relevant features itself during the training process. The
major drawback of deep learning is that large amounts of labeled
training data are required (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks
(CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to
extract spatial features. CNNs have proven to be quite powerful in
performing diﬀerent tasks such as object detection (Everingham et al.,
2010; Tompson et al., 2014), classiﬁcation (Traore et al., 2018, Xu
et al., 2017, Amara et al., 2017, Lu et al., 2017, Han et al., 2018) and

Although the use of pre-trained models has proven to be advanta-
geous for many image recognition tasks (Weiss et al., 2016), we decided
to train the model from scratch. We recognized that our speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation problem was too diﬀerent from the pre-trained networks.
Moreover, we considered the number of labeled samples available
(nearly 30,000 per class) as large enough for training our own network.

We trained the CNN using ReLU activation for the convolutional layers
and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected
layer (Clevert et al., 2015). As optimizer we chose the adaptive ADAM
(Adaptive Moment Estimation) with a learning rate of lr = 0.0001.
Training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations
(= 90 epochs).

CNNs are composed of three main components: convolutional

Fig. 4. Illustration of the CNN architecture and the classiﬁcation process. The network was trained with manually labeled samples with a tile size of 50 × 50 pixel.
The trained classiﬁer was then applied on whole repeat photographs, which were also split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. The classiﬁer predicts the output for each single
tile and reassembles them to the original image size.

The second set of photographs was used for testing the model per-
formance on new and more realistic data. When whole images needs to
be classiﬁed with CNN, there arise two problems. First, classical CNNs
assign only a single category on the input data and do not provide a
classiﬁcation with distinct boundaries. Second, the CNN takes only a

ﬁxed input size. To overcome these limitations, we split each photo-
graph into 50 × 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples.
Before splitting, all photographs were resized to a maximum width of
2500 pixels to reduce computing time.

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is image classification. Specifically, it aims to automatically classify digital images based on their content. This is achieved through the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for image analysis due to its ability to extract spatial features. The model is trained to distinguish between different classes of objects or elements within the images, such as woody vegetation versus other types of land cover like grass, soil, buildings, humans, animals, sky, water, stones, and asphalt. The ultimate goal is to apply this trained classifier to whole images, where it will predict the output for each individual tile and then reassemble them back into the original image size.
