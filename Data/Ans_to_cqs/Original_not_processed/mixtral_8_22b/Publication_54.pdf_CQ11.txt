Y.-P. Huang, H. Basanta: Recognition of Endemic Bird Species Using Deep Learning Models

acquired while learning the 27 endemic bird species should be
used to solve related tasks pertaining to the 29 endemic bird
species. Otherwise, considerable time would be spent every
time a new dataset of birds is used. Therefore, to implement
the entire process, we adopted a deep-learning-based model
(Inception-ResNet-v2) to train and learn the features of 27
endemic bird species (source domain). Then, the learned fea-
tures were transferred to a second target network to train the
newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain).
Thus, the problem was deﬁned as follows: for a given source
domain DS and learning task LT and target domain DT
and learning task TL, the transfer learning technique helps
improve the learning of the target predictive function fT (·)
in DT using the knowledge acquired from DS and LT , where
DS (cid:54)= DT or LT (cid:54)= TL [25], [26]. Transfer learning method
enables to utilize knowledge from previously learned tasks

A. ACCURACY COMPARISONS OF BENCHMARK
NETWORK MODELS
Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy
and practicability of the proposed method. For the quantita-
tive analysis of the models, we ﬁrst compared state-of-the-art
deep learning backbone models, such as Inception-ResNet-
v2 [27], Inception-v3 [28], Xception [32], ResNet101 [29],
and MobileNetV2 [33]. Fig. 5 lists the classiﬁcation accura-
cies achieved by the learning models.

Inception-ResNet-v2 was found to consistently outperform
the other existing learning networks by attaining 100% train-
ing accuracy, 97.47% validation accuracy, and 97.11% test
accuracy.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the authors used a deep-learning-based model called Inception-ResNet-v2 to train and learn the features of 27 endemic bird species (source domain), which were then transferred to a second target network to train the newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain). The paper also compares the classification accuracies achieved by different learning models but does not provide any links to data repositories containing the datasets used in their study.
