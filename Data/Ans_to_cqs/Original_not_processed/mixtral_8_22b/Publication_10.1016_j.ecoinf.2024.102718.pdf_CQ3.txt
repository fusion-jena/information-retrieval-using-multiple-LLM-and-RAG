Additionally, S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. proposed the CAHA-
AXRNet approach, a novel rice plant disease detection method opti-
mizing hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hum-
mingbird algorithm. This approach achieved an accuracy rate of 98.1%
when evaluating three types of disease detection datasets, namely the
rice plant dataset, rice leaf dataset, and rice disease dataset (Sankar-
eshwaran et al., 2023). M. Sharma et al. introduced a novel structure
called DeepBatch, which utilized deep learning-based segmentation
with bitwise logical and operation to diagnose rice-infected leaves. This
approach demonstrated a substantial enhancement in performance
when compared to traditional methods, particularly in the identification
of rice diseases (Sharma et al., 2023b).

H. Yang et al. proposed the dense higher-level composition detection
transformer (DHLC-DETR) specifically for identifying rice diseases. The

dataset is being used to obtain the pretraining weights for our proposed
model. After augmenting the dataset, the number of images increased to
185,431 with 38 classes.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or classification was performed due to the mention of various datasets containing different types of rice diseases. Additionally, the use of deep learning-based segmentation mentioned in one of the studies suggests that instance segmentation might have been applied. Instance segmentation involves outlining each object of interest within an image, allowing the model to identify individual instances of objects rather than treating them as part of a larger group. Nevertheless, without more detailed information on the exact steps taken during the data preparation phase, it cannot be definitively stated what specific data annotation techniques were used.
