Evaluation on Simulated Data Sets
DEPP training and parameter sensitivity.—We start by
evaluating DEPP on simulated data sets, testing the
ability to train the CNN model in reasonable times. As
the training epochs advance, the loss function (1) drops
rapidly and stabilizes after around 500 epochs in a typical
case (Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material available on
Dryad). Here, training, which is a one-time process for
each reference tree, ﬁnished in around 20 min for the 200-
taxon data set and 260 minutes for 10,000-taxon data set,
on a machine with one 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU
cores. Placement of 1000 queries took 4 seconds for the
200-taxon and 30 s for the 10,000-taxon data sets using a
single CPU core. On the small 200-taxon data set, EPA-ng
has an advantage in terms of running time. However, in
the larger HGT data set (10,000-taxon), DEPP placements
are faster than the alternatives with half the running time
of EPA-ng. In terms of the memory usage, APPLES+JC

Placement.—Once the CNN model is trained, we use it to
map a given query sequence q to a vector of distances
D1 ...Dn. For data sets with missing data (gaps), we
compute two sets of distances,
1,
using the models with and without gap reconstruction,
respectively. The ﬁnal distances is set to the weighted
i , where �
sum of the distances, that is, (1
is the proportion of the sites with gaps in the query
sequences. The weighted sum is used to reduce the
impact of reconstructed bases (which are guessed, as
opposed to being observed) on the ﬁnal distance and
will be empirically tested. Given these distances, we then
place q onto T using distance-based placement (Balaban
et al. 2020), which uses dynamic programming to ﬁnd the
dqi(T))2,
placement with the minimum
where dqi(T) represents the tree-based distance between
(cid:30)
the query and each taxon i (Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are some implicit indications regarding optimization techniques used during the training phase. One strategy mentioned is the use of a running average of the recent magnitude of the gradient to speed up training, known as momentum (Tieleman and Hinton 2012). This technique helps smooth out the fluctuations caused by individual gradients and can improve convergence rates. Additionally, the authors mention checking the training loss every 50 epochs and stopping the training when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. They also select the model with the optimal objective function value. These practices contribute to ensuring stable and efficient training, although they do not directly address managing randomness from sources like random seed values or other stochastic elements in the deep learning pipeline.
