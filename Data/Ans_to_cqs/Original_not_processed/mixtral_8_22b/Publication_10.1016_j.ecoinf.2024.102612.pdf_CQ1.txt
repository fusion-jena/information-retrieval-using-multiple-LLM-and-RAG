different formats to achieve the best performance when leveraging MS data.

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3.

The NN takes a collection of N points as input, where each point is 
represented  by  its  coordinates  and  two  spectral  reflectance  values  at 
distinct wavelengths, and outputs a vector with the indices of each point 
in  the  collection  and  another  vector  with  their  semantic  scores.  To 
facilitate  further  processing,  the  point  set  underwent  voxelisation, 
transforming the points into sparse volumetric grids. These grids serve 
as the input for a U-Net-style backbone, enabling the extraction of point 
features.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the study utilizes Multispectral LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data for training a Deep Learning (DL) model. However, the specific methods or tools used for collecting the raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

In general, LiDAR data can be collected using airborne or terrestrial LiDAR systems. Airborne LiDAR involves mounting the system on an aircraft or drone, while terrestrial LiDAR requires placing the sensor on the ground. Both methods involve emitting laser pulses towards the target area and measuring the time it takes for the pulse to return after reflection, which allows for accurate distance measurements.

As for the spectral reflectance values mentioned in the context, they could potentially be obtained through hyperspectral imaging techniques. Hyperspectral cameras capture images across numerous narrow bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, providing detailed information about the materials being imaged.

However, without more specific details regarding the data collection process in this particular study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or consult the original research paper for more precise information.
