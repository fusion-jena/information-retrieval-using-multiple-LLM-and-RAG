Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do provide some insights into potential methods based on their research focus. For instance, Simonis (2020) conducted a passive acoustic survey of deep-diving odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem, which suggests that acoustic sensors or hydrophones could be used for data collection. Similarly, Soldevilla et al. (2008) studied the classification of Risso’s and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks, indicating the use of audio recordings for data collection. Additionally, Simons & John (2022) reference ERDDAP, a data server that provides access to environmental data from satellites, buoys, and other sources, suggesting that satellite imagery or remote sensing data might also be relevant. Lastly, ct.org/web/packages/PAMpal/index.html appears to be a software package for analyzing passive acoustic monitoring data, further supporting the idea that acoustic data is commonly collected for this type of research. Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, it can be inferred that various types of sensor data, such as acoustic and remote sensing data, are likely used.
