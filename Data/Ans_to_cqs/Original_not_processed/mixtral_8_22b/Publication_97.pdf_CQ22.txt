To tune the architecture of the neural network, we tested the following combinations of parameters
(Algorithm A1, line #24), which correspond to diﬀerent U-Net architectures: num_layers = {64, 32, 16},
depth = {2, 3, 4}, layer_rate = {2, 1.5, 1.2}, batch_norm = {True, False}, residual = {True, False}, dropout
= {0, 0.5}. Thus, we performed a grid search over 216 diﬀerent U-Net-like architectures and found
several of the best ones which are suitable for forest damage segmentation.

All of the best results corresponded to the conﬁguration when the number of layers was equal to
64, and dropout was applied. The best one, whereby an additional batch normalization is applied,
corresponds to the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm =
True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.

The neural network performance was assessed by means of overall accuracy score and the mean
value of intersection over union (MeanIoU), as was implemented in Hamdi et al. [39]. The latter
is widely used in semantic segmentation because it allows for the handling of class-imbalanced
cases, which are common when dealing with pixel-wise classiﬁcation problems. The algorithm of
computation of the MeanIoU metric was the following [39]: 1) MeanIoU values were computed using
the MeanIoU function from the Keras package for each threshold value in the interval [0.5, 1) with a step
of 0.05; 2) all these values were stored in the array, and ﬁnal average value of MeanIoU was computed.
The overall accuracy score was computed as a fraction of correctly classiﬁed pixels and their

total number.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the U-Net-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using two primary metrics: Overall Accuracy Score and Mean Intersection over Union (MeanIoU).

The Overall Accuracy Score is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. This provides a measure of how well the model can accurately predict the correct class for each pixel in the image.

On the other hand, Mean IoU is a more robust evaluation metric, especially useful in cases of class imbalance, which is often encountered in pixel-wise classification tasks like this one. It measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segments, providing a better understanding of the quality of the segmentation produced by the model. To compute Mean IoU, firstly, Mean IoU values are calculated for different threshold levels ranging from 0.5 to 1 with a step size of 0.05 using the MeanIoU function from the Keras library. These values are then averaged to obtain the final Mean IoU score.

These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model in performing accurate forest damage segmentation.
