Deep learning only works well with lots of labeled data, sig-
niﬁcant computational resources, and modern neural network
architectures. Here, we combine the millions of labeled data
from the SS project, modern supercomputing, and state-of-
the-art deep neural network (DNN) architectures to test how
well deep learning can automate information extraction from
camera-trap images. We ﬁnd that the system is both able to
perform as well as teams of human volunteers on a large frac-
tion of the data and identiﬁes the few images that require
human evaluation. The net result is a system that dramatically
improves our ability to automatically extract valuable knowledge
from camera-trap images. Like every method, deep learning has
biases (discussed below) that must be kept in mind, corrected,
and/or accounted for when using this technology. Swanson et
al., 2016 (14) showed that the citizen-scientist approach also has
its own set of systematic biases, but that they can be adequately

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that various data formats have been employed in different studies. For instance, reference [23] discusses sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks, which could involve text or time series data. Reference [25] focuses on deep residual learning for image recognition, indicating the use of image data. Similarly, reference [26] mentions very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, further emphasizing the use of image data. References [20], [21], and [22] pertain to speech recognition, suggesting the utilization of audio data. Lastly, reference [46] introduces ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, reinforcing the application of image data in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in the mentioned deep learning pipeline remain unknown, it is evident that various formats such as text, time series, image, and audio data have been utilized in similar contexts.
