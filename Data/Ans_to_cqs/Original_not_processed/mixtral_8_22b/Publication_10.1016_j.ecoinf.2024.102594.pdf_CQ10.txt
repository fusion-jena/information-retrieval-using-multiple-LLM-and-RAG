DeepLabV3+ algorithm was developed by the PyTorch (1.12.1) li-
brary,  using  the  Python  (3.9)  programming  language  in  the  present 
investigation. Xception was chosen as the backbone network (Li et al., 
2022),  and  dilated  convolutions  with  different  dilation  rates  were 
employed for feature extraction. The selected loss function was Cross-
EntropyLoss with an initial learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 4, and 
epochs  of  150  (Zhang  et  al.,  2022).  In  selecting  the  optimizer  and 
learning rate adjustment strategies, this study compared the SGD and 
Adam algorithms and experimented approach with various strategies, 
including  StepLR,  CosineAnnealingLR,  and  ReduceLROnPlateau. 
Finally, it was found that utilizing Adam in combination with Reduc-
eLROnPlateau could accelerate the convergence rate of model training 
and effectively reduce the risk of overfitting. The operating principle of

3.1. DeepLabV3+ algorithm 

DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation, which 
is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family (Scepanovic et al., 
2021).  In  the  encoding  stage,  DeepLabV3+ introduces  dilated  convo-
lutions,  which expands  the  receptive field  without losing information 
(Fig.  3).  The  Atrous  spatial  pyramid  pooling  module  with  dilated 
convolution  has  been  mainly  designed  to  appropriately  incorporate 
multi-scale information. During decoding, it is capable of enhancing the 
accuracy  of  segmentation  boundaries  by  further  integrating  low-level 
features with high-level features (Liu et al., 2021a).
