Abstract: Fish is one of the most extensive distributed organisms in the world. Fish taxonomy
is an important component of biodiversity and the basis of ﬁshery resources management. The
DNA barcode based on a short sequence fragment is a valuable molecular tool for ﬁsh classiﬁcation.
However, the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of
ﬁsh species make it difﬁcult to reasonably analyze the DNA sequences and correctly classify ﬁsh
from different families. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic
Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), named ESK model. In
stage one, the ESK preprocesses original data from DNA barcode sequences. In stage two, EN-SAE is
used to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each ﬁsh. In stage three, KDE is
used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify ﬁsh from different families. The

Another considerable experimental result is that Elastic Net can improve the perfor-
mance of the proposed model. A good deep learning model usually requires abundant
data to train and analyze, while the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of ﬁsh
species from different families and the problem of overﬁtting in small datasets are more
and more serious. To solve the overﬁtting problem in training process on small datasets
is of great importance. In our study, Elastic Net is used to solve overﬁtting problem and
improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Moreover, genetic characteristics
of species belong to high-dimensional data, which are time consuming during training.
However, directly combining a set of fully connected EN-SAE is often has little effect for
extracting useful information. Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save
training time. Therefore, Elastic Net can improve the performance of proposed model.

Deep learning, a method for learning and extracting useful representations from
raw data, training model, and then using the model to make predictions, has made great
progress in recent years [36]. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method using
DNA barcode sequences through deep learning model to classify ﬁsh from different families
and determine which ﬁsh are regarded as outgroups, called ESK model. First, the method
aligns DNA sequences to obtain the sequences with the same length, then, converts them
into numerical data by using one-hot encoding. Second, the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked
Autoencoder (EN-SAE) to learn data features and obtains an outgroup score of each object.
Finally, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to generate a threshold and predict which
ﬁsh are outgroups base on the threshold. To verify the effectiveness of ESK model, three
families with a large number of species and obvious interspeciﬁc variation are selected as

As shown in Tables 4–6, the AE has the shortest running time and the poorest clas-
siﬁcation results compared with the other two models. The AE consists of only a single
Autoencoder, but only one Autoencoder cannot learn the deep features of DNA barcode se-
quences well, resulting in poor classiﬁcation results compared with deep learning methods.
Although the ESK time consumption is longer than AE, the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score
improved for all datasets, by 8.44%, 8.77%, and 4.84%, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of DNA barcode sequences as input data for the deep learning model. DNA barcode sequences are typically obtained through laboratory techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of specific gene regions. These techniques involve extracting DNA from fish tissue samples and then targeting and amplifying specific genes or gene regions that serve as unique identifiers for different fish species. Once these DNA sequences have been generated, they can be processed and converted into numerical data suitable for analysis by the deep learning model.
