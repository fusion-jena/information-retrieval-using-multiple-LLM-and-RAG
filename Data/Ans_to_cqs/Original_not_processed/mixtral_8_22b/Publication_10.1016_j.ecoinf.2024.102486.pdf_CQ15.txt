the  proportion  of  articles  using  GPU  computing  rose  rapidly  from 
approximately 1% in 2016 and 2017 to 12–15% in 2021–2023. By far 
the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine 
learning  where  the  training  phase  can  readily  be  parallelised  and 
accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does discuss various libraries and frameworks commonly used for deep learning tasks, including TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. These libraries often include built-in support for popular optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and others. For instance, TensorFlow provides a wide range of optimizers, including SGD, Adam, and more advanced ones like AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Nadam. Similarly, Keras offers several optimizer classes, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. PyTorch also supports multiple optimization methods, including SGD, Adam, and other variants. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query, it implies that these libraries enable users to apply various optimization techniques in their deep learning pipelines.
