Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The tables presented provide various metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. These include overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Overall accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified pixels out of all pixels. Producer's accuracy measures how well the model identifies positive cases (iceplant), while user's accuracy indicates the probability that a pixel classified as positive actually belongs to the positive class. TP represents the number of correctly identified positive instances, FP denotes incorrectly identified positive instances, TN signifies correctly identified negative instances, and FN stands for incorrectly identified negative instances.
