Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Therefore, the data normalization stage is unnecessary.

This research utilizes six organoleptic parameters and applies them 
to seven fish species, serving as the standard for automatically classi-
fying fish freshness. The dataset, generated over 11 days, is employed in 
machine learning experiments. In the clustering process, we exclusively 
consider Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. 
However, alternative distance metrics have not been explored, poten-
tially  influencing  the  quality  of  freshness  class  determination.  Future 
research possibilities may involve investigating the impact of different 
distance metrics on class groups. Each distance possesses distinct char-
acteristics,  leading  to  varied  cluster  patterns.  Additionally,  extending 
this work to include other fish species could provide a more compre-
hensive understanding.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of the training set and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data.
