3.2. Random forest model 

According to the parameter optimization results of the random forest 
(RF)  model,  five  training  samples  were  analyzed,  whose  importance 
scores (VI) were obtained by simulation, and the selected variables were 
sorted according to their scores. The results are shown in Fig. 3, in which 
the VI plots for the five samples are consistent; the scores of the selected 
10 variables were more than 20% VI, and showed a threshold of 30% VI, 
above which the variables assumed higher importance (Fig. 3). In the 
training  and  test  datasets,  the  intermediate  models  established  by  RF 
showed that the proportion of explained variance was between 91% and 
92%  (Table  4).  Further,  the  correlation  coefficients  between  the

the average VI between all samples was calculated, and an average VI of 
30% or higher was selected for the final model (Table 4).

RMSE between the measured and fitting values is 146.202 and 117.430 
ion/cm3, and  the  linear correlation  R2  is  0.275 and  0.980,  indicating 
that the RF model has high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect. 
In addition, to further verify the model’s stability, independent test data 
were used in the RF model for 10-fold cross-validation, and the results 
are shown in Table 5. For that test, the average R2  was 0.931 and the 
average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, reaffirming that the RF model has 
high simulation accuracy and good stability.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the evaluation metrics used for the Random Forest (RF) model are not typical deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, the performance of the RF model is evaluated using different measures.

For instance, the Variable Importance (VI) score is used to determine the significance of each input feature in predicting the output. A threshold of 30% VI is set, above which variables assume higher importance. This helps identify the most influential features in the dataset.

Additionally, the percentage of explained variance is used to assess how well the model explains the variability in the target variable. In this case, the intermediate models established by RF show that the proportion of explained variance is between 91% and 92%.

Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values is employed to gauge the strength and direction of the relationship between them. All samples exhibit correlation coefficients above 0.95, suggesting a strong positive association.

Lastly, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R^2 are utilized during the 10-fold cross-validation process to quantify the difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower RMSE and higher R^2 indicate better model performance. On average, the RMSE is 141.124 ion/cm3, and the R^2 is 0.931, demonstrating the high simulation accuracy and good stability of the RF model.
