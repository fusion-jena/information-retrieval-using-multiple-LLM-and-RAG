Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

The most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting
image   features   is   the   Convolutional   Neural   Network   (CNN)   (LeCun   and   Bengio   1995).
A convolutional neural network extracts the features of an image by passing through a
series of convolutional, non-linear, pooling (image downsampling) layers and passes them
to a fully connected layer to obtain the desired output. Each convolutional layer extracts the
visual features of the image by applying convolution operations to the image with kernels,
using a local receptive field, to produce feature maps and passing it as input to the next
layer. The initial layers in the network compute primitive features on the image, such as
corners   and   edges,   the   deeper   layers   use   these   features   to   compute   more   complex
features consisting  of curves and  basic  shapes  and  the   deepest   layers  combine  these

The   model   was   implemented   with   the   Detectron2   (Wu   et   al.   2019)   library   in   PyTorch
framework and trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of
0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network (see
section above on network architecture) had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
(square root of area in absolute pixels) each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The
thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0.6 for training and 0.25 for testing,
respectively.

Helpful Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model described in this text is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given context, we can infer that its primary function is object detection. This conclusion is drawn from several key points mentioned throughout the passage. Firstly, the authors discuss the application of deep learning techniques to identify species and higher taxa from digitized herbarium sheets, which suggests that the model aims to recognize specific objects within images. Secondly, the paper mentions the implementation of the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework, which is specifically designed for object detection tasks. Lastly, the description of the model's configuration includes details about the anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network, thresholds for non-maximum suppression, and the use of stochastic gradient descent optimizer – all of which are commonly associated with object detection models. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model may not be directly stated, it appears that its main objective is to detect and classify various plant organs present in digitized herbarium scans.
