Sustainable natural resources management relies on effective and timely assessment of conservation and land 
management practices. Using satellite imagery for Earth observation has become essential for monitoring land 
cover/land use (LCLU) changes and identifying critical areas for conserving biodiversity. Remote Sensing (RS) 
datasets  are  often  quite  large  and require  tremendous  computing power  to  process.  The  emergence  of  cloud- 
based  computing  techniques  presents  a  powerful  avenue  to  overcome  computing  limitations  by  allowing 
machine-learning algorithms to process and analyze large RS datasets on the cloud. Our study aimed to classify 
LCLU for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five 
spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Optimization of the DNN

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository is located based solely on these sources. It would be necessary to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly to obtain this specific information.
