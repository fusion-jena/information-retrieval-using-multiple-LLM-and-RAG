torelli et al., 2014). Most machine learning approaches are not designed 
to handle training data that is not ‘pure’ or 100% representative of the 
target invader (Roberts et al., 1998).

MTMI-SMF is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be 
due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching 
with  image  pixels.  MTMI-SMF  groups  pixels  surrounding  a  training 
location  that  could  have  invader.  Most  other  machine  learning  algo-
rithms require a single pixel to represent a training location, which often 
leaves the user making an educated guess on which pixel best represents 
that training location. Here, we compare MTMI-SMF classification (i.e., 
confidence values with a threshold applied) to a commonly used ma-
chine learning classification approach, random forest.

the guesswork out of developing a training dataset by including a group 
of pixels around a field site and knowing that the ‘truth’ is included in 
one of those pixels. Lastly, MTMI-SMF is computationally very efficient 
compared  to  most  machine-learning  algorithms  because  it  relies  on 
simple matrix multiplication.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some aspects related to preparing data for machine learning models. For instance, it talks about handling 'imperfect' data due to locational errors or mismatches between training locations and image pixels. It also mentions how MTMI-SMF handles this issue by grouping pixels surrounding a training location, rather than requiring a single pixel to represent a training location. This approach reduces the need for guesswork when developing a training dataset. Additionally, the text notes that MTMI-SMF is computationally efficient compared to many machine learning algorithms because it uses simple matrix multiplication. But again, these points do not directly address the specific preprocessing steps typically involved before training a deep learning model.
