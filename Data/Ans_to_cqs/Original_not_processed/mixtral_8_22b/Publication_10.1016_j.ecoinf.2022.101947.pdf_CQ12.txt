Trails  were  collected  from  free-ranging  Amur  tiger,  of  unknown 
identity, at the study sites. Table 2 reports the trail ID collected for each 
trail. As described above (Section 3.1) sub-trails were formed where >10 
footprints existed in any one trail. For example, the table indicates that 
using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, we were able to derive 
four sub-trails. Section 3.5 below explains how the sex classification for 
images and the resulting designations for each trail were made. 

3.3. Data validation to determine the optimal size for algorithm training 
and test sets

3.4. Algorithm training using data from captive Amur tigers 

A  classification  dendrogram  was  generated  using  the  FIT  pairwise 
comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). The process was iterated multiple times by altering elements 
within  the  model  to  generate  the  fewest  misclassifications  (Li  et  al., 
2018). The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers giving 
100%  accuracy.  This  algorithm  was  then  used  to  classify  the  free-

mean of the predicted test set size diverges from the actual test set size. 
Optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size 
was smallest relative to the training set. However, even when the test to 
training set  ratio  was  32:12, the  predicted value  was  close  to the  ex-
pected value, demonstrating the robustness of the model.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions a "classification dendrogram" being generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. Therefore, it cannot be determined if a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was used.
