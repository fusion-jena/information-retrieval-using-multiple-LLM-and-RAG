Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In this study we have made a general approach, without performing 
specific  searches.  That  is,  we  have  searched  for  expressions  such  as 
“what is this”, “anyone knows” and “I have found” (with their different 
forms of expression and co-official languages in the Spanish territory). 
We have not employed a dictionary of predefined words, such as “tur-
tle”, “fish”, “shark”, “dolphin”, “jellyfish”, “Velella” or “starfish”, among 
others,  which  would  undoubtedly  have  considerably  increased  the 
number of reported observations. We attempted not to influence a priori 
the searches, avoiding bias in certain categories. Any improvement and 
development  of  the  algorithm  must  therefore  consider  the  use  of  a 
specific dictionary. This is essential if monitoring a certain species or 
thread, such as in the case of sea turtle entanglements by marine debris. 
Faced  with  this  problem,  protocols  have  previously  been  created  to

In this study we have used the ‘Full-archive search endpoint’ to ac-
cess  the  entire  dataset  published  on  Twitter  from  its  beginning  in 
2006–2007 until the end of 2022. To handle the data in JSON format 
returned  by  the  Twitter  API,  we  used  the  twarc2  library  (https:// 
twarc-project.readthedocs.io/).  This  library  simplifies  the  handling  of 
the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API, as well as the pagination 
resulting from a single query. 

The API works by searching for words, hashtags or combinations of 
both  in  the  text  of  tweets,  much  like  the  Twitter  Advanced  Search 
interface  (https://twitter.com/search-advanced?).  To  find  out  how  to 
run the search, in an initial phase of the study, some public tweets with 
observations  were  provided  by  the  social  media  manager  of  the

DIVERSIMAR project (@diversimar). This helped us to understand how 
users expressed themselves in this social network. Although many of the 
tweets turned out to be very specific, it was possible to identify three 
fairly common ways of expressing that something interesting had been 
found. Therefore, we decided to perform the tweet search through the 
API  with  three  different  criteria:  (i)  tweets  in  which  users  ask  “who 
knows” or if “anyone knows” what they have found (query 1), (ii) tweets 
that directly ask “what is this” that they have found (query 2) and (iii) 
tweets  from  users  claiming  to  have  found  something,  with  textual 
expression as “I/we have found” (query 3). Different verb tenses were 
also used in each of the expressions, as well as the use of first person in 
both  singular  and  plural.  In  addition,  the  different  criteria  must  be 
accompanied by one of the following words to ensure that they refer to

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about the optimization of hyperparameters of any machine learning models used in the study. It only mentions the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach but does not discuss the optimization process of LDA hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
