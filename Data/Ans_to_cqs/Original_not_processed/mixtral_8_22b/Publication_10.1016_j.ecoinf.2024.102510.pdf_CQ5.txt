bird image data is also a challenge, as deep learning algorithms require 
large amounts of labeled data to train effectively. The lighting condi-
tions, weather, and other environmental factors present in the image can 
also impact the appearance of birds, adding complexity to recognition. 
The dataset used to train a deep learning model may not represent the 
bird population in the wild, leading to bias and potentially impacting the 
accuracy of the model.

networks  experienced  overfitting,  failing  to  generalize  effectively. 
Several  data  augmentation  techniques  were  employed  to  address  this 
issue.  Data  augmentation  expands  a  dataset  by  applying  trans-
formations, such as flipping, translation, and shear, to the existing data 
(Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Data augmentation helps maintain 
dataset balance, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of 
deep learning models (Mungloo-Dilmohamud et al., 2022). In this study, 
horizontal and vertical translations were done within a range of (cid:0) 30 to 
30 pixels, allowing random shifts. Shear distortion was applied within a 
range of (cid:0) 5 to 5, representing maximum distortion to the left and right. 
Table 3 details the transformations used for data augmentation on the 
selected  dataset.  After  augmentation,  the  training  dataset  size  was 
increased from 11,788 to 40,000 images. After the data augmentation,

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context use several datasets for bird species identification. These include:

1. A dataset consisting of 83 bird species native to Indonesia with 8057 images. This dataset achieved an accuracy of 88.07%. However, it requires further testing on different deep learning models and development of methods for live bird detection in images.

2. Another dataset contains 31,320 images of 29 bird species but its description is noted as being inaccurate. It achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98.39%.

3. The CUB-200-2011 dataset, which includes 11,788 images of 200 bird species, has been used twice in the given context. In one instance, it achieved accuracies of 85.70% and 82.10%, while in another, it reached 87.60% and 89.50%.

4. There is mention of a dataset containing 1000 images of three bird species, though no specific name or source is provided.

These datasets serve as the foundation for developing and improving deep learning models for bird species identification. They provide the necessary input for these models to learn patterns and features associated with each bird species, enabling accurate identification even when faced with challenges like varying lighting conditions, weather, and other environmental factors.
