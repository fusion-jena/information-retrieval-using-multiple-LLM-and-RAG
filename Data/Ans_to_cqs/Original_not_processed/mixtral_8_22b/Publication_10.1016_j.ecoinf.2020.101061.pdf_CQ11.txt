2.2. Deep learning

We used our previously developed algorithm for RGB-based tree
identiﬁcation, which was used at a single site (Weinstein et al., 2019).

beyond the NEON sites may be useful for many applied problems. It is
currently unknown to what extent features learned from the 0.1 m re-
solution data used here can be applied to lower resolution satellite data
(Karlson et al., 2014) or higher resolution UAV data (Brieger et al.,
2019). Cross resolution training has not been fully explored in en-
vironmental remote sensing, but Li et al. (2018) recently showed that
deep learning networks can learn scale invariant land classiﬁcations
that can be matched among data sources. Given the ability to collect
virtually unlimited pretraining data using our data generation ap-
proach, NEON sites can be seen as an ideal training sources for RGB tree
models that could then be applied to other data types.

Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by the authors. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based solely on this text. To find the relevant links, one would need additional information or access to the original research paper or its supplementary materials.
