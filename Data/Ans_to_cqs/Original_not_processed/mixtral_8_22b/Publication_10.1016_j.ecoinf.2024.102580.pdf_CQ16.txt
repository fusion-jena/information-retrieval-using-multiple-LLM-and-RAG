size of the imagery dataset includes the training, validation and test images (e. 
g., size 10 includes 6 training, 2 validation and 2 test ground-truth images).

The ground-truth dataset was divided randomly into training (80%), 
validation (10%), and test (10%) sets (Fig. 1), this division of the im-
agery allowed for a good-sized validation and test dataset for evaluating 
the  model’s  accuracy,  while  maximizing  the  training  set.  During  the 
training process, each image was subset and cropped into 6 overlapping 
patches  matching  the  output  size  of  the  network  (388  × 388  pixels), 
resulting  in  a  total  training  set  size  of  379  images.  In  addition,  data

augmentation  techniques  were  used  to  artificially  create  a  larger 
training  set  by  randomly  flipping  each  input  image  horizontally  and 
vertically with a probability of 0.5 each and rotating the images by up to 
180
.  Weighted  cross-entropy  was  used  as  the  loss  function  and  the 
stochastic  gradient  descent  optimization  algorithm  was  used  to  mini-
mize the loss function. The model accuracy was assessed after each full 
training set iteration (epoch), quantifying the proportion of correct class 
predictions out of the total predictions made. Precision was determined 
as  the  ratio  of  correct  predictions  to  the  total  number  of  predictions, 
encompassing both false and accurate ones. Recall, on the other hand, 
measured the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of pixels 
that should be assigned to that specific class.

Helpful Answer:

The model accuracy was assessed after each full training set iteration (epoch), quantifying the proportion of correct class predictions out of the total predictions made. This suggests that the completion of training may have been determined based on the performance of the model on the validation set after each epoch. Additionally, Fig. 3 shows the overall training loss curve for the ground-truthed training and validation sets, indicating that the training loss decreased over time, which could also suggest that the completion of training was determined based on the convergence of the training loss. However, it is not explicitly stated what specific criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
