Our   work   highlights   the   importance   of   proper   metadata   curation   when   approaching   a
machine learning project. Assembling the training dataset for the mercury analysis required
many person   hours   to   visually   inspect   images   for   staining,   whereas   clubmoss   and
spikemoss images were easily compiled using specimen metadata alone. Nascent eﬀorts
in digitization in NHCs must carefully consider the acquisition and curation of metadata
because it aﬀects how quickly machine learning tools can be applied to digitized museum
collections.

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. In this study, the authors might have employed similar strategies, but without further details, we cannot confirm which specific criterion they used.
