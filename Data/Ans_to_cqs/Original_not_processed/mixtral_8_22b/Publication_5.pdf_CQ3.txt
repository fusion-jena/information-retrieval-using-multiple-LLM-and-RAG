The training process was performed for a number of iterations in which all the training
data were exposed to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value. The
model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA
Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the
computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.

Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in many scientiﬁc applica-
tions [67,68] but do not always guarantee better outcomes [69,70]. Therefore, we compared
the performance of the proposed DL model with a RF regression model as a baseline, since
RF showed reasonable results and is popular in various machine learning applications [71].
To determine the best values of the hyperparameters (number of trees, maximum tree
depths, and the maximum number of features) in the RF model, a grid search was used.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image or video frame. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In this technique, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This is often used for scene understanding tasks such as autonomous driving.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation also assigns a class label to each pixel. However, it goes one step further by differentiating between instances of the same class. For example, if there are two cars in an image, they will be labeled differently even though they belong to the same class.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves tracing the outline of objects in an image with a polygon. It is useful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object. It is often used for facial recognition tasks where key points like eyes, nose, mouth etc. need to be identified.

6. Key Point Annotation: Similar to landmark annotation, key point annotation involves identifying specific points on an object. However, these points may not necessarily correspond to physical features of the object. They could represent abstract concepts instead.

Again, please note that the above mentioned techniques are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
