ering larger datasets. Also in this case, larger R2 values are found when 
considering L < 500.

To extract meaningful information for the purpose of our study, the 
delineation  of  the  skyline  has  to  be  highly  detailed.  The  detection  of 
edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry 
as the loss of effective spatial resolution associated with the learning of 
contextual  information  by  the  net  diminishes  high-frequency  details 
(Hariharan et al., 2015; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We address this prob-
lem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and 
Koltun,  2011).  The  ability  to  capture  fine  details  with  a  CRF 

compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate 
precisely delineated objects. 

To  measure  the  increase  in  detail  of  the  skyline  using  CRF,  we 
calculated the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and 
evaluated the gain length as:

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of instances in the minority and majority classes, respectively. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. These techniques can help balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help prevent bias towards certain groups or characteristics.

Without more context, it is difficult to determine which technique would be most appropriate for addressing data bias in the given scenario.
