options, contribute to the stability of the search. Additionally, its effi-
cient standard marking system can remove low-quality pixels, thereby 
improving  search  quality  (Li  et  al.,  2023a,  2023b,  2023c,  2023d). 
However, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to 
obtain high-quality Rrs  retrieval, and the complex aerosols of PL make 
this practice less efficient.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used based on the available information.
