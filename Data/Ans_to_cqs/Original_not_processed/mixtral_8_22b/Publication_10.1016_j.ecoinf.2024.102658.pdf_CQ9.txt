the  data  is  difficult  and  costly  to  collect.  This  poses  a  bottleneck  for 
building SDMs for practical use.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data and codes created in the research are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. Additionally, there is an interactive map available at <https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=> for informally exploring all outputs of models. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that the data and codes are available on GitHub.
