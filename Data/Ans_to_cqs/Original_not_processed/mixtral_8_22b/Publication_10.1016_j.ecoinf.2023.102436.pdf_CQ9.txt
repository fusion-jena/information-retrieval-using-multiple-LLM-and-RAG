reduction reaching as low as (cid:0) 0.632 compared to the baseline. The most 
prominent disparity is observed in the boundary region, particularly in 
proximity  to  nearby  buildings.  The  Iteration  II  (Fig.  7c)  focuses  on 
increasing the density of trees to improve the restorative potential. Since 
the western and southern parts of the park already have sufficient tree 
cover, our primary focus is to intensify tree plantation in the northern, 
eastern,  and central  areas while aligning  with the  size  and  species of 
existing trees. The change resulted in slight improvements (Fig. 7h) in 
the restorative potential, particularly in the central areas. Iteration III 
(Fig. 7d) replaces some vegetation with water in the central area due to 
the park’s lack of water landscape. The results (Fig. 7i) also indicate a 
negligible impact, with the maximum difference from the baseline being 
just 0.05.

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline used in the research is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does state that the data will be made available upon request. Therefore, if more detailed information about the data repository is required, one should contact the authors or refer to the full text of the paper.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, but I cannot provide the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research as it is not specified in the given context.
