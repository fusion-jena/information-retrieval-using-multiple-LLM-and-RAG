The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

(in terms of comparative presence–absence item counts), Accuracy is a
suitable measure for model performance evaluation. Nevertheless, all
applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to
best), for reasons to be explained in Section 4.1.1 below.

3.2.5. K-nearest neighbors

It is an non-parametric ‘lazy’ learning algorithm. This means that it
does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and
that it does not use the training data points to do any generalization. It
does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply
stores instances of the training data. Classiﬁcation is computed from a
simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query
point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives
within the nearest neighbors of the point.

3.2.6. Decision tree

The Decision Tree Classiﬁer is a simple and widely used classiﬁca-
tion technique. It applies a straightforward idea to solve the classiﬁ-
cation problem by posing a series of carefully crafted questions about
the attributes of the test record. Each time it receives an answer, a
follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the class label of
the record is reached.

where TP is the number of true (correct) positive (presence) predic-
tions, TN is the number of correct negative (absence) predictions, FP is
the number of false positive predictions and FN is the number of false
negative predictions.

Other metrics used are Precision, Recall, and the F-measure.
Precision is deﬁned as the fraction of relevant/correct instances among
the retrieved instances for a class, while Recall is the fraction of re-
levant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of

relevant instances. In terms of the same counts used above, they can be

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: The trained models need to be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, etc. These metrics help assess the performance of the models and compare them against other models or baselines. For example, in this case, the authors evaluate their models using stratified cross-validation and report the results in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. They also explain why accuracy might not be a suitable metric due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

2. Visualizing Results: Another important aspect of postprocessing involves visualizing the results obtained from the models. This could involve generating saliency maps, confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc. These visualizations provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models and help identify areas where improvements can be made. However, there is no mention of these types of visualizations being generated in this particular study.

3. Parameter Tuning: Postprocessing often includes fine-tuning the parameters of the models to improve their performance further. This could involve adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization strength, batch size, etc. Again, there is no explicit mention of parameter tuning being carried out in this study.

In summary, some possible postprocessing steps after model training include evaluating the models using appropriate metrics, visualizing the results, and fine-tuning the parameters. However, the exact set of postprocessing steps will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project.
