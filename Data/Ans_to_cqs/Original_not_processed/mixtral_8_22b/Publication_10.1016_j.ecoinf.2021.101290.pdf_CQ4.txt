Leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intel-
ligence for automated annotation and analysis especially requires high 
quality data (Egnor and Branson, 2016). Although automated annota-
tion is widely applied, it is mostly used offline which has the advantage 
that the researcher can assist the algorithms, fine tune parameters and 
oversee that classifications are correct. However, it also limits the op-
tions for data collection and closed loop experimentation. We instead 
propose  to  automatically  annotate  and  analyse  data  online  while  the

A topic that we did not discuss in this paper is edge computing (Davis 
et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2016), essentially meaning to process data before 
sending it  on the network and  thus improve  response times  and  save 
bandwidth. This requires processing power close to the sensor, which we 
have, but we used it to stream data to the network and not to reduce the 
amount of data to transmit. However, a reduction does happen at the 
edge of the cluster where data streams are transformed to event streams 
and  could  thus  also  happen  at  the  sensor,  given  sufficient  processing 
power for the task. An important advantage of reducing the amount of 
data  is  that  data  can  be  transferred  from  remote  locations  via  low 
bandwidth solutions, such as LoRa (a long range, low-power, wide area 
network modulation technique) or Starlink (satellite based internet ac-
cess). Although the architecture and online computational ethology in

The tools and methods available for event-stream processing are not 
the focus of this paper but they are increasingly many. Most have been 
developed  for  e-commerce,  monitoring  of  financial  markets  and  IT 
system monitoring but could as well be applied in biology. AWS kinesis 
(Amazon, 2011) and Apache Kibana (Elastic, 2016) give access to state 
of the art machine learning methods for event-stream processing at a 
click  and  mature  querying  languages,  such  as  elasticsearch  (Elastic, 
2012) make advanced data mining available to a much broader group of 
users.

Helpful Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer using only the information given. However, I can share some general knowledge about these common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Data augmentation is a strategy employed to increase the diversity of training datasets without collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of images in the dataset through various transformations like:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to create new variations. Horizontal flips are more commonly used since they often preserve the object's label.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by different angles to generate new samples. This helps the model learn features invariant to orientation changes.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to simulate objects appearing closer or farther away. This helps the model recognize objects regardless of their size in the image.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along the x and y axes to mimic small movements of the camera or object. This encourages the model to identify features irrespective of their position within the frame.

5. Shearing: Applying shear transformation distorts the shape of objects in the image, helping the model understand deformations.

6. Noise injection: Adding random noise to the pixels of an image can help the model become robust against noisy inputs.

These techniques allow models to better generalize and perform well on unseen data. Keep in mind that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the problem domain and the nature of the input data.
