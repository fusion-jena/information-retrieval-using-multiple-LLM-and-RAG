2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

Random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression). The results show that canopy 
conditions and airborne LiDAR point densities did not affect the strength of the AGB model, but that model's 
strength was affected by the vegetation regeneration component in the field biomass reference and by the ma-
chine  learning  method  tested  for  modelling.  AdaBoost  and  random  decision  forest  were  the  most  successful 
methods. To evaluate the quality of an AGB model it is recommended to combine several individual evaluation 
functions into the model score. The study highlights several recommendations to follow when estimating AGB 
from ALS using an ABA in Central European forests.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be suggested:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is to fix the random seed value before running experiments or training models. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs, ensuring reproducibility.

2. Multiple Runs: Another way to manage randomness is to run multiple iterations of the experiment or training process with different random seeds. This helps capture the variability introduced by random initialization and provides more robust performance estimates.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness by averaging out the performance across different subsets of the dataset.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random initializations can also improve overall performance and mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging and boosting fall under this category.

While these strategies are generally applicable, specific approaches may vary depending on the problem domain and available resources.
