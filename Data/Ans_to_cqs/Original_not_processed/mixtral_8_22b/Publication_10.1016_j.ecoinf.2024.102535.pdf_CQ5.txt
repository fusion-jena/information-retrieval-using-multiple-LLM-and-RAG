Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The batch size was 32, and the early stopping procedure was used to 
avoid over-fitting. The patience parameter, which controls the number 
of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, was set to 10. 
Each network, with a particular architecture and considering a specific 
substratum characterization, was trained and executed three times, each 
time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters 
and with a different data fold. As already mentioned, the results shown 
in  the  next  section  are  averages  of  those  three  executions.  Data 
augmentation was applied to all extracted patches: a 90âˆ˜  rotation and 
vertical and horizontal flips. 

4.4. Performance metrics

The increasing availability of seabed images has created new opportunities and challenges for monitoring and 
better  understanding  the  spatial  distribution  of  fauna  and  substrata.  To  date,  however,  deep-sea  substratum 
classification relies mostly on visual interpretation, which is costly, time-consuming, and prone to human bias or 
error. Motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks in learning semantically rich representations 
directly from images, this work investigates the application of state-of-the-art network architectures, originally 
employed in the classification of non-seabed images, for the task of hydrothermal vent substrata image classi-
fication.  In  assessing  their  potential,  we  conduct  a  study  on  the  generalization,  complementarity  and  human 
interpretability aspects of those architectures. Specifically, we independently trained deep learning models with

Motivated  by  the  scenario  described  above,  this  work  investigates 
deep learning-based techniques for substratum classification in hydro-
thermal vent environments. Hydrothermal vents are high-temperature 
fluid  emissions  that  arise  on  the  seafloor  and  that  sustain  unique 
faunal  communities.  Our  main  goals  are  to  reduce  the  human  effort 
involved  in  substratum  characterization;  alleviate  the  subjectivity 
inherent to human photo interpretation; and contribute to reduce the 
costs and time involved in monitoring the deep sea. 

With  those  purposes  in  mind,  we  devised  a  DL-based  solution  for 
automatically labeling deep-sea images, which employs different CNN 
architectures and allows human photo interpreters to audit the DL-based 
predictions,  considering  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  complete  image 
dataset.

The selected CNNs typically contain an encoder stage, often called a 
feature  extractor,  which  reduces  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  input 
through convolution and pooling operations in consecutive layers. The 
encoder is then followed by fully connected layers of neurons that pre-
dict the input image class based on the previously extracted features to 
perform image classification. 

After  briefly  introducing  the  chosen  CNN  architectures,  we  will 
discuss the decision fusion process. That process is based on a decision 
committee  that collects  the  predictions  of the  respective  CNN-trained 
models.  We  will  also  explain  uncertainty  assessment  based  on  model 
predictions.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the exact dataset(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of seabed images, specifically related to hydrothermal vent environments, since the goal is to perform substratum classification in these areas. Additionally, the text mentions that the performance metrics were designed to address the challenges of monitoring and better understanding the spatial distribution of fauna and substrata in the deep sea. Therefore, while I cannot provide the name of the dataset(s), they likely consist of labeled seabed images relevant to hydrothermal vent environments.
