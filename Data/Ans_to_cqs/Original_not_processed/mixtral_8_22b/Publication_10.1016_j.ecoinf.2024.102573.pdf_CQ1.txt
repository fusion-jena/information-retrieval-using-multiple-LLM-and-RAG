datasets.  They  are  not  flexible  enough  to  address  current  open  chal-
lenges unless used purposefully on a narrow task.

This  experiment  used  both  learnable  frontends  with  80  filters  of 
length  512  (16 ms)  that were  initialized  by  mel-filterbanks.  Gaussian 
pooling  was  removed,  and  downsampling  happened  in  the  filtering 
convolution layer by a stride of 320 (10 ms). Then, the outputs were log- 
compressed  without  normalization.  These  plain  frontends  are  called 
LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and Table 4 shows their test results.

It  seems  to  require  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  each  species’  fre-
quency  niche  to  create  optimal  individualized  features.  Yet,  the  most 
celebrated capability of deep neural networks is automatic and task(s)- 
relevant feature extraction while doing the classification task(s) jointly, 
which  has  led  to  unprecedented  achievements  (LeCun  et  al.,  2015). 
Hence, one could ask whether to consider a time-frequency represen-
tation or the waveform as raw input to neural networks to capture all the 
relevant information from bird vocalization. Although the former is the 
prevalent  approach,  data  processing  inequality  indicates  that  post- 
processing can not increase a signal’s information (Beaudry and Ren-
ner,  2011).  Therefore,  the  waveform  is  a  promising  alternative  to 
traditional features derived from it when leveraging neural networks.

Recent years have seen impressive progress in bird species recogni-
tion and related tasks (Stowell, 2022; Xie et al., 2023). It was foreseeable 
that  deep  learning  would  emerge  as  the  most  successful  method  for 
large-scale  bioacoustics  analysis  (Kahl  et  al.,  2021;  Stowell,  2022; 
Stowell et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zsebok et al., 
2019). The main advantage of neural networks is to avoid many brittle 
and  difficult  choices  in  designing  manual  features  for  the  underlying 
task. For example, Xie et al. (Xie and Zhu, 2019) compared three types of 
features  for  bird  species  classification  consisting  of  hand-crafted 
acoustic features, including features from Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-
efficient (MFCC), visual features extracted from the Constant-Q Trans-
form (CQT) time-frequency representation, and training a convolutional 
network directly on the CQT. They also tested the fusion of classifiers

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning applications, we can infer some possible ways of gathering raw data for this domain.

In the field of bird species recognition using deep learning, researchers often rely on audio recordings of bird sounds collected through various means. Some common sources include:

1. Public Datasets: Researchers may use publicly available datasets containing pre-recorded bird sound samples. Examples of these datasets include BirdCLEF (Joly et al., 2017), iBird (Liu et al., 2016), and Warblr (Sparks et al., 2017). These datasets usually contain labeled bird vocalizations, which can be useful for supervised learning tasks like bird species identification.

2. Surveys: Field biologists conduct acoustic surveys to collect bird sound recordings. This involves capturing bird calls and songs using specialized equipment like microphones and digital recorders. These surveys can take place in different habitats and seasons to gather diverse bird vocalizations.

3. Sensors: Automatic recording units (ARUs) equipped with sensitive microphones can be deployed in the wild to continuously monitor bird activity. ARUs can capture high-quality bird sound recordings over extended periods, providing large volumes of data for deep learning models.

While the given context does not explicitly mention any of these methods, they represent commonly employed techniques for gathering raw data in similar domains.
