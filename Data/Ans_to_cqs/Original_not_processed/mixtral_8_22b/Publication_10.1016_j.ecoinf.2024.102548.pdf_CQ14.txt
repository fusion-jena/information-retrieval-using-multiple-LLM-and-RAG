Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

5.1.4. Total model parameters 

Total  parameters  in  a  neural  network encompass  the  aggregate of 
trainable weights and biases, serving as a direct measure of the model’s 
architectural complexity. This parameter count is pivotal in defining the 
model’s capacity for feature extraction and pattern recognition. High- 
parameter  models  are  adept  at  discerning  intricate  data  patterns  but 
are  susceptible  to  overfitting,  particularly  in  scenarios  with  limited 
training samples. Furthermore, such models escalate computational and 
memory  requirements,  potentially  impeding  deployment  in  resource- 
constrained environments.

4.3. Parameter setting 

The experiments were performed using GPU acceleration to expedite 
computations.  The  models  were  initialized  with  pre-trained  weights 
obtained from the ‘imagenet’ dataset. To tailor the models to the specific

classification tasks. The evaluation of model performance was based on 
the  accuracy  metric.  Each  model  underwent  training  for  10  epochs, 
utilizing  a  batch  size  of  32.  The  class  mode  was  set  to  ‘categorical,’ 
indicating  that  the  labels  were  encoded  using  one-hot  encoding  for 
multi-class  classification  tasks.  These  generalized  parameter  settings 
were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and 
standardization throughout the study experiments.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights obtained from the 'imagenet' dataset and that they underwent training for 10 epochs utilizing a batch size of 32. However, it does not specify whether techniques like grid search or random search were used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
