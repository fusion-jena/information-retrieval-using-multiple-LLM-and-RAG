Abstract

1.  Digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big data-

sets and typically must be pre- processed prior to conducting analyses. One crucial 

image pre- processing step in any image analysis workflow is image segmentation, 

or the ability to clearly contrast the foreground target from the background noise 

in an image. This procedure is typically done manually, creating a potential bot-

tleneck for efforts to quantify biodiversity from image databases. Image segmen-

have  revealed  promising  utility  for  automating  data  collection  ap-

data  collection  increase.  Computer  vision  techniques  provide  one 

proaches for studies in ecology and evolutionary biology at substan-

means  for  accurate  and  scalable  image  pre- processing  in  biology 

tially greater speeds than manual approaches (Christin et al., 2019; 

(Lürig et al., 2021; Muñoz & Price, 2019; Porto & Voje, 2020).

Lürig et al., 2021; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2019). To 

Machine learning, and especially deep learning algorithms, which 

illustrate, deep learning with CNNs has been successful for ecologi-

permit  the  identification  and  classification  of  complex  patterns  in 

cal applications, including the automated identification of sea turtles 

noisy environments (Carranza- Rojas et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; 

(Gray et al., 2018) and segmentation of cetaceans (Gray et al., 2019)

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention or provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it mentions the name of the toolkit developed for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning - 'Sashimi'. Therefore, interested readers may search online platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for the 'Sashimi' toolkit to find its corresponding code repository.
