tanayak  et  al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  we  will  explore  knowledge 
distillation methods, which have been surveyed extensively and proven 
effective  in  model  compression  through  distillation  and  quantization 
(Gou  et  al.,  2021;  Polino  et  al.,  2018  preprint:  not  peer  reviewed). 
Through this comprehensive suite of improvements and optimizations, 
we aspire to develop lightweight yet powerful fish individual recogni-
tion algorithms, thereby providing robust technical support for intelli-
gent aquaculture and marine ecological protection initiatives.

Leveraging  transfer  learning  for  model  development,  their  approach 
exhibited  robustness  and  universal  applicability  after  training  on  a 
large-scale dataset. Specifically, the recognition accuracy for fish caught 
on the deck of a fishing vessel reached an impressive 96.24%. Rauf et al. 
(2019)  also  contributed  to  this  field  by  proposing  a  deep  learning 
framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition. The 
proposed CNN architecture comprises 32 deep layers, making it highly 
capable of extracting valuable and discriminative features from images. 
This framework provides a valuable reference for researchers in the field 
of fish species recognition. Furthermore, building upon the foundation 
of  underwater  individual  fish  recognition,  numerous  scholars  have 
delved  into  related  research  encompassing  fish  species  classification, 
behavior  analysis,  and  trajectory  tracking.  For  instance,  Rathi  et  al.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are several references to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), suggesting that they might be part of the pipeline. For example, Rauf et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition. Additionally, Spampinato et al. (2008) mentioned detecting, tracking, and counting fish in low-quality unconstrained underwater videos, which could involve CNNs or other types of models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal data processing. Lastly, Zhang et al. (2021) developed an underwater fish individual recognition method based on improved YOLOv4 and FaceNet, both of which use convolutional layers. Therefore, while the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline remains unknown, there are strong indications that CNNs play a significant role in various aspects of fish detection, tracking, and recognition tasks.
