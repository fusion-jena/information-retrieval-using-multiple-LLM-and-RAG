quires up-to-date information on where and how these species are using

FIT,  that  can  expand  non-invasive  survey  data  beyond  just  species 
presence/absence to sex identification, provide important new tools for 
the  study  of  wildlife  that can  have  immediate,  on-the-ground conser-
vation applications.

Collecting  data  on  rare  species  that  occur  over  large  areas  can  be 
logistically difficult and expensive, especially at a population scale. In 
such  circumstances  biologists  often  rely  on  non-invasive  sampling 
techniques  such  as  camera  traps,  acoustic  recorders,  non-invasive  ge-
netic  sampling  (scat,  hair,  urine,  feathers)  or  track  collection.  While 
these  methods  provide  a  cost-effective  option  for  species  detection, 
identifying sex can be challenging. For example, determining sex using 
non-invasive genetic samples can be cost-prohibitive, require access to a 
laboratory  for  analysis,  or  be  limited  by  DNA  quantity  and  quality. 
Methods  to  identify  individual  or  sex  from  camera  trap  images  have 
been developed for some species with unique pelage patterns (Rowland

habitat (Thompson et al., 2021). While this proxy is imperfect as not all 
females  reproduce  and  they  may  be  detected  outside  of  reproductive 
habitat,  it  has been  identified  as  the  best  available option  to  identify 
important  conservation  areas  population  wide  given  the  large  spatial 
extent and rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain any information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is located based on the given context alone. It would be necessary to consult additional sources or contact the authors directly to find out more about the availability and location of the code repository.
