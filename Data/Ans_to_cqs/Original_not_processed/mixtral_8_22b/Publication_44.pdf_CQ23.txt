kernel to expand without increasing the number of parameters [39]. This expansion of the
window is controlled by the dilation rate and it enables the network to capture information
from a larger receptive ﬁeld of view with the same parameters and computational complex-
ity as the normal convolution. The combination of spatial pyramid pooling with Atrous
convolutions resulted in an efﬁcient multi-scale processing module called Atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP). In the earlier version (DeepLabV3) [40], the last ResNet block of
the modiﬁed ResNet-101 uses different Atrous convolutions with different dilation rates.
ASPP, together with bilinear up sampling, is also used on top of the modiﬁed ResNet block.
DeepLabv3+ is an improvement in the previous version by adding an effective decoder
module to improve the boundaries of the segmentation results [41]. Furthermore, apart
from ResNet-101, an Xception model can be used as a feature extractor while applying a

threshold during training for 3000 iterations. At the end of the training process, the best
performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN
model with a NMS threshold of 0.7 during testing.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indicators suggesting potential strategies employed. For instance, the use of a modified ResNet-101 architecture and an Xception model as feature extractors implies the application of transfer learning, which leverages pretrained models to enhance the model's ability to generalize across various datasets. Additionally, the mention of using a diverse set of features such as extent, filled area, major axis length, minor axis length, perimeter, solidity, diameter, aspect ratio, rectangularity, compactness, circularity, narrow factor, per dia ratio, per length ratio, and per width ratio suggests that the model may have been trained on a diverse dataset. Lastly, the reference to saving the best performing model based on validation loss indicates the possible use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, these assumptions should be confirmed through further investigation or additional context.
