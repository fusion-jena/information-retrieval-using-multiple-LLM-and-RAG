their  convolutional  kernels  and  pooling  layers.  Regarding  this  issue, 
Zhang  et  al.  (2019)  incorporated  a  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM) 
network to develop a 3DCNN-LSTM model as a classifier, making the 
network more sensitive to the temporal changes in birdsong informa-
tion. It is important to note that the use of RNNs such as the CRNN model 
requires  more  computing  resources  for  training,  and  performance 
improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to 
addressing  the  limitations  of  CNNs  is  to  introduce  attention  mecha-
nisms.  For  example,  Soundception  (Sevilla  and  Glotin,  2017)  was 
developed  by  introducing  time  and  time-frequency  attention  mecha-
nisms to Inception V4; the resulting model achieved first place in the 
BirdCLEF  2017  Competition.  Fu  et  al.  (2023)  proposed  an  improved 
ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure and an

from data, thereby reducing the need for manual feature selection; such 
networks  have  demonstrated  considerable  potential.  The  mainstream 
deep  learning  approach  for  sound  recognition  involves  mapping  the 
sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified 
network  architecture  adapted  from  advanced  image  recognition  for 
automatic  feature  learning.  The  effectiveness  of  convolutional  neural 
networks  with  residual  connections  in  recognizing  bird  sounds  was 
demonstrated  in  the  annual  LifeCLEF  Bird  Identification  Challenge 
(BirdCLEF) competition (Kahl et al., 2021a, 2022, 2023).

We denote the mean of training the hierarchical framework proposed 
by Wang et al., 2021 using our attention-based Xception backbone as 
“LHT+”,  where  LHT  stands  for  label  hierarchy  transformation.  This 
framework  uses  specific  classification  headings  at  different  levels  to 
distinguish features of varying levels. Finer-level features contribute to 
predicting coarser-level labels through a label hierarchy transformation 
matrix. Our path correction strategy was also incorporated. To ensure a 
fair  comparison,  we  avoided  data  augmentation  in  all  models  and 
maintained consistent hyper-parameters and random seed settings.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the mainstream deep learning approach for sound recognition involves mapping the sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified network architecture adapted from advanced image recognition for automatic feature learning. This suggests that the data preprocessing step might involve transforming audio signals into spectrogram images, which could be considered a form of data annotation. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
