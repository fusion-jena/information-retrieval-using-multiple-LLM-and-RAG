Acknowledgements 

We would like to express our gratitude to all GIS data providers and 
open access sources, namely the Fairbanks Municipality. FH appreciates 
the help by the H. Berrios and E.J. Huettmann team, including Chrome 
et al. For LK, project no. TKP2021-NKTA-32 has been implemented with 
the  support  provided  from  the  National  Research,  Development  and 
Innovation  Fund  of  Hungary,  financed  under  the  TKP2021-NKTA 
funding scheme. This is EWHALE lab publication # 303.

information system (GIS) platform and then added 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U. 
S. Census data. We trained, tested, and evaluated the performance of an ensemble of machine learning models, 
resulting in predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots, at 100-m resolution for inference. We find that 
Short-billed Gulls prefer the synergy of industrial areas near man-made water bodies, impervious surfaces, gravel 
pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps) and some young forest vegetation. This study is a first-known 
attempt  to  utilize  a  blended  ‘Big  Data’  approach,  in  combination  with  traditional  multi-year  field-based data 
collection and alternative model assessments, in order to characterize an urban seabird niche. Our findings, and 
the digital infrastructure herein, provide an interdisciplinary baseline for potential applications in urban plan-
ning and monitoring the spread of disease reservoirs.
