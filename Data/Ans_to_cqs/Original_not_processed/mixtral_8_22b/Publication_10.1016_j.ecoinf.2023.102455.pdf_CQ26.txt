The last step in configuring the model involves feeding in predictors 
that  the  advanced  deep  learning  algorithm  feeds  by  the  decomposed 
components  resulting  from  the  previous  steps.  The  primary  model  is 
CNN-BiGRU  with  three  comparative  ML  methods  (KELM,  RVFL  and 
CNN-BiRNN),  which  provide  four  complementary  models  including 
MVMD-CNN-BiGRU,  MVMD-RVFL,  MVMD-KELM  and  MVMD-CNN- 
BiRNN.  These  models  are  used  to  create  the  multi-temporal  fore-
casting model of daily streamflow (Qflow). Setting hyperparameters and 
their structural architecture is the most important aspect of executing 
ML-based  predictive  models  (Jamei  et  al.,  2023b).  Based  on  recent 
research, the main approaches to tuning parameters are algorithms of 
metaheuristic optimization, schemes of cross-validation schemes (Nes-
ted/rolling  basis  cross-validation)  (Huyghues-Beaufond  et  al.,  2020),

The application of a pooling layer allows data compression and the 
removal of irrelevant data. In this particular case, the max-pooling layer

3.3. Machine learning tuning

the Qflow  data due to the inherent non-linear correlations between the 
associated variables (input and output parameters) during the simula-
tion.  Therefore,  conceptual  machine  learning  (ML)  and  data  pre- 
processing  methods  are  highly  recommended  and  considered  reliable 
tools  to  effectively  analyze  and  extract  the  non-linear  behaviours  be-
tween the predictor-predictand relationships (Liu et al., 2022; Yaseen 
et  al.,  2018).  For  instance,  data  pre-processing  methods  can  be  com-
bined with ML models at a prior stage of the learning process, where 
more  comprehensive  information  can  be  supplied  for  the  prediction/ 
forecasting matrix (Nourani et al., 2014). This integration increases the 
modeling  capability  of  a  standalone  prediction  model  used  for  Qflow 
modeling. 

Qflow data-based modeling is a strategy that brings an essential era to

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the use of data pre-processing methods combined with ML models to supply more comprehensive information for the prediction/forecasting matrix, increasing the modeling capability of a standalone prediction model used for Qflow modeling. It also mentions the importance of setting hyperparameters and their structural architecture when executing ML-based predictive models. Additionally, the context highlights the use of metaheuristic optimization algorithms and cross-validation schemes for parameter tuning. Nevertheless, without further context, it cannot be determined if these techniques were specifically applied to address data bias.
