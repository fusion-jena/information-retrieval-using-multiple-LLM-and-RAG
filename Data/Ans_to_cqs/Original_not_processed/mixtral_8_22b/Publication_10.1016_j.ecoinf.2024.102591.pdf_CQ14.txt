does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable, and is 
largely  computationally-efficient  in  GEE  (Belgiu  and  Dr˘agut¸,  2016; 
Breiman, 2001; Lary et al., 2016; Quintano et al., 2023; Roteta et al., 
2021). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were 
preserved,  except  for  the  number  of  trees,  which  was  set  to  500  to 
improve  computational  efficiency  without  losing  precision  in  the  BA 
estimates as determined by recursive validation of the BA classification 
algorithm over independent wildfires (see Section 3.1). We calculated 
the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) to assess RF variable impor-
tance on classification accuracy.

interest and for the official fire perimeters of the EFFIS database. The 
algorithm automatically selects the date range of interest for the pre- 
and post-fire scenes in the case of using an official perimeter from the 
EFFIS database. Otherwise, the date range can be manually selected by 
the user. The automatic search for pre- and post-fire scenes of acceptable 
quality can either be based on a single-date approach or on pixel-based 
temporal  mean  composites  as  determined  by  the  Sentinel  (QA60)  or 
Landsat (QA_PIXEL) quality assessment bands (see Section 2.2.1). When 
the  user requests the  calculation of a  spectral index in FIREMAP, the 
result is automatically displayed on the main screen as a continuous or 
categorized fire severity map, with the possibility of using user-defined 
thresholds.  The  latter  has  been  included  because  of  the  ecosystem- 
dependent  nature  of  the  relationships  between  the  CBI  and  spectral

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model used in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation were optimized. However, it mentions that the default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the Burned Area (BA) estimates. This adjustment was made after recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires. Therefore, it appears that the optimization process involved some form of recursive validation rather than traditional methods like grid search or random search.
