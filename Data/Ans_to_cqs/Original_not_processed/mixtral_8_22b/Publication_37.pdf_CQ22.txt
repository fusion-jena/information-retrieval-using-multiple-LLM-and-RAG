Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The  methods  compared  in  this  study  are  evaluated  in  terms  of 
classification  accuracy.  We  divide  the  CLO-43SD  dataset  into  5 
folds  and  perform 5-fold cross  validation,  and  report the  results  as 
a  box-plot  generated  from  the  per-fold  accuracies.  For  identfying 
the best training epoch for the CNN model we use  1 of the 4 training 
folds  as  a validation set, and train on the remaining 3 folds. 

4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The results for the MFCC baseline, SKM and CNN models are pro 
vided  in  Figure  1  (left  of the  dashed  line).  Mean  accuracies  are 
indicated  by  the  red  squares.  We  see  that  both  models  based  on

During training the model optimi zes cross-entropy loss via mini-
batch  stochastic  gradient descent  [26].  We  use  a constant learning 
rate  of 0.01  and  apply  dropout [27]  to  the  input of the  last two lay 
ers  with  probability 0.5.  L2-regularization  is  applied to  the  weights 
of the last two layers  with  a penalty  factor  of 0.001.  The  model  is 
trained for  100 epochs and is  checkpointed after each epoch.  A val 
idation  set  is  used to  identify  the  parameter setting  (epoch)  achiev 
ing the  highest classification accuracy.  The CNN is  implemented  in 
Python using Lasagne [28] , and data stream  multiplexing (for train 
ing)  is implemented using Pescador [29].

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using classification accuracy. The authors divided the CLO-43SD dataset into five folds and performed 5-fold cross-validation. They reported the results as a box plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. To determine the best training epoch for the CNN model, they used one of the four training folds as a validation set and trained on the remaining three folds. Therefore, the primary metric used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in this study is classification accuracy.
