During  the  MLPNN  training  phase,  initial  arbitrary  connection 
weights were assigned. Inputs were forward-fed from the input to the 
hidden  layer.  Hidden  neurons  multiplied  inputs  by  weights,  summed 
products,  and  processed  sums  through  a  transfer  function.  Results 
propagated  to  the  output  layer,  with  output  values  compared  to  ex-
pected  values  for  error  computation.  Iterative  error  back-propagation 
adjusted  connection  weights  until  reaching  a  target  minimal  error. 
The network then accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training 
and new input data without training data. This required tests to deter-
mine optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training it-
erations  (500).  The  trained  network  was  subsequently  used  for  feed- 
forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images or image data. Specifically, the research papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of hyperspectral images, multispectral images, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for various applications such as land cover classification, biomass estimation, and object detection. Additionally, some studies also utilize altitude data and other geospatial information. However, there is no mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in these pipelines. Therefore, based on the available context, we can conclude that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipelines discussed here is image data.
