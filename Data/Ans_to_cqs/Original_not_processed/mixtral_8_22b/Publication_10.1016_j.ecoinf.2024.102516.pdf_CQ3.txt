Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.2.3. Annotations

information usable as annotations for network training.

extract  plant  cover  information  without  training  on  actual  annotated 
plant cover data. 

2.3.1. Base network

In this phase the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute 
error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution 
(cid:0) 5. Moreover, we utilize 
of 1536 Ã— 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10
only horizontal flipping for data augmentation in this phase. 

2.5. Baseline comparison 

To also have a comparison of our method with a simpler approach, 
we compare our results with the ones from a ResNet50 that was pre- 
trained  on  the  ImageNet  classification  dataset  (Russakovsky  et  al., 
2015) with added FPN, later also referred to at ImageNet baseline model. 
As the ImageNet dataset is a normal classification dataset that does not 
contain the plant species from our dataset, this network cannot be uti-
lized  for  zero-shot  cover  prediction.  Hence,  we  only  evaluate  this 
network after training it on our dedicated plant cover data.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the network can extract plant cover information without being trained on actual annotated plant cover data. This suggests that some form of unsupervised or self-supervised learning might be employed. Additionally, the mention of a ResNet50 pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset implies that transfer learning could be utilized. Unfortunately, there is no direct reference to traditional data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation within the given context.
