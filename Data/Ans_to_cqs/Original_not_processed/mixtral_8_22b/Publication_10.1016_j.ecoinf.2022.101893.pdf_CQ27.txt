The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers 
to extract deep features. After the convolution pooling, the data enters 
the fully connected layer for connection. The network adds a dropout 
layer  to  the  fully  connected  layer  to  reduce  network  parameters.  A 
Dense_1 layer is added after flatten to reduce the dimension of the deep 
features, and sets the parameter to 500, which is the parameter of the 
deep feature dimension extracted from different views. 

4.2. Feature selection

In recent years, deep learning has an excellent performance and is 
also widely used in computer vision, speech recognition and other fields. 
Xie et al. used Chirplet transform, STFT and Mel cepstrum transform to 
obtain the spectrogram, and combined with the bird species recognition 
method of deep learning, classified and recognized 18 species of birds 
(Xie et al., 2018). Since 2015, many research teams have exploited deep 
learning to classify birdsong in the LifeCLEF bird recognition challenge. 
For example, Piczak used deep learning to identify South American birds 
in the BirdCLEF 2016 competition (Piczak, 2016). T´oth et al. used CNN 
for feature learning in the same competition, and achieved good results 
(T´oth  and  Czeba,  2016).  Based  on  Xception,  extracted  logmel  or  log-
linear  spectra  as  features  in  BirdCLEF  2020,  Bai  et  al.  used  data 
enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of bird

5.2. Result analysis 

The datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the 
ratio of 8:2. And the number of test samples and training samples are 
3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with 
the training set, and accuracy on test set is used as indicator to evaluate 
performance of classification models. 

5.2.1. Classic CNN model 

The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model, and 

their classification performance on the test set is shown in Table 6.

5.2.3. Proposed models

The  hardware  platform  used  in  this  experiment  is  a  desktop  com-
puter with 128G memory, 16 core and 32 thread CPU, 3.40 GHz fre-
quency  and  24G  GPU.  The  operating  system  is  Windows  10  64-bit 
professional operating system. Annaconda3, PyCharm 2020.1, Python 
3.7, TensorFlow 2.6 as deep learning platform and MATLAB 2018b as 
data processing platform are exploited. Table 4 shows the labels used for 
various features. 

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two groups of 
experiments are designed for comparison and analysis. The one exper-
iment is to compare the proposed model with the classic CNN model. 
That is, using the CNN to classify the spectrums of HHT, WT and STFT. 
Another experiment is to compare the proposed model with the machine

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, some details can be inferred about the platforms and tools used during the development and testing phases.

The experiments were conducted on a desktop computer running Windows 10 64-bit professional operating system, equipped with 128GB memory, 16 cores, 32 threads, and a 3.40 GHz frequency processor. Additionally, it had a 24GB GPU.

As for software, Anaconda3, PyCharm 2020.1, Python 3.7, TensorFlow 2.6, and MATLAB 2018b were utilized. TensorFlow 2.6 served as the deep learning platform, while MATLAB 2018b was employed for data processing purposes.

Although not explicitly stated, it could be assumed that the deployment process might involve saving the trained model weights and architecture, possibly through model serialization techniques like checkpointing or exporting the entire model as a single file. Then, these saved files would be loaded onto the desired platform for further use.

However, without more precise information regarding the deployment process, this remains speculative. It is recommended to refer back to the original source material or consult with the authors for accurate details.
