Commonly used correlation analysis methods, such as the Pearson correlation, cannot accurately 

capture  these  complex  relationships.  To  address  this  deficiency,  MIC  analysis  is  often 

recommended  to  detect  both  linear  and  nonlinear  associations  between  two  variables  in  large 

datasets  (Reshef  et  al.,  2011).  MIC  has  been  extensively  used  to  select  candidate  predictors  for

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, it appears that there are no specific details about the use of a particular deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, in the pipeline for water quality management. However, one of the cited papers mentions applications of deep learning in water quality management, which suggests that some form of deep learning may be involved in the process. Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine exactly what type of deep learning model is being used.
