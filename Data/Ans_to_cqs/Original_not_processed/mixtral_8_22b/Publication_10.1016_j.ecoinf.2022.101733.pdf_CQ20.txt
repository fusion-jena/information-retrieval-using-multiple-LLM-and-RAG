Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

• batch 1: visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 2: twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2 data  
• batch 3: MS + spectral indices  
• batch 4: MS + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands  
• batch  5:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1 

bands  

• batch  6:  MS  + spectral  features  + textural  features  + Sentinel-1 

bands + DSM

according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this context.
