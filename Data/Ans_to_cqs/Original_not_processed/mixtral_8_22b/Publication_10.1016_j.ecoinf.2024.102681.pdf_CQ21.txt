time window. These carefully curated datasets were then used for the 
model training process. This process involved an iterative approach to 
extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model, 
thus enabling the identification and analysis of evolving patterns in the 
weights associated with each specific influencing factor.

to  the  size  and  number  of  convolution  kernels  and  hyperparameters, 
such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

For  this  study,  the  specific  implementation  steps  are  as  follows: 
Firstly,  the  data  of  drought  propagation  time  from  January  1950  to 
December 2020 were divided into training and testing sets in 6:4. Sub-
sequently, a 4 Ã— 2 matrix was constructed using values from eight de-
soil  moisture,  actual 
terminants: 
evapotranspiration, sunspots, ENSO, AO, and PDO. Feature maps were 
extracted  from  the  matrix  using  CNN,  and  the  LSTM  network  was 
employed to capture time dependency and accurately model the inter-
play  between  drought  propagation  times  and  the  eight  factors.  The 
specific architecture of the CNN-LSTM (C-L) hybrid model is shown in 
Fig. 2. In practical applications for datasets of different land cover types, 
the number of convolutional layers in the CNN is initially adjusted, as it 
has the greatest impact on model accuracy. Subsequently, the parame-
ters for the LSTM component are determined, followed by adjustments

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of input features; and fine-tuning the model parameters if necessary. It should be noted that these steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
