Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

where  zi  is  the  output  value  of  the  i-th  neuron,  wj  is  the  convolution 
weight for input value xj, bi  is the bias, and f is the activation function. 
The  Pooling  Layer  performs  data  downsampling,  reducing  dimen-
sionality and extracting essential features. The most common pooling 
method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region 
of  input  data.  Pooling  helps  reduce  the  number  of  parameters  and 
computations,  enhances  invariance  to  small  shifts  and  scale  changes, 
and improves the model's generalization ability.

The Fully Connected Layer represents a classic multi-layer percep-
tron  and  performs  matrix  multiplication  between  input  data  and 
weights. It enables the model to capture more complex nonlinear de-
pendencies  and  generalize  information  from  previous  layers.  Each 
neuron in the fully connected layer receives input data from all neurons 
in the previous layer and applies an activation function to obtain the 
output value. 

The Output Layer is the final layer of the neural network, generating 
LULC  classification  predictions.  Typically,  an  activation  function  like 
Softmax is used to obtain probability estimates for each LULC class. 

The LULC Map is the ultimate result of classification, representing a 
spatial  map  of  land  use  and  land  cover.  Each  pixel  in  the  LULC  map 
depicts the class to which it belongs, based on the model's predictions.

2.3. Performing LULC analysis using a deep convolutional neural network 

The  classification  of  LULC  was  carried  out  using  a  convolutional 
neural network (CNN). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an 
architecture of deep neural networks widely applied for land use and 
land cover (LULC) classification (Balarabe and Jordanov, 2021; Li et al., 
2019;  Zaabar  et  al.,  2022).  They  are  specifically  designed  for  image 
processing  and  possess  the  capability  to  automatically  extract  spatial 
hierarchical features from data.

Helpful Answer:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for performing LULC analysis. CNNs are a popular choice for image processing tasks due to their ability to automatically extract hierarchical spatial features from data. In this case, they are employed for land use and land cover (LULC) classification.
