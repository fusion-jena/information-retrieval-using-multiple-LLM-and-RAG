Appendix C. The training of the models 

The best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs, as seen in Fig. C.5. Note that we observe 
overfitting after nine epochs, where the validation loss starts to increase, although the bias is still very low. The increase is indicated by a higher 
difference between training and validation loss and bias is the loss evaluated on the training dataset. 

Note that the largest variation is 0.6%, which is very similar to the variation of 0.8% when training with different values of α in Fig. B.4. This 

indicates a minimal impact on the change of accuracy for different choices of α.

The  performances  of  ResNet50  and  EfficientNetB3  with  transfer 
learning are very similar; however, at the species level (3), ResNet50 has 
a  higher  standard  deviation  (0.32%).  State-of-the-art  models  trained 
with transfer learning and without MTL have an F1-score of 96%, similar 
to models trained with MTL at the species level. The models trained with 
ResNet  and  EfficientNet  have  the  absolute  best  performance  and 
outperform the benchmark YOLOv5 model on the TL dataset referenced 
in (Bjerge et al., 2023a). This is expected since the tasks performed by 
YOLOv5 include both object detection as well as classification. No other 
state-of-the-art CNN models were evaluated since it is not expected to 
achieve scores higher than 96% to 99% already achieved and the main 
purpose  was  to  demonstrate  that  different  CNNs  can  be  modified  for

Helpful Answer:
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves observing the total loss after each epoch. In this case, the best model with transfer learning was selected based on the minimum total loss observed after nine epochs. Overfitting was monitored by checking if the validation loss started increasing while keeping track of the difference between training and validation losses. Additionally, the bias was also considered, which is the loss evaluated on the training dataset. To further ensure optimal performance, the largest variation in accuracy was kept minimal, indicating a minimal impact on the change of accuracy for different choices of alpha.
