Identification of optional ecological sources 

The SOFM is an unsupervised learning neural network approach that 
combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate 
research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The 
ES bundles were divided using SOFM (using the R package kohonen) 
based on the results of the reconstructed ESV, and the ideal number of 
bundles  was  established  by  calculating  the  Davis-Boldin  Index  (DBI), 
which was used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting 
scenarios. Furthermore, this study used hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*
i ) 
to  analyze the  spatial clustering of  ESV and  considered  hotspot areas 
with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

biodiversity. The habitat maintenance bundle accounted for 32% of the 
total area, mainly constituting woodlands, and was characterized by the 
highest delivery of biodiversity, water conservation, and raw materials, 
whereas it had a moderate delivery of other services.

learning neural network characterized by the topographic map structure 
of  the  input  scenario.  This  algorithm  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of 
linear dimensionality reduction techniques and can objectively classify 
ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting and automatically 
form weights among the elements, avoiding the subjectivity of weight 
setting  (Zhao  et  al.,  2023).  Consequently,  applying  SOFM  to  identify 
ecological sources can effectively analyze the geographical variability 
and similarity of ESs while also uncovering the dominant service func-
tions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological 
sources  are  located.  This  study  combined  the  SOFM  algorithm  with 
traditional  ESP  construction  paradigms,  which  emphasize  the  consid-
eration of the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs, and 
can  provide  a  new  idea  for  the  construction  and  optimization  of

points were mostly found in the center of the mountain greenbelt, those 
in  the  southern  section  of  the  region  were  concentrated  around  river 
tributaries and watercourses.

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information about the methodology used in the study can be extracted from the text.

In this study, the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) is employed as an unsupervised learning neural network approach. It combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles based on spatial similarities. The ES bundles are divided using SOFM, and the ideal number of bundles is determined by calculating the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI). Hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) is then applied to examine the spatial clustering of ESV and consider hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or higher as potential ecological sources.

While these methods do not directly relate to addressing data bias in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate how the researchers approached their task of identifying ecological sources. In general, when dealing with data bias in machine learning models, various strategies like stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets can help mitigate biases and improve model performance. These techniques aim to balance classes, reduce imbalances, and ensure fair representation across all groups within the dataset.
