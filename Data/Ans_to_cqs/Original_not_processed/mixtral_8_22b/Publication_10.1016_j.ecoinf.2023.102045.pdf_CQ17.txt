different activities ranging from day-to-day tasks such as route planning 
to furthering scientific studies, such as the effects of climate change or 
the spread of invasive species. Despite their widespread use, maps can be 
problematic  information  resources  (Burrough,  1986).  Any  map  is  a 
generalisation, hence an imperfect representation of the features shown, 
as  any  data  gathering  and  representation  which  inevitably  leads  to  a 
reduction of the original data complexity (Palmer et al., 2008). A map is 
also  typically interpreted  visually, thus  different people  may  come  to 
dissimilar conclusions about the mapped features.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly known regularization techniques include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to avoid overfitting by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reduced risk of overfitting.
