2.3. Fish classification by species 

A classifier based on deep neural networks was also used for this task. 
In this case, the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose 
main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016).

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses two main datasets in their deep learning pipeline. For fish segmentation, they use manually annotated data consisting of 275 segments and automatically generated data containing 6921 segments. They apply data augmentation techniques to increase the number of images to 14,896. For fish classification, they use the ImageNet dataset to pretrain their ResNet50V2 model. However, the exact composition or source of these datasets is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
