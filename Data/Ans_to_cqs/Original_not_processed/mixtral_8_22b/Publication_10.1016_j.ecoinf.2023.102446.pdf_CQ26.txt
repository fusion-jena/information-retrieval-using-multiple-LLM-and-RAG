2.2. Data collection and processing

rogates  (100  surrogates)  and  a  significance  level  of  1%. The  network 
computation considered lagged information (τ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h).

Data availability 

The half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables 
used  in  this  study  is  available  with  Dr.  Sandipan  Mukherjee  and  the 
competent  authorities  of  G.  B.  Pant  National  Institute  of  Himalayan 
Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.

flux tower data was not available to us from the data handling group; 
hence, we had to constrain our study to a period spanning two years, 
specifically  from  December  2014  to  November  2016.  This  signifies  a 
limitation of the study. We also would like to highlight that in these 2 
years,  the  links  appearing  in  the  causal  networks  remained  relatively 
consistent.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that the authors have taken certain measures to ensure the quality and reliability of their dataset. For instance, they have collected data over a significant time frame using various sensors measuring different environmental factors. They have also mentioned the use of lagged information (τ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h) which suggests that they have considered historical data points while analyzing the current ones. Furthermore, they have acknowledged the limitation of their study due to unavailability of post-2016 flux tower data. Despite these efforts, without explicit mention of techniques used to handle data bias, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were employed by the authors.
