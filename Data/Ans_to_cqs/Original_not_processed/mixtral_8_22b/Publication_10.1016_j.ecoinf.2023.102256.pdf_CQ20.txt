The baseline model comprised a simple CNN architecture that had 
two  convolutional layers (8  filters of  size 16 × 16,  with ReLU activa-
tions), followed by max pooling (4 × 4), a flattening operation, and two 
fully-connected layers (32 ReLU and 22 softmax units respectively) (see 
Fig. 2). Given only a spectrogram input, the baseline model produced a 
probability for each of the 22 species. 

3.3.2. Case II: One-hot encoding 

Different methods were explored and tested to enhance the neural 
network with contextual information. One straightforward approach to 
incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, while 
maintaining  model  simplicity,  is  to  utilize  a  multi-branch  CNN.  As  a 
result, we investigate this approach as the initial method to integrate

ment while enabling a simple CNN to be improved whilst also keeping 
the number of network parameters low (Case I: 27 654 parameters, Case

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The context does not mention any details about the hardware or computational resources utilized during the training process. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided text.
