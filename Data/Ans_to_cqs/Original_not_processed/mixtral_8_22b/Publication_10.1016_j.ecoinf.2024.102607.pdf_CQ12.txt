In addition to selecting the RS imagery and representative training 
samples, the choice of machine learning (ML) algorithm directly affects 
the accuracy of the classification results. Currently, a wide range of ML 
algorithms are extensively employed in LULC mapping, including sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) (Adugna et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2017), 
random forests (RFs) (Svoboda et al., 2022), decision trees (DTs) (Shih 
et al., 2018), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Amani et al., 2020; 
Hu et al., 2021). Researchers have frequently compared the accuracies 
of LULC maps derived from different classifiers (Shih et al., 2021). The 
RF  classifier  outperformed  the  other  ML  classifiers,  as  confirmed  by 
LULC (Shih et al., 2018; Yuh et al., 2023) and crop mapping (Inglada 
et al., 2015). RF has lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and stronger 
robustness against noise (Wa´sniewski et al., 2022). Furthermore, RF can

sampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). An incorrect sampling strategy may 
increase the training complexity and lead to overfitting phenomena (Gu 
et al., 2022). These studies, through improved sampling strategies, were 
all  based  on  a  traditional  overall  model.  However,  the  overall  model 
required  significant  computing  capabilities  for  large-scale  LULC  map-
ping. To further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle 
the  problem  of  unbalanced training  data  in  RF-based  LULC  mapping, 
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy 
along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in 
Madagascar,  a  region  characterized  by  highly  heterogeneous 
landscapes.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) being used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. Among these, the Random Forest (RF) classifier is mentioned as having better performance and robustness against noise. Additionally, the text mentions the application of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, Sentinel imagery, and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada but does not specify which type of neural network was used. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
