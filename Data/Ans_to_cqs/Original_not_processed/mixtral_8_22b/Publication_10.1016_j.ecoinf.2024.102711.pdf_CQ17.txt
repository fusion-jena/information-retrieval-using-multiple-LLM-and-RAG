for machine learning applications (Patki et al., 2016). This approach has 
been utilized to improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning 
models by increasing both the quantity (i.e., enlarging the input dataset 
(Khanmohammadi et al., 2023a) and quality (e.g., addressing imbalance 
issues  (Khanmohammadi  et  al.,  2023b))  of  the  original  real-world 
datasets.  This  is  particularly  observed  with  classifier  models,  with 
their  performance  being  negatively  affected  by  imbalanced  datasets 
(Arashpour et al., 2021).

Data-driven models depend on a number of parameters, known as 
hyperparameters,  which  are  employed  to  enhance  and  regulate  the 
learning  procedure.  Optimal  hyperparameter  selection 
leads  to 
improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance (Aze-
dou et al., 2023). To fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models, 
the development dataset (comprising all data records except the evalu-
ation data records) is divided into two categories: the training dataset 
and the tuning dataset. Given the size constrains of the dataset used in 
the  analysis  and  the  need  to  utilize  all  development  data  records  in 
training  to  enhance  the  modelâ€™s  generalization  ability,  k-fold  cross- 
validation  was  chosen  as  the  preferred  approach  for  hyperparameter 
tuning (Saha et al., 2022). In this technique, the development dataset is 
evenly divided into k groups. During each iteration, one group called the

The results showed the issue of overfitting in ML modelling, namely 
when the learning dataset used is relatively small. Some recent studies 
have  evaluated  model  performance  against  the  data  used  in  model 
fitting  and  tuning  (e.g.  Kucuk  and  Sevinc  (2023).  This  may  fail  to 
identify the true fit and behaviour of ML models, because ML models aim 
to  maximize  accuracy  against  the  model  development  (training  and 
tuning) dataset. Our model evaluation against an independent dataset 
revealed  true  model  fit,  which  in  our  case  was  10%  lower  than  that 
obtained against the model development dataset) in the best performing 
models and about 30% lower in the worst performing ones. Analysis of 
model behaviour also showed flawed behaviour in some models, such as 
non-monotonic trends that result from overfitting. The overfitting (i.e. 
where the model captures not only the trend but also the noise in the

2.6. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

AutoML offers a substantial level of automation, encompassing tasks 
such  as  including  data  pre-processing,  algorithm  selection,  and  opti-
mizing hyperparameters. These individual steps can pose challenges for 
non-expert data scientists, creating substantial barriers to designing and 
implementing algorithms effectively. Consequently, AutoML was intro-
duced to streamline these intricate processes for non-experts, making it 
more accessible to use these techniques correctly and efficiently (Rah-
man et al., 2023). In this study, two AutoML models, AutoGluon and 
TabPFN, were employed.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I can explain what those methods are and how they work.

Dropout is a regularization method used during the training process of neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly dropping out neurons along with their incoming and outgoing connections during training. This helps reduce co-dependency among neurons and encourages them to learn more robust features independently. Dropout rates typically range between 0.2 and 0.5.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another popular regularization method used to combat overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By doing so, it discourages large weights and promotes smaller, more distributed representations. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter lambda, which determines the tradeoff between minimizing the loss and keeping the weights small.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization capabilities of deep learning models by reducing overfitting and promoting better feature learning.
