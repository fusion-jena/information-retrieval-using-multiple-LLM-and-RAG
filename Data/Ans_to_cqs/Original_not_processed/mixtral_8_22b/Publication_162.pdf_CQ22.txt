Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

AP50 and AP75 denote the average precision at an inter-
section  over  union  (IoU)  threshold  of  50  and  75%,
respectively. AP denotes the average precision over IoU
thresholds from 50 to 95% in 5% increments. The out-
lined metrics are summarized for bounding box detec-
tion and segmentation in Table 2.

results in an unchanged expected activation in the fol-
lowing  convolutional  layers.  Furthermore,  we  nor-
malize all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth)
by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the
respective standard deviation over the whole dataset.
We also introduce a feature fusion module to combine
the extracted features from both backbones using one
3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduce the num-
ber of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This allows us to
use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO data-
set [24] for the region proposal network (RPN) classi-
fier and mask head. Fig. 4 illustrates the general archi-
tecture of the resulting D-Mask R-CNN architecture.
We  restrict  our  evaluation  of  D-Mask  R-CNN  to
instances of deers as it is the most common species in our
RGB-D dataset. We quantify the results of D-Mask R-
CNN using the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75
metrics as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset [24].

We then trained a standard deep learning classifier
(ResNet-50 [16] pre-trained on ImageNet [30]) on the
cropped  bounding  box  images  of  the  detected  moths
and  achieved  an  average  accuracy  of  89.00%  on  an
held-out test set. We also make use of additional images
obtained  from  Internet  image  search  engines  to  aug-
ment the training dataset. However, since this leads to
noisy annotated images, filtering different types of label
noise  is  required  as  proposed  by  [6].  This  can  further
improve  the  recognition  performance  of  the  system,
especially when the initial training set has been rather
small with less than ten sample images per species.

Helpful Answer:
The performance of the deep learning model, specifically D-Mask R-CNN, is evaluated using several metrics. These include Average Precision (AP), AP50, and AP75. AP refers to the average precision over Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50 to 95 percent in 5 percent increments. On the other hand, AP50 and AP75 denote the average precision at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 50 and 75 percent respectively. Additionally, a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50) was employed to train on cropped bounding box images of detected objects, achieving an average accuracy of 89.00 percent on a held-out test set.
