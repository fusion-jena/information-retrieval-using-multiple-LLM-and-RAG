the  analysis  of  observational  complex  networks  can  inform  novel  ap-
proaches for model representations (e.g. stochastic block models (Fas-
kowitz  et  al.,  2018)).  A  special  feature  of  this  work  is  that  we  have 
concentrated on diel cycles, but concerning the possibility that FCMs can 
be  formed  for  any  recording  groups,  other  time  scales  also  become 
feasible. For instance, networks for days, weeks or months can be build 
or  we  could  even  analyze  networks  within  single  recordings.  Finally, 
evolving networks could reveal transitions in the dynamics of the urban 
AE (Belykh et al., 2014).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

2. Visualization: Techniques like saliency maps, activation maximization, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM), etc., can help visualize what parts of the input data contribute most to the output prediction. These techniques can provide insights into how the model makes decisions and identify potential biases or errors.

3. Confusion matrices: They offer a summary of the predictions made by the model compared with actual labels. It helps understand where the model performs well and where it struggles.

4. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models to improve overall performance is another popular postprocessing technique. Methods include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

5. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters based on validation set performance can further optimize the model. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., are commonly used techniques.

6. Data preprocessing: Depending on the problem domain, additional data preprocessing might be required before feeding the data into the model. Examples include normalizing inputs, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.

The exact postprocessing steps will depend on the specific task and dataset being analyzed. In the given context, no explicit information about postprocessing steps was mentioned; however, these general guidelines should apply broadly across different applications.
