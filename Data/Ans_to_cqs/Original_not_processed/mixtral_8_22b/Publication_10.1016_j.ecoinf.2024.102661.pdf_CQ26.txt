Hyperparameters  are  instrumental  in  shaping  the  architecture  of 
deep  learning  models and  steering  the  learning  process  (Bischl et  al., 
2023).  The  TPEBO  algorithm  stands  out  for  its  strategic  approach  to 
hyperparameter optimization. Beginning with an exploratory phase of 
random  searches  for  feasible  hyperparameter  configurations,  TPEBO 
progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space 
where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global 
optimum  with  increasing  precision.  This  methodological  approach  is 
particularly  beneficial  for  fine-tuning  LSTM  models,  known  for  their 
intricate  structures.  By  automating  the  hyperparameter  adjustment 
process,  TPEBO  not  only  enhances  the  model's  efficiency  but  also 
significantly  curtails  the  time  traditionally  spent  on  manual  tuning, 
making the modeling workflow more efficient. The process is succinctly

Number of cells in hidden layers: Vital for fitting complex functions, 
the range for the number of cells in each layer is set between 10 and 200. 
This range balances the need to capture intricate data patterns and avoid 
overfitting.

updates (leading to prolonged training).

The  input  dataset,  hyperparameter  search  range,  optimization 
objective  function,  and  algorithm  predefined  are  integrated  into  the 
TPEBO-LSTM  model.  The  model  undergoes  a  training  process 
comprising 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model logs the 
chosen  hyperparameter  combinations,  associated  training  times,  and 

loss  values.  This  systematic  recording  aims  to  pinpoint  the  hyper-
parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the 
calculations.

Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remark-
able stability and effectiveness in big data analytics (Bai et al., 2019; 
Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023).  Recently,  these  techniques  have  been 
increasingly  applied  to  carbon  emission  forecasting,  showcasing  their 
broad utility (Table 1). Among these, Backpropagation Neural Networks 
(BPNN) stand out for their widespread use and notable forecast accuracy 
(Lin et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2023). Yet, more recent 
studies have highlighted that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural 
networks  outperform  other  models  in  both  forecast  accuracy  and 
training  efficiency  (Kumar,  2023;  Liu  et  al.,  2024b;  Shi  et  al.,  2023). 
Furthermore,  LSTM  have  been  recognized  for  their  ability  to  adeptly 
handle multiple time-variable inputs, exhibiting superior accuracy and 
stability compared to traditional machine learning models (Gokul et al.,

Helpful Answer:
While the given context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it provides insights into the application of deep learning models, specifically LSTM networks, in carbon emission forecasting. However, addressing data bias is crucial in any machine learning or deep learning task. Common techniques include stratified sampling, which ensures that different subgroups in the population are represented proportionately in all samples, oversampling, where minority classes are replicated to match the majority class, undersampling, where instances from the majority class are removed to match the minority class, and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources to ensure representation. These techniques help mitigate issues such as imbalanced datasets, skewed distributions, and lack of diversity, ultimately improving the fairness and reliability of the model predictions.
