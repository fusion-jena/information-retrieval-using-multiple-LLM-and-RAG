Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes: 
Identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China

Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that 64 water samples were used for model calibration, which can be interpreted as the training set. The remaining samples were used for validation. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria or methodology used to split the dataset into these subsets. Typically, datasets are randomly divided into training, testing, and validation sets based on predefined ratios such as 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. It is essential to ensure that the distribution of classes or features remains consistent across all subsets to prevent biased results.

In this case, since no explicit splitting criterion is mentioned, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact method used to divide the dataset. Nonetheless, it is safe to assume that some form of random sampling or stratified sampling might have been employed to maintain consistency across the subsets.
