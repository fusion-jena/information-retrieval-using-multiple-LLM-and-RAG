data collection and curation phases.

we break them down into smaller patches. Specifically, in the training 
stage,  we  randomly  crop  square  patches  (experimenting  with  various 
patch sizes, namely 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels), and we apply a 
simple  augmentation  strategy,  flipping  the  patches  horizontally  and 
vertically with a 50% probability. On the other hand, during the vali-
dation phase, we divide the images of the validation split into regularly- 
spaced,  overlapping  patches,  using  the  same  size  employed  during 
training.  We  process  these  patches  individually,  reconstructing  the 
overall  output  by  combining  the  predictions  from  the  patches,  and 
subsequently, we calculate metrics over the complete image. For clarity, 
Fig.  2  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  this  procedure.  In  more 
detail,  for  the  solution  based  on  detection,  we  reconstruct  the  final 
global  output  using  non-maximum  suppression  among  the  bounding

Fig. 3. Generated ground-truth. Ground-truth required for the training phase is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific 
deep learning model PCθ  being employed:: (i) bounding boxes are generated by creating squares centered over the dots with a fixed side length s, (ii) density maps are 
produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels Gσ  centered at the dot positions, and (iii) segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs having 
radius r and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. The parameters s, σ, and r are constants that are established based on the standard object sizes 
prevalent in the images. Best viewed in electronic format.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that during the training stage, simple augmentation strategies are applied to the cropped square patches. These include flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. However, it does not explicitly mention any other data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling. Therefore, based on the given information, the only data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are horizontal and vertical flips.
