The validated data is then loaded to the Access tier through an in-
cremental  ETL (extract, transform, and load) procedure acquiring the 
validated data from the Harbor tier. 

3.2.4. Analytical fruition

In the following, we disclose all the details of the main data platform 
components, starting with the presentation of all data sources (Section 
3.2.1)  and  continuing  with  the  integration  and  enrichment  processes 
(Section 3.2.2), the validation and loading processes (Section 3.2.3), and 
concluding with the analytical fruition (Section 3.2.4). 

3.2.1. Data sources

The relational schema of CASE’s database is shown in Fig. A.18. CASE is based on a concept of Task, i.e., a questionnaire that must be fulfilled by a 
User (i.e., an on-field operator). Each task is composed by a set of Questions, categorized in different types (e.g., multiple answers, date picker) each 
composed by a set of predefined Answers (one of which could be an open answer, defined by the user when selecting the Given answer). The 
dynamic aspect of CASE’s questionnaires lies in the association of each possible answer with a different one to be shown next. Thus, users fulfilling the 
same task may follow different paths of questions depending on the given answers. This enables a customized and efficient user experience, as detailed 
questions on a given topic may be asked only if such a topic has been mentioned by the user. Instances of tasks (i.e., Task on geo-object) are

3.2.1. Data sources 

A  summary  of  the  many  data  sources  is  shown  in  Table  1,  which 
reports the frequency of updates and space occupation for each source. 
The monitoring network (managed by CASE, introduced in Section 
3.1.2) is the main source, providing the number of H. halys captures on a 
weekly basis. For each deployed trap, we collected the coordinates of 
deployment and a list of environmental elements visually identified in 
the surroundings by the technician that deployed the trap (e.g., tree fruit 
crops, herbaceous crops, buildings). Then, for each deployed trap and 
week within the monitoring session, we collected the number of H. halys 
captured (divided into small instars, large instars, and adults), together 
with an indication of the correct functioning of the trap.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text mentions various components of a data platform, including data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading procedures, and analytical fruition. However, it does not provide any explicit reference to a cloud service provider or platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot accurately identify the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
