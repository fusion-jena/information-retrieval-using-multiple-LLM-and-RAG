query set are negative. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) propose transductive
propagation that iteratively propagates labels from labelled instances to
unlabelled instances according to the graph structure of the embeddings.

samples (red line) compared to randomly ordered samples, no active
learning (blue line), and active learning using high-certainty samples
(yellow line). The baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way
test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). The AST feature extraction
model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples. Model perfor-
mance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each
of the three sample orderings. Low certainty refers to queries with a
similar Euclidean distance to prototypical embeddings and therefore lie
along decision boundaries. For high-certainty samples, the order is
reversed with query embedding in close proximity to prototypical em-
beddings being prioritised for model fine-tuning.

A recommender system, Fig. 4, ranks segment embeddings in order
of lowest certainty to highest certainty. Low-certainty embeddings
correspond to features on decision boundaries. The Euclidean distance ld
is computed between existing prototypes cd and the query embeddings q
providing both class suggestion and class probability using P(q ∈ d | ld)
= softmax(1 (cid:0) norm(ld)). The recommender ranks queries in terms of

This methodology has been implemented into the Listening Lab
Annotator Tool (McEwen et al., 2023b), shown in Fig. 5. The following

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of active learning, which is a type of machine learning where the algorithm can interactively query the user to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. In this case, low-certainty embeddings corresponding to features on decision boundaries are ranked higher by the recommender system. This approach helps improve the performance of the model by focusing on uncertain examples during fine-tuning. Additionally, the text discusses transductive propagation, which involves iteratively propagating labels from labeled instances to unlabeled ones based on the graph structure of the embeddings. These methods contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning pipeline but do not directly address the optimization techniques mentioned in the query.
