Deep learning can greatly surpass conventional machine learning by incorporating multi-
layered neural networks capable of processing natural data in their raw form (LeCun et al.
2015).   Deep   convolutional   neural   networks   (CNNs)   are   especially   well   suited   to   image
classiﬁcation and may even achieve superhuman performance (He et al. 2015). Already,
CNNs are playing important roles in healthcare, speech recognition, and driverless cars.
Natural history collections (NHCs) also beneﬁt society in numerous ways, most notably
supporting   public   health,   safety,   and   agriculture   (Suarez   and   Tsutsui   2004).   NHCs   are
likewise fundamental to understanding biodiversity and they underlie studies of evolution,
habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. The billions of specimens in NHCs
could   undoubtedly   provide   even   greater   social   and   scientiﬁc   insight,   but   their   data   are

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in deep learning research to use these methods to improve the robustness and reliability of the models. Therefore, while not directly stated, it is possible that some of these techniques could have been employed during the development and training of the deep learning models described in this study.

Unhelpful Answer:
I am sorry, I cannot find information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in the given context.
