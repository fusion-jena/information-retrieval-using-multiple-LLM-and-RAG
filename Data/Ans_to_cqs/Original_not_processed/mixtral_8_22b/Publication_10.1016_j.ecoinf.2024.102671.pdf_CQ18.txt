Secondly, the main challenge of the study lies in employing a more 
refined  cross-validation  approach  that  should  incorporate  temporal, 
spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological data. Effective 
cross-validation  is  essential  for  assessing  the  generalizability  and 
robustness of ecological zoning models (Roberts et al., 2017). The future 
study could focus on using statistical and machine learning techniques to 
model the relationship between landscape features and ecological car-
bon  sink capabilities. Implement cross-validation  techniques to  assess 
the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit details about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method. Cross-validation is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of a model during training by dividing the dataset into subsets or folds, then iteratively fitting the model on one subset while evaluating its performance on another. This process helps prevent overfitting and provides a reliable estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Therefore, we can infer that some form of cross-validation was likely employed to monitor the model performance during training.
