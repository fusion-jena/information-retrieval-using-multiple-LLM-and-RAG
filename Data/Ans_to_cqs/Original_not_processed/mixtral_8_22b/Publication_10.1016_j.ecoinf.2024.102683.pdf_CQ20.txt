Therefore, it is important to take into account several features and 
place  emphasis  on  the  features  that  are  efficient  for  different  herbs. 
Performance  of  deep  neural  networks  will  be  enhanced  when  the 
attention  mechanism  enables  them  to  precisely  focus  on  all  relevant 
input elements. This method has become a popular technique in DL for 
text classification, image interpretation, and sentiment analysis (Wani 
et al., 2020). Models like attention mechanisms have high accuracy, and 
most of these mechanisms can be jointly trained with a basic model, such 
as a recurrent neural network or a convolutional neural network (CNN), 
using  a  regular  back-propagation  algorithm.  In  DL  models,  feature 
extraction  takes  place  hierarchically  through  CNNs  from  a  global 
perspective. At the same time, the attention mechanism focuses on the 
significant information of an image, improving the performance of CNN

attention mechanisms enhance efficiency of deep learning (DL) networks by allowing them to precisely focus on 
all relevant input elements. In order to enhance the performance of the proposed model, the CA was implemented 
based on four pooling operations including global average pooling-based CA (GAP-CA), mixed pooling-based CA 
(Mixed-CA), gated pooling-based CA (Gated-CA), and tree pooling-based CA (Tree-CA) operations. The results 
showed that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art 
models, achieving the values of 99.63%, 99.38%, 99.52%, 99.74%, and 99.42%, for accuracy, precision, recall, 
specificity, and F1-score, respectively. The findings support our proposed attention model's success in identifying 
medicinal  plants  from  similar  poisonous  plants.  Recent  advancements  in  computer-based  technologies  and

Deep learning (DL) has become an advanced method in the field of 
computer science, but despite their high learning capacity, models based 
on DL often face a challenge called overfitting. To overcome the over-
fitting problem, deep neural networks must be supported by a significant 
amount of labeled data. Data augmentation (DA) technique is used as a 
basic  method  to  quantitatively  increase  and  diversify  training  data 
(Momeny et al., 2021; Momeny et al., 2023). DA is a technique in which 
the training set is artificially increased by creating modified copies of a 
dataset using the existing data. Using a designed set of DAs instead of 
simple  random  transformations  during  data  training  can  significantly 
improve  the  generalization  ability  of  the  network  (Hsia  et  al.,  2022; 
Jahanbakhshi et al., 2021a; Momeny et al., 2022). As the name suggests, 
automatic DA methods work automatically, and help us avoid the per-

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, typically, deep learning models require substantial computational power due to their complex nature and large datasets. Common hardware resources used for training deep learning models include central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and sometimes even specialized hardware accelerators. CPUs are generally slower compared to GPUs and TPUs, while GPUs offer parallel computing capabilities making them suitable for handling matrix multiplications required in deep learning algorithms. On the other hand, TPUs are specifically designed for machine learning tasks and can further improve the speed and efficiency of training deep learning models. Therefore, without explicit mention in the provided text, one could assume that any of these hardware resources might have been utilized for training the deep learning model.
