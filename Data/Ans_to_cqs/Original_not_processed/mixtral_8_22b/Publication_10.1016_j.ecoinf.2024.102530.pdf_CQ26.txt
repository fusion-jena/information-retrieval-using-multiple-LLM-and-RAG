The effective solution of our tree-based FIS in Apis-FIS, the last node 
of  our  architecture  with  two  input  Prox-FIS  and  LCWT-FIS.  For  the 
output  of  Apis-FIS,  we  used  triangular  and  trapezoidal  membership 
function  with  five  fuzzy  sets  for  the  output  with:  “very  low  suitable” 
(VLS), “low suitable” (LS), “moderate suitable” (MS), “suitable” (S) and 
“highly suitable” (HS) for linguistic variables appear in Fig. 10.

flight time and performance. Flying time and performance is linked to 
many weather factors like temperature, wind, precipitation, solar radi-
ation, and these factors combined dictate if and when honey bees will 
take flight.

Based on this evaluation, we performed a cross-comparison based on 
our ApisFis model and validation data. Fig. 17 presents the result of the 
matching comparison for the 12 sites. For each, the field estimations are 
close to the outcome of our model. For sites 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 and 12 the 
outcome  of  the  field  campaign  is,  respectively,  low,  moderate,  and 
suitable. Our model yields very similar results to the field estimations for 
these sites. However, for some sites, the field estimations were higher 
than our model prediction (Sites 1 &  3 and 7) and for other sites, the 
field estimations were lower than the Apis-FIS model outcomes (Sites 5 
& 9 & 10 & 11).

Helpful Answer:
In order to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels within both subsets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to uneven representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are generated from existing minority class examples to balance out the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being overly influenced by the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing instances from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. While this may lead to loss of information, it can help reduce bias caused by imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset accurately represents real-world scenarios. By incorporating different viewpoints and experiences, the resulting model becomes more robust and generalizable across multiple domains.

These techniques play crucial roles in mitigating data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines, ultimately leading to improved model performance and fairness.
