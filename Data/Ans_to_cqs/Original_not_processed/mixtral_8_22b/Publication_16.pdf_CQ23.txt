The results presented in this section were obtained over 100 
epochs. Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the 
test  and  validation  data  during  model  training.  The  figure 
shows  that  there  was  no  overfitting  during  training  and  that 
the dropout layers helped with model regularisation. Although 
model convergence was achieved early in the training session 
the loss shows continuing decreases throughout the specified 
epochs.

Table 1 shows the performance metrics obtained using the 
test data. The best performing class was the Eurasian Collard 
Dove achieving a Sensitivity of 0.86 and a Specificity of 0.90. 
The  worst  performing  class  was 
the  Lesser  Spotted 
Woodpecker  where  the  model  attained  a  Sensitivity  of  0.58 
and a Specificity of 0.91.

Figure 9. Train and Validation Loss 

The model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split 
and 0.74 for the test split. Figure 10 shows the accuracy for 
both the train and validation data over 100 epochs. The results 
illustrate that the accuracy of the model flattens towards the 
end  of  the  training  session  and  shows  that  the  necessary 
number  of  epochs  required  for  model  convergence  is 
sufficient.  Increasing  the  number  of  epochs  would  achieve 
minimal gains in accuracy and would likely lead to overfitting.

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various bird species such as the Eurasian Collared Dove and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. This diversity in the dataset allowed the model to learn patterns across different types of birds, improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Secondly, the model employed dropout layers to aid in regularization and prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature or pattern. By incorporating dropout layers into the architecture, the model could better generalize to new data by reducing its dependence on specific features present only in the training set.

Lastly, the model underwent training over 100 epochs, allowing it to gradually converge without becoming excessively specialized to the training data. As seen in Figure 9, the loss of the model continued to decrease throughout the specified epochs, indicating ongoing improvements in the model's performance. Furthermore, Figure 10 demonstrates that the accuracy of the model plateaued towards the end of the training session, suggesting that the chosen number of epochs was sufficient for model convergence and avoiding overfitting.

In conclusion, the combination of a diverse dataset, dropout layers for regularization, and careful selection of the number of epochs contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. These measures collectively enabled the model to perform well not only on the training data but also on previously unseen data, as evidenced by the test split accuracy of 0.74.
