dataset as discussed in this article because it can potentially cause poor 
predictive performance (Liu et al., 2014).

In addition,  in the prediction  of dissolved oxygen in  water, (Chen 
et  al.,  2020)  not  only  applied  water  quality  parameters  but  also 
considered parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric 
pressure in the air as input variables for the model, providing ideas for 
subsequent research. 

At last, for the dataset as listed in Table 1, and, three different data 
processing methods were trained and tested using the proposed method,

The  above  results  and  analyses  show  that  traditional  machine 
learning  methods  (SVR)  and  deep  learning  methods  (LSTM)  can  be 
adapted  to  address  the  problems  of  poor  generalization  ability,  local 
optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models to predict 
DO concentration successfully. The machine learning and deep learning 
literature also discuss the prediction of DO concentration. For example,

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about various studies that have utilized machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water bodies. These studies include works by authors like Heddam, S., Kim, S., Mehr, A.D., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Malik, A., Elbeltagi, A., et al., 2022b; Heddam, S., Lamda, H., Filali, S., 2016; Heddam, S., Yaseen, Z.M., Falah, M.W., Goliatt, L., Tan, M.L., Sa’adi, Z., Ahmadianfar, I., Saggi, M., Bhatia, A., Samui, P., 2022; Huan, J., Cao, W., Liu, X., 2017; Areerachakul, S., Sophatsathit, P., Lursinsap, C., 2013; Arepalli, P.G., Naik, K.J., 2024 Mar.; Arora, S., Keshari, A.K., 2021; Ay, M., Kisi, O., 2012; and Ay, M., Kis¸i, 2017.

These studies employed various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including SVR, LSTM, GRNN, ANFIS, and others, to predict DO concentrations. Some of these studies considered additional environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure as input variables for their models. While the exact datasets used in these studies remain unknown from the provided context, they likely involved time series or spatial data related to water quality parameters and other relevant environmental factors.
