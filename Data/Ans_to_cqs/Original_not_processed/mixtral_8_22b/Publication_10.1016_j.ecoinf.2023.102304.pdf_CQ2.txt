parameters (Figs. A2–A4 and Fig. 4). Among these, the kappa coefficient 
is  selected  to  comprehensively  evaluate  the  detection  accuracy  for 
different  indices  and  parameter  sets.  Although  overall  accuracy  can 
quantify  the  absolute  accuracy  of  detection,  it  is  not  well-suited  for 
evaluating  the  performance  of  various  indices  for  LTR,  which  uses  a 
binary classification system of ‘burned’ and ‘unburned’ values. As can be 
seen from Figs. A2 and A3, the user's accuracy is always higher than the 
producer's  accuracy  for  any  study  area  and  indices  with  the  same 
parameter setting. That means LTR tends to have a larger omission error 
than commission error. In other words, unburned pixels are less likely to 
be mistakenly identified as burned. In most cases, although the LTR does 
not  effectively  identify  the  burned  pixels,  the  overall  accuracy  still 
maintains at a high level because the unburned pixels can be accurately

higher  MS is needed to better capture the index response to wildfire. 
Compared to the default parameters, the overall accuracy and kappa of 
optimized  parameters  can  improve  by  up  to  8.4%  and  36.8%, 
respectively.

Helpful Answer:
The given context primarily discusses remote sensing techniques and spectral indices such as BFAST, EVI, NDVI, NBR, Tasseled Cap Index, etc., used for analyzing different types of forests like conifer, deciduous, mixed, Mediterranean, boreal, tropical, savanna, etc. It also mentions Google Earth Engine, a platform for processing satellite imagery, and several research papers related to this topic. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline within the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the information available, we cannot determine what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
