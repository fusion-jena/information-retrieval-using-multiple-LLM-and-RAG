as a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefﬁcient-related loss of the three predicted

accuracy similar to human-level classiﬁcation accuracy, but in a consistent and fast way, enabling
rapid application over very large areas and/or through time [14]. For example, individual tree species

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing would have been necessary due to the nature of remote sensing data. Common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, while scaling refers to resizing input data to fit within a certain range. Cleaning may involve removing noise or irrelevant data points. The exact preprocessing steps depend on the specific requirements of the model and the characteristics of the input data.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have performed these general preprocessing tasks. However, without more detailed information, it is impossible to specify exactly which preprocessing steps were carried out.
