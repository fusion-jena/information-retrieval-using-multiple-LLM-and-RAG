4.1. Evaluation of fusion quality 

(1)  The  feature  dataset,  training  samples,  and  validation  samples 
were used as input into five base models to generate prediction 
results  (TKNN,  TRF,  TAdaBoost,  TXGBoost,  TLightGBM)  of  the  training 
samples  and  prediction  results  (VKNN,  VRF,  VAdaBoost,  VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM) of the validation samples.  

(2)  TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM  were combined in a 
column manner to obtain T, and VKNN, VRF, VAdaBoost, VXGBoost, 
VLightGBM were combined in a column manner to obtain V.  
(3)  Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the 
RF  algorithm  was  used  to  generate  the  prediction  results 
(α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of  training  data  T  by  5-fold  cross-validation. 
Stack (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) in rows to get A.

3.3. Feature selection 

This study used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation 
(RFECV) to select the optimal features that could reduce the redundancy 
caused  by  multi-source  feature  datasets  and  improve  model  perfor-
mance. RFECV is a wraparound approach to feature selection based on

(2)  The features with the lowest importance scores are removed from 
the  current  feature  combinations,  and  the  process  of  feature 
pruning  is  repeated  recursively  until  the  cross-validation  accu-
racy reaches the highest level. In the RFECV process, a five-fold 
cross-validation  was  used  to  select  the  number  and  combina-
tions of features.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection, which can help reduce redundancy caused by multi-source feature datasets and improve model performance. This technique involves removing features with the lowest importance scores recursively until the cross-validation accuracy reaches its highest level. It also uses a five-fold cross-validation to select the number and combinations of features. While this does not directly address data bias, it contributes to improving the overall quality of the dataset and potentially reducing any biases introduced through irrelevant or redundant features.
