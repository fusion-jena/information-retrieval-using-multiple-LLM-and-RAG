Ensemble modeling capitalizes on the strengths of multiple models to 
enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, 
provide  robustness  against  overfitting,  and  increase  model  interpret-
ability  (Ganaie  et  al.,  2022).  Combining  the  predictions  of  diverse 
models, ensemble modeling achieves more accurate and reliable results 
by  mitigating  the  risks  of  errors  and  biases,  resulting  in  stable  pre-
dictions that generalize well to unseen data (Ganaie et al., 2022). All the 
fitted models obtained from the five ML algorithms exhibited favorable 
performance measures. The AUC for all models surpassed 0.75, while 
the TSS exceeded 0.45. We used these results to build the final ensemble 
model,  employing  the  AUC-weighted  ensemble  method  (Achu  et  al., 
2021;  Tehrany  et  al.,  2019).  This  technique  utilizes  the  performance 
metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, ensuring

over different periods (Huesca et al., 2009). Data mining techniques are 
another empirical model employed to extract valuable information from 
large  datasets,  enabling  the  identification  of  hidden  patterns  and  re-
lationships  between  variables  related  to  forest  fires  (Pourtaghi  et  al., 
2016). Simulation models are used to recreate fire behavior and spread 
under various artificially set conditions. They help researchers and fire 
managers  understand  how  different  factors  influence  fire  dynamics 
(Kanga  and  Singh,  2017).  Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning 
models (MLM) make them capable of handling complex datasets and can 
offer valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the works, like 
Gaudreau et al. (2016) have taken one step forward by modeling the 
wildfire in future climatic scenarios. They are proven to be reliable and 
efficient  means  of  determining  the  relative  critical  attributes  from

various fire datasets (Sayad et al., 2019). In recent times, support vector 
machines (Jaafari and Pourghasemi, 2019), neural networks (Li et al., 
2020),  kernel  logistic  regression  are  benchmark  classifiers  (Tien  Bui 
et  al.,  2016),  and  hybrid  artificial  methods  (Jaafari  et  al.,  2019)  like 
random  forest  (Bustillo  S´anchez  et  al.,  2021;  Cao  et  al.,  2017)  have 
gained  popularity  in  fire  prediction  studies.  Other  emerging  machine 
learning models are also used globally to predict forest fire risk zonation 
(Abid, 2021). However, each MLM has several pros and cons; therefore, 
model ensembling is the second step in improving the predictive ability 
of forest fire susceptibility in large-scale studies (Gigovi´c et al., 2019; 
Tuyen et al., 2021). Ensemble approaches are often considered better 
than  single  models  because  they  improve  predictive  performance, 
reduce overfitting, and provide more robust and reliable results (Ganaie

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not mention any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of ensemble modeling in enhancing predictive accuracy, increasing stability, improving generalization, providing robustness against overfitting, and increasing model interpretability. It mentions using data mining techniques to extract valuable information from large datasets related to forest fires and simulation models to recreate fire behavior and spread under various conditions. Additionally, it highlights the use of machine learning models like support vector machines, neural networks, kernel logistic regression, random forests, and other emerging models to predict forest fire risk zonation. Model ensembling is mentioned as a way to improve the predictive ability of forest fire susceptibility in large-scale studies. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
