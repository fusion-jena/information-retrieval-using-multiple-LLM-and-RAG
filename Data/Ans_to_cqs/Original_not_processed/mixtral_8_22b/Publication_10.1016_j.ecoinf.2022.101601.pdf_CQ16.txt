3.3. Model pre-validation

3.4. Validation – expert assessment 

After  pre-validation,  the  model  moved  into  the  validation  stage. 
Here, validation first entailed meeting with a group of four experts at 
Texas A&M University to review the conceptual model and the results of 
the  prognostic  and  diagnostic  experiments.  This  validation  stage  is  a 
fairly unique attribute of the PermaBN model development process, as 
most  BN  studies  exclude  validation  from  the  development  process 
(Aguilera et al., 2011; Kaikkonen et al., 2021). Of the studies that do 
conduct validation, the most common method for doing so is through

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as validation loss plateau or other metrics. However, it mentions a validation stage involving expert assessment after pre-validation. In this case, the model was reviewed by a group of experts who evaluated the conceptual model and the results of prognostic and diagnostic experiments. This suggests that the completion of training might have been determined based on expert evaluation rather than traditional machine learning metrics like validation loss plateau. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding the training process and its termination criteria, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
