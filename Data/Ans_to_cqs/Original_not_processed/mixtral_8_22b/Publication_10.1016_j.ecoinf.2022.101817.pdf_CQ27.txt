Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
