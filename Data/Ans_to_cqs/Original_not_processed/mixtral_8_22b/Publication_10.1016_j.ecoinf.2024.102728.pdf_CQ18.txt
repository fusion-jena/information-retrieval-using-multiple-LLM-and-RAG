Where l1l3a is the average of all l3 capture values in l1 classes, l1s is
the l1 class number (1(cid:0) 32), c is the number of captured l1 classes by l3
classification. The lower-level classification (l3) is represented as an
element (∈) of the higher-level classification (l1). Next, all l1 classes
were sorted according to MI & LI, placed in l2 bins, and all l1l3a values
were averaged again within each l2 bin (Eq. 13). The bins represent the
l2 classes (n = 6) in MI and LI areas and are l2-oriented so that results can
be applied to landscape ecology. The l1 classes not skewed to either MI
or LI areas are included for both MI and LI bins as LTA (cid:0) LU0. Sorting
and averaging is represented as:
