When training a deep convolutional neural network, it is important to split the data
into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for optimizing the
parameters of the network, while the validation set is used for monitoring the performance
of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks
with, for example, different hyperparameters or network structures. The test set acts as a
ﬁnal evaluation of a network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and
the test set, samples in each set must be independent and have similar class distributions.
The full data set can be split in various ways. The naïve approach is to randomly
sample images from the full data set. However, due to the images being captured in
close proximity and potentially having overlapping ﬁelds of views, information may leak
between the data sets when using the naïve approach. Another approach would be to

Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

and polygons of each species in the respective data sets. A cluster consists of multiple images
acquired from the same location — potentially across multiple dates. An image contains zero, one, or
multiple annotations.

All networks were trained on the training set for 100 epochs, using the Adam opti-
mizer [27] with a learning rate of 0.001 and cross-entropy loss. The image batch size varied
from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution with larger batch sizes
for smaller image sizes. After each epoch, the network was evaluated on the validation
set. The epoch model with the highest accuracy on the validation set during training was
saved for further analysis. Before training the networks, the training set was balanced by
upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the
number of images of the most represented class, “No species”.

Helpful Answer:

When splitting the data for deep learning model training into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, several criteria are considered. Firstly, the training set is used for optimizing the parameters of the network, so it should contain enough examples to allow the model to learn effectively. Secondly, the validation set is used for monitoring the performance of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks with varying hyperparameters or network structures. Therefore, it should also include a representative sample of the data. Lastly, the test set serves as a final evaluation of the network, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. It should not overlap with either the training or validation sets and should ideally represent the distribution of the real-world data. Additionally, all three sets should maintain similar class distributions to prevent any bias towards certain classes. In this case, the full dataset was split such that samples in each set were independent and had similar class distributions.
