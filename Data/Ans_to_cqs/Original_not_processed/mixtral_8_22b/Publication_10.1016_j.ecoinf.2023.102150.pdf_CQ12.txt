We trained a deep neural network in R (R Core Team, 2022) using the 
R-package  keras  (Chollet  et  al.,  2017),  an  interface  to  TensorFlow 
(Abadi et al., 2015) for R. We used the ResNet50 architecture (for details 
about the model architecture see He et al., 2016) with an adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We trained the model from scratch for 55

Fig. 3. The camera trap developed by Soininen et al. (2015) consists of a Reconyx camera that is mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small 
mammals. The camera traps are protected with stones when placed in the field.

To overcome the challenge of manually processing huge amounts of 
data, artificial intelligence is increasingly used in ecology, for example 
to  automate  the  classification  of  camera  trap  images  (Christin  et  al., 
2019). Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning models that 
have proven to be especially useful for image recognition (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012) and have been applied for animal detection and classifi-
cation with great success (e.g. Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 
2019; Willi et al., 2019; Zualkernan et al., 2022). These models can for 
example separate empty images from images containing an animal (e.g. 
Beery et al., 2019), identify species, count individuals, and categorize 
animal behaviour with an accuracy that matches or even outperforms 
humans (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). However, developing and training 
neural  networks require  programming  skills  and  have  therefore  often

To our knowledge, our workflow is the first approach that gathers 
and  streamlines  all  steps  of  a  processing  pipeline  for  small  mammal 
camera trap images using automatic classification within one platform. 
Due to its flexibility, the workflow is especially well suited for adaptive 
monitoring programs (Likens and Lindenmayer, 2018; Ims and Yoccoz, 
2017), where monitoring targets, design and technologies are optimized 
over time. By providing R scripts, we also open the possibility for other 
ecologist to further develop the workflow and target it to their specific 
needs. Deep learning is a fast developing field (Minar and Naher, 2018) 
and as new methods, such as new model architectures, become avail-
able, they can be implemented to improve the workflow. In addition, we 
also provide R-shiny-apps, which are as flexible as R scripts, for the more 
time consuming steps of the work (quality check and correction of model

Query: "What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions that a deep neural network was trained using the ResNet50 architecture. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the ResNet50 variant. This information can be found in the second sentence of the given context.
