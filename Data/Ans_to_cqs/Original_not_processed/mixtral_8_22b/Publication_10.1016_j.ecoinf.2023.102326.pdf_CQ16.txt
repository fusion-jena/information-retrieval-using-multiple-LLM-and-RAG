Fig. 3. Average Shortest path length (ASPL) by daytime, grouped by land use type. Depicted are all 23 recording sites (Automatic Aural Devices (AAD)) and their 
respective ASPL diel cycle. ASPL values are centered on the mean to put emphasis on the individual course of ASPL. Blue color means that the value for the respective 
hour is above and red color that the value is below the mean. The mean of all ASPL values per site is given by a.

research approach is tailored towards the analysis of diel cycles, it was to 
be expected that the absolute values of the data may not provide a clear 
distinction between the LUMs of all locations being studied.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research paper does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss during training. When the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, this might indicate overfitting, and the training process can be stopped. Another commonly used criterion is setting a predefined number of epochs or iterations beforehand. In this study, since the authors do not discuss these details, we cannot definitively state what criteria they used to determine when training was complete.
