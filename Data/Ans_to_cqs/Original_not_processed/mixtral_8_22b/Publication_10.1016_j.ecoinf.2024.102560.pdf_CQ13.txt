Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

racy. Aksoy et al. (2022) analyzed the performance of three different 
machine-learning  algorithms  to  map  soil  salinity  for  the  Urmia  Lake 
basin  using  Landsat-8  OLI,  Sentinel-2A  satellite  images,  and  ground- 
based  EC  measurements.  The  output  soil  salinity  map  demonstrated 
the most reliable spatial distribution of various soil salinity classes in the 
selected study area.
