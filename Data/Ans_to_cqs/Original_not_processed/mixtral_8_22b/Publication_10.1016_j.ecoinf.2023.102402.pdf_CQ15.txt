goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the use of Maximum Entropy (Maxent) models and their evaluation using Akaike Information Criteria corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), which is a method for selecting the most parsimonious model among several candidates. In this case, the model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best model, and those with ΔAICc < 2 are also supported. This approach helps to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
