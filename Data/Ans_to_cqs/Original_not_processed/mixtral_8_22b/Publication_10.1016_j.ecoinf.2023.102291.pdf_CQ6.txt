for the customised architecture (see Convolutional neural networks sec-

compared,  namely,  a  customised  CNN  (based  on  preliminary  hyper- 
parameter tuning experiments), and a pre-trained ResNet152V2 archi-
tecture (He et al., 2016) that demonstrated good performance in animal 
sound classification tasks (Dufourq et al., 2022). The customised models 
were composed of three convolutional layers (32 filters, kernel size of 4 
× 4,  ReLU  activation).  Each  convolutional  layer  was  followed  by 

dropout (rate of 0.4) and a max pooling (kernel size of 4 × 4) layer. This 
was followed by a fully connected layer with 64 ReLU units, dropout 
(rate of 0.4), and a softmax function (two units in the case of CNN1, and 
three  or  four  units  in  the  case  of  CNN2  depending  on  the  number  of 
species). The models were trained for 50 epochs using the Adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch

validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision 
(number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives)

were  executed  on  Microsoft  Azure  using  instance  NV12s  v3  with  12 
vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The CNNs were implemented using Tensor-
Flow (Abadi et al., 2016) and Python 3. The Ubuntu 20.04 operating

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the models were built using a general pipeline (Fig. 3), which likely includes some form of preprocessing. Common preprocessing techniques for image datasets include normalization, resizing, augmentation, and noise reduction. For audio datasets like the one mentioned here, common preprocessing methods may involve converting raw audio files into spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), normalization, and splitting the data into smaller windows. Based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact preprocessing steps applied to the dataset; however, these are potential methods that could have been employed.
