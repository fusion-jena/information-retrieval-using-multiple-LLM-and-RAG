a  and  a  multitude  of  potentially  influential  factors  is  often  nonlinear  or  even  non-monotonic. 

Commonly used correlation analysis methods, such as the Pearson correlation, cannot accurately 

capture  these  complex  relationships.  To  address  this  deficiency,  MIC  analysis  is  often 

recommended  to  detect  both  linear  and  nonlinear  associations  between  two  variables  in  large 

datasets  (Reshef  et  al.,  2011).  MIC  has  been  extensively  used  to  select  candidate  predictors  for 

machine learning models (Su et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023;

larger the MIC value is. MIC scores greater than 0.3 between any given environmental factor and

comprehensive  strategy  to  elucidate  the  role  of  environmental  stressors  that  modulate 

phytoplankton  dynamics.  This  approach  advances  our  understanding  more  than  the  -often 

uncertain-  insights  gained  from  complex  overparameterized  mechanistic  models  (Baker  et  al., 

2018; Nelson et al., 2018; Arhonditsis et al., 2007; 2019a,b). ML techniques capable of identifying 

generalizable  non-linear  patterns  have  been  successful  in  predicting  chlorophyll-a  (Chl  a),  a 

commonly used proxy for algal biomass and a direct indicator to evaluate the ecological state of 

inland  waters.  Among  the  ML  methods,  Random  Forest  (RF)  modeling  emerges  as  a  popular 

ensemble learning method to examine complex relationships, known for its resilience to data noise,
