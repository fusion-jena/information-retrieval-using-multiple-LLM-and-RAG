TABLE 3. Classification performance of different methods using single
CNN-based model. Here, Mel-CNN, Harm-CNN, and Perc-CNN denote that
the input to those CNNs are Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component
based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram.
Subnet-CNN denotes that a SubSpectralNet architecture is used with the
Mel-spectrogram as the input.

The duration of audio ﬁles in CLO-43DS data is different,
which cannot be directly used as the input to the CNN. The
ﬁrst method for dealing with the multi-variate varying length
audio data is that the signal is repeated from the beginning to
force the ﬁxed duration of 2s, which has been used in [30].
The second method is to directly resize the audio image to a
ﬁxed size.

D. DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE
The feature learning part of our proposed model follows a
VGG style network [24], which has been previously used
for classifying acoustic scenes [5]. The overall architec-
ture is illustrated in Table 1. This network is trained using
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10−4. The cate-
gorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The
batch size is 64 samples and the network is trained with
200 epochs.

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is important to evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help in understanding how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. This helps in identifying any biases or imbalances in the dataset.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most to the output prediction. They provide insights into what features the model focuses on while making its decisions.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may also involve tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, regularization parameters, etc. to improve the performance of the model further.

In the given context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps after model training. However, some papers mentioned in the references discuss evaluation metrics and techniques like saliency maps. For example, paper [22] mentions fusing shallow and deep learning models for bird species classification and evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Similarly, paper [24] uses very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition and employs techniques like saliency maps for visualizing the learned representations. Therefore, based on these references, we can infer that postprocessing steps like model evaluation, confusion matrices, saliency maps, and hyperparameter tuning could potentially be applied after model training in this scenario.
