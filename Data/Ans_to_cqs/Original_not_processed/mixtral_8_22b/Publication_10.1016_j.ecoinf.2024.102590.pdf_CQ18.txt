The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

low, a completely random sampling protocol produced an unbalanced 
training set and resulted in the misclassification of smaller woody plants 
(i.e., shrubs). To address this issue, we created a separate geometry, ‘add 
trees’ (LC property = 2), whereby well-defined examples of woody cover 
elements  were  added  until  the  two  classes  had  the  same  number  of 
training points. This new geometry was then merged with the randomly 
allocated  woody points, ‘woody’  (LC  property = 2) + ‘add trees’  (LC 
property = 2) = ‘merged woody’, as they are part of the same land cover 
class. To assess model accuracy, we then randomly separated 80/20% of 
the classified points to generate a training/validation dataset to be used 
later in the accuracy assessments.

Helpful Answer:
To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a strategy involving the creation of several small sampling plots within each vegetation type rather than using one large area. This approach aimed to ensure that the training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. They determined the size of these sampling plots by calculating 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and dividing it by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary.

Furthermore, to prevent the misclassification of smaller woody plants, such as shrubs, due to an unbalanced training set resulting from a completely random sampling protocol, the authors introduced a separate geometry called 'add trees.' This geometry included well-defined examples of woody cover elements until both classes had the same number of training points. Subsequently, this new geometry was merged with the randomly allocated woody points, forming a single class named'merged woody.'

Finally, to evaluate the model's accuracy, the authors randomly split the classified points into an 80/20% ratio to create a training/validation dataset. This dataset would later be utilized in the accuracy assessments.
