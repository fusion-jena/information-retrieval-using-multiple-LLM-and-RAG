of CNN architectures, and adjust network layers and hyperparameters to 
predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. More-
over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms.

Water quality monitoring in inland lakes is crucial to ensuring the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. For 
regional  water  environment  agencies  and  researchers,  remote  sensing  offers  a  cost-effective  alternative  to 
traditional in-situ water sampling methods. In this study, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
based on AlexNet to represent the relationship between Sentinel-2 images and in situ water quality levels of Lake 
Dianchi from November 2020 to April 2023. The model incorporated an algal bloom extraction algorithm and 
utilized correlation analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and random forest (RF) method to establish connec-
tions between two environmental factors: water quality and meteorology, to the area of algal bloom (AAB). The 
findings  revealed an  improvement  in Lake  Dianchi's water  quality, with  Levels  A (good water  quality) and B

distribution of algal blooms, this study leverages remote sensing data in 
conjunction  with  CNNs,  applying  the  AlexNet  architecture  to  water 
quality classification to address the challenges posed by the heteroge-
neous water conditions in Lake Dianchi. Additionally, our research is 
distinguished  by  its  integration  of  a  broader  range  of  environmental 
factors, including both meteorological and water quality parameters, to 
assess their collective impact on algal bloom formation. This multifac-
eted analysis offers a more nuanced understanding compared to Wang 

et al. (2021c), who primarily focused on the response relationship be-
tween  algal  blooms  and  environmental  factors,  providing  a  more 
detailed insight.

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does provide insights into how deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be used for water quality monitoring and predicting algal blooms in inland lakes like Lake Dianchi.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results, or employing techniques like dropout regularization to reduce overfitting caused by randomness during training. These strategies help ensure consistent and reliable performance despite inherent randomness in the process.

While these strategies aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, they are commonly used best practices when working with deep learning models. It's important to note that each strategy has its own trade-offs and should be chosen based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem being addressed.
