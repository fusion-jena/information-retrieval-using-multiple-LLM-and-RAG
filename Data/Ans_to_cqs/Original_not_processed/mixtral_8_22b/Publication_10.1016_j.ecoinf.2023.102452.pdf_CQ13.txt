specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, and regularization parameters such as dropout or weight decay. Learning rate determines how much the weights should be updated during training, while the optimizer specifies which optimization algorithm to use for updating the weights. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before the model updates its internal parameters, while epochs refer to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training. Regularization parameters help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model's complexity. Without more specific details about the deep learning model being used, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used.
