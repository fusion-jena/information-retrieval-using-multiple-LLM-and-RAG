◦

The study area extends from 78
◦
30′ to 6

◦
58′ west longitude, and
06′ to 78
◦
02′ south latitude, covering 2904.96 km2, has elevations from
5
351 to 3684 m.a.s.l. and encompasses the Alto Mara˜n´on II and III inter-
basins, as well as the lower Utcubamba river basin, as shown in Fig. 1.
This area was chosen as a case study because it is currently the most
affected sector by the cultivation of rice, coffee, cocoa, and extensive
livestock farming in the aforementioned watersheds of the Amazonas
and Cajamarca regions,
located in the northwest Peru (Gobierno
Regional de Amazonas (GOREA) and Instituto de Investigaciones de la
Amazonía Peruana (IIAP), 2007; Gobierno Regional de Cajamarca
(GRC), 2010MIDAGRI, 2021).

2.3.4. Sampling size and validation areas

On this occasion, to define the training and testing samples, we relied
on Chuvieco (2020), who argues that for categorical variables, at least
196 test points should be considered. Furthermore, Chuvieco (2020),
also mentions that, at times, this number can be very small when
compared to the total number of pixels in the image. Therefore, we
explored new sampling strategies that combine the previous scientific
foundation with the current capabilities of GEE.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only provides details about the study area, datasets, spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, cluster, and land use/land cover classes. There is no mention of any specific cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
