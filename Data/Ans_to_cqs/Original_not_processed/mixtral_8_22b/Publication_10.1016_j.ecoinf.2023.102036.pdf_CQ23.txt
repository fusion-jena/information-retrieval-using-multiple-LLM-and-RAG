Each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch 
size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar 
photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iter-

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts were made to address the limitations of the dataset size and improve the model's performance.

Firstly, the authors mention that they exploited existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome the limitation in the dataset size. This suggests that they may have employed methods like data augmentation, transfer learning, or other strategies to enhance the diversity and richness of their dataset.

Secondly, the authors describe an optimization process involving parameter tuning to find the best values for various hyperparameters, including input size, learning rate, momentum, SD threshold, and search interval. By fine-tuning these parameters, the researchers aimed to achieve better performance and potentially increase the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Lastly, the use of TensorBoard, a toolset for visualizing and analyzing machine learning models, indicates that the researchers monitored the performance of their model during training and validation. While this does not directly relate to ensuring generalizability, it shows that the team paid attention to evaluating their model's progress and making informed decisions based on its performance metrics.

In conclusion, although the text does not explicitly state the use of common techniques for improving generalizability, such as employing a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it implies that the researchers took steps to mitigate the impact of limited dataset size and optimize their model's performance.
