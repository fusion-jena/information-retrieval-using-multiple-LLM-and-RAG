2.4.1. Random forest classification

Including seasonal images as input  variables  for machine  learning 
classification  models  was  found  as  the  most  effective  approach  to 
maximize  the  classification  accuracy  in  many  environments,  such  as 
forests (Pratic`o et al., 2021; Zhu and Liu, 2014), grasslands (Esch et al., 
2014) and Mediterranean rural areas (Senf et al., 2015). Previous studies 
analyzing the intra-annual variations in seagrass meadows distribution 
suggested that these communities display large fluctuations in biomass 
and species cover over seasons (Fauzan et al., 2021; Menu et al., 2021; 
Roelfsema et al., 2013; Zoffoli et al., 2020). Therefore, the inclusion of 
the seasonality might greatly improve the accuracy of seagrass in clas-
sification models. This translates into a probable reduction of the clas-
sification noise due to other environmental factors (e.g., algae blooms, 
water turbidity) (Acquavita et al., 2015; Christia et al., 2018; LÃ¸nborg

improvements in discriminative capabilities of supervised classification 
algorithms may result from the inclusion of multisource data, such as 
environmental  data  that  characterize  the  ecology  of  these  species  or 
other remote sensing sources.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of'seasonal images' as input variables for machine learning classification models. This suggests that one of the data formats used could be images. Additionally, the mention of'multisource data' implies that there might be other types of data used, but without further context, we cannot definitively determine what those data formats might be.
