A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning-based model for
processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern [60]. The model is developed
in such a way that the algorithm learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features by
itself from the lower to the higher levels of the pattern. Mathematically, it is composed of
three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature
extraction is conducted using the ﬁrst two layers and mapping the extracted features to the
output is conducted by the third layer.

Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better
accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including
ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized
in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better ﬁt the occurrence scenarios of the
species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including
MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS.
The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve
(AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68
with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for
species distribution over BIOCLIM.

modelling approaches and the increased number of datasets has made this model one of
the most globally accepted SDMs. There is a growing concern for the establishment of the
nonlinear relationship between the bioclimatic parameters through innovative approaches
such as deep learning-based models. It has been observed that the BIOCLIM model is
overestimates the species distribution and the higher probability of species occurrence at
the higher altitude. Moreover, it has been observed that the distribution pattern of the
predicted Rhododendron arboreum distribution using CNN architecture is quite different at
some places than from conventional BIOCLIM models. The current work proposed deep
learning-based CNN architecture for probability distribution modelling and proved to
perform better than the traditional BIOCLIM model. There was an underestimation of
species distribution observed in CNN than BIOCLIM. The distribution probability in CNN

Convolution is used for feature extraction, in which a kernel is applied to an input
tensor. A feature map is thus obtained through the product of kernel elements and tensor
input. The procedure is then repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. The hyperparameters involved in convolution
operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to
5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the model is likely being used for classification tasks. This is because the model is described as having three main components - convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers - which are commonly used in deep learning architectures for image classification tasks. Additionally, the model is said to have been trained on ecological and atmospheric variables, suggesting that its goal may be to classify these inputs into categories related to species distribution patterns. Furthermore, the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric also suggests that the model is being used for binary classification tasks, as AUC is often used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model is not specified, it appears to be primarily intended for classification tasks related to species distribution modeling.
