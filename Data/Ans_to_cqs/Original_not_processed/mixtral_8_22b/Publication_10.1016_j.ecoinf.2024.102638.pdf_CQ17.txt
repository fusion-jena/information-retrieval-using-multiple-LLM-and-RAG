The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

in-
frastructures  is  very  valuable,  they  are  costly  and  resource  intensive. 
Also, at the operational level, the mathematical treatment of the data is 
sometimes complex and requires very specific techniques and method-
ologies, as for example, gap-filling (Shi et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2021). 
Recent  advances  in  machine  learning  have  enabled  many  technical 
barriers to be overcome in this area, creating many opportunities and 
challenges  that  were  unapproachable  in  the  past  (Huntingford  et  al., 
2019;  Tang  and  Li,  2023).  Machine  learning  (ML)  algorithms  have 
advanced exponentially in recent years, leading to breakthroughs, and 
more  recently  aiding  climate  analysis  applications  (Citakoglu  and 
Cos¸kun, 2022; Reichstein et al., 2019). Although there has been much 
discussion and debate in the scientific community about the effective-
ness  and  suitability  of  machine/deep  learning  techniques  to  help

cases with nonlinear relationships. For their part, SVR and GP are slow 
to train and scale greatly with increasing amounts of data. Decision trees 
tend to perform worse than other models. KNN can be sensitive to noisy 
data and outliers, and since it needs to store the data in memory, it can 
be computationally expensive with large amounts of data. And XGBoost 
and  Random  Forest  can  be  prone  to  overfitting  depending  on  the  se-
lection of their hyperparameters.

Helpful Answer:
In the given context, although the focus is primarily on various machine learning models such as KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, MLP, and their respective parameters, there isn't explicit mention of regularization methods used specifically in deep learning pipelines like dropout or L2 regularization. However, we can infer from some parameter names mentioned that certain forms of regularization might be employed.

For instance, 'alpha', often associated with Ridge Regression, is a form of L2 regularization where the penalty term is proportional to the sum of squares of all feature weights. Similarly, 'l1_ratio' suggests the use of Lasso Regularization, which uses absolute values instead of squared values in its penalty term. Both these methods help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the optimization problem during model training.

Moreover,'max_depth','min_samples_split','min_samples_leaf', and'max_features' are parameters related to decision tree-based models (like TREE, RF, XGB), which control the complexity of the learned trees, thereby acting as a form of regularization against overfitting.

However, it should be noted that these aren't exactly equivalent to dropout or L2 regularization used explicitly in deep learning architectures. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to small changes in input features. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, discouraging large weight values and thus reducing overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, while we see evidence of regularization being applied through various means, direct application of dropout or L2 regularization as typically seen in deep learning pipelines isn't explicitly discussed.
