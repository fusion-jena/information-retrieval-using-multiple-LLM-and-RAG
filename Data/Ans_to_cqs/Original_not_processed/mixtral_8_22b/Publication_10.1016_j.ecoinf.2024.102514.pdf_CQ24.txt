2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during development and experimentation. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code is executed. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results to reduce variance caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can help mitigate the effects of randomness in neural networks. Lastly, it is important to carefully design experiments and interpret results while considering the inherent stochasticity of deep learning algorithms.
