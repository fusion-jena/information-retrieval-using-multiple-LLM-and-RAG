Surface area as a share of each bioregion (ID) for every SRI category for each of the three grid sizes (R1= ∼ 1
). Values show the surface area as 
a share of each bioregion for every SRI category (see §2.2.1). ID is the identification number given to each bioregion (Table 1). H are cells with a high representativeness 
of species richness (i.e. SRI > 0.85). M are cells considered as having a medium representativeness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0.60, 0.85)). L cells are cells with a low number of records 
and are thus not considered to be representative of actual species richness (i.e. SRI ∈ (0, 0.6)). NR as cells with no records (SRI = NA), and IR as cell with insufficient 
records to apply SRI.

Files of the 10,371 marine fish species and their attributes (body size, habitat depth, and cultural value) from FishBase may be found in the GitHub 

project page of this manuscript: http://github.com/vapizarro/stp_fishes 

Appendix B. Species representativeness analysis (SRI) 

For each cell (i), the SRI is the simple ratio between the observed number of species Sobs and the expected number of species (Sobs): SRIi = Sobs/Sexp. 

Maps for the smallers resolution analyzed (∼ 1

) are in Fig. A.2.

Fig. A.1. Classification of SRI values based on its frequency distribution. This histogram displays the frequency distribution of SRI (Species Richness Index) values 
and the corresponding class selection thresholds. Cells are categorized as follows: SRI < 0.6 are classified as low representativeness (L), SRI falling in the range (0.6, 
0.85) as medium representativeness (M), and SRI > 0.85 as high representativeness (H).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in the provided context. The context only includes data related to marine fish species and their attributes, such as body size, habitat depth, and cultural value, along with some calculations regarding species richness index (SRI) for different regions. There is no mention of any machine learning or deep learning models being used, let alone the specific hyperparameters employed in those models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query based on the available information.
