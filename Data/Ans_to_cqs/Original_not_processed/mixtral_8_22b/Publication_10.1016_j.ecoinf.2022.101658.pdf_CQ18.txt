collected at three field sites: Pelican Moun-
tain  (PM),  Calling  Lake  (CL)  and  Conklin 
(CK). Manual classification of fuel types used 
in  semantic  segmentation  training  and 
testing were limited to data collected at PM 
and  CL.  Field  measurement  data  and  raw 
photos  from  the  CK  field  site  were  used 
solely for independent validation. R refers to

similar  than  distant  ones  (Tobler,  1970).  The  standard  solution  is  to 
place  samples  sufficiently  apart  from  one  another.  Unfortunately,  to 
ensure test data had ecological conditions representative of the training 
data,  it  was  necessary  to  draw  these  data  from  the  same  plots  as  the 
training  data.  We  considered  this  approach  acceptable  in  our  case 
because the forest floor conditions in our plots were heterogenous over 
very small distances (i.e., millimeters to centimeters) and photos spaced 
just 5 m apart could have very different proportionate representations of 
cover types. Given the area included in each training and testing photo 
was  completely  independent  and  the  distance  between  photos  was 
relatively large (i.e., 20,000 pixels), we expect spatial autocorrelation 
between training and testing data likely was minimal.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible strategies include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or loss function values during training epochs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or early stopping might be employed to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
