A. ACCURACY COMPARISONS OF BENCHMARK
NETWORK MODELS
Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy
and practicability of the proposed method. For the quantita-
tive analysis of the models, we ﬁrst compared state-of-the-art
deep learning backbone models, such as Inception-ResNet-
v2 [27], Inception-v3 [28], Xception [32], ResNet101 [29],
and MobileNetV2 [33]. Fig. 5 lists the classiﬁcation accura-
cies achieved by the learning models.

Inception-ResNet-v2 was found to consistently outperform
the other existing learning networks by attaining 100% train-
ing accuracy, 97.47% validation accuracy, and 97.11% test
accuracy.

C. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The performance of the trained models in identifying individ-
ual bird species was evaluated using three standard metrics:

• TP is the true positive, indicating the number of birds

correctly detected as endemic birds.

• TN is the true negative, indicating the number of birds

correctly detected as nonendemic birds.

• FP is the false positive, indicating the number of birds

incorrectly detected as endemic birds.

• FN is the false negative, indicating the number of ground

truth birds undetected by the predictive system.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
To extract the relevant features of birds, we randomly split
the endemic bird data into 3,132 images for training and
760 images for testing. To allow the deep networks to con-
verge and improve the ability of the model to generalize
adeptly, we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting
in a total of 31,320 images. Then, 25,056 (80%) images were
used for training and 6,264 (20%) were used for validation.
The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm with the batch size set to
32 and the learning rate maintained at 0.0001. The Adam
optimizer was used to ﬁne-tune the model with the following
parameters:

• Exponential decay rate of ﬁrst-moment estimation

of 0.9.

Helpful Answer:
Three standard metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in identifying individual bird species: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the model in correctly detecting endemic and nonendemic birds. However, it should be noted that these metrics do not directly provide information on the overall accuracy, precision, or recall of the model. Instead, they focus specifically on the classification results for each category (endemic vs. nonendemic birds).

For more specific details about the accuracy comparison between different benchmark network models, including Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet101, and MobileNetV2, please refer to Figure 5 and its accompanying description in section A. This will give you insights into how well each model performs in terms of training, validation, and test accuracies.

As mentioned earlier, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model was found to achieve the highest accuracy among all tested models, reaching 100% training accuracy, 97.47% validation accuracy, and 97.11% test accuracy.
