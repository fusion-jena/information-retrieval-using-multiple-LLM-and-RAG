the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of 
DeeplabV3+ (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) with 
the COCO dataset. COCO is a dataset that has 121,408 images and a total 
of 883,331 object annotations divided in 184 classes. COCO is a widely 
used  dataset  to  train  computer  vision  models  and  sets  a  baseline  to 
benchmark their performance. Since we want to derive common objects 
below the skyline, we inference without training the model directly on 
the landscape photos. A typical example of the masks obtained with such 
a semantic segmentation is provided in Fig. 3.

Helpful Answer:
The text mentions two main datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for semantic segmentation tasks. The first one is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains over 121,000 images and 883,000 labeled objects across 184 categories. It is a popular benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of computer vision algorithms. The second dataset mentioned is the Harmonized Land Cover and Use Database for Field Surveys from 2006 to 2018 in the European Union, also known as the Lucas In-Situ dataset. This dataset provides information about land cover and use throughout Europe and can be useful for various applications related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring.
