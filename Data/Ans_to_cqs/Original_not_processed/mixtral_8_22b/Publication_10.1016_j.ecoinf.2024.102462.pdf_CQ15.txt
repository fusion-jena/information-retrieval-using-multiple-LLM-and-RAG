In order to solve this problem, we used a DL approach. DL networks 
can be seen as non-linear functions with a large number of parameters. 
The parameters of each DL are adjusted using annotated data (usually 
referred  to  as  a  “supervised  approach”).  Once  this  process  (called 
training the network) is finished, the evaluation of the network on the real 
problem  is  performed  by  feeding  it  an  independent  data  set  not  seen 
during training (the testing data set). DL techniques are currently a hot 
topic in machine learning with applications in a variety of fields, and are 
considered the current state of the art for CV applications. In fact, in 
some disciplines, this technology is considered to have exceeded human 
capabilities (Buetti-Dinh et al., 2019; He et al., 2015).

1.  ResNet (He et al., 2016): The innovation of this approach supposed a 
breakthrough  for  convolutional  neural  networks  becoming  the 
winner of the ILSVRC challenge in 2015. By introducing the concept 
of residual connections between blocks, the arbitrary limit of stacked 
consecutive blocks caused by problems in the optimisation process 

was  lifted  and  these  connections  virtually  granted  researchers  the 
ability to have an infinite number of parameters and depth. In fact, 
residual  connections  have  become  a  staple  of  DL  and  are  still 
currently used in any modern architecture.

the  experts.  Then  the  network  is  fed  this  annotated  data  and  the  pa-
rameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. 
Once this training process is finished, the model is ready to process new 
unseen  data.  DL  networks  are,  thus,  able  to  capture  statistics  and  re-
lationships directly from the data following human expertise. If the data 
used  for  training  the  model  is  representative  of  the  problem  and  the 
annotations are carefully generated, the resulting network can perform 
at a similar level with any input data set. This capacity to translate the 
training to other independent datasets is called the generalization power 
of the network. In practice, differences in performance between the re-
sults with the training data (or data that is similar to it, i.e., from the 
same  site  and  acquired  at  the  same  time)  and  those  of  independent 
datasets (often in research papers referred to as the testing data set) can

To  evaluate  current  advancements  in  the  field,  we  compared  the 
ResNet network to three newer architectures with either new processing 
blocks  (i.e.  self-attention)  or  improved  parameter  optimisation  and 
modern network design. Even though it is considered the current state of 
the art in image classification, the ViT network failed to improve on the 
results of ResNet. Nonetheless, a different transformer-based approach, 
the  Swin  network,  and  a  ResNet  evolution,  ConvNeXt,  clearly  out-
performed ResNet with around a 5% improvement: 77.18% and 76.20% 
accuracy, respectively.

Helpful Answer:
While the given text does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it does discuss the use of optimization processes in Deep Learning (DL) networks. During the training phase of DL networks, the parameters of the model are adjusted based on an optimization process. This process involves minimizing the loss function, which measures how well the model performs during training. Common optimization techniques used in DL include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and others. However, without explicit information about the optimization technique used in the mentioned DL approaches like ResNet, it cannot be definitively stated which one was employed.
