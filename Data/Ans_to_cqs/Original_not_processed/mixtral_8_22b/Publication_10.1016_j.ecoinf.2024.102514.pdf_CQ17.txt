The  development  and  evaluation  of  ML/AI  models  have  become 
central to many domains, ranging from healthcare and finance to natural 
language processing and computer vision (de Hond et al., 2022; Krenn 
et al., 2023). Accurately assessing the performance and generalization 
capability of these models is of paramount importance. To achieve this, 
data  scientists  and  researchers  rely  on  a  plethora  of  validation  tech-
niques,  like  holdout  method,  bootstrapping,  leave-one-out  cross-vali-
dation, nested cross-validation among which cross-validation stands as a 
cornerstone (Tsamardinos et al., 2018; Wainer and Cawley, 2021; Wong, 
2015).  Cross-validation  is  a  systematic  approach  to  model  evaluation 
that has gained widespread popularity due to its robustness and versa-
tility (Bates et al., 2023; Nunez et al., 2021). It is particularly valuable 
when dealing with limited datasets, where overfitting and underfitting

Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Two commonly used regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons. This results in a more robust model that performs better on unseen data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and encourages smaller ones. By doing so, it prevents any single feature from having too much influence on the output, thus reducing overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and stopping the process once the error starts increasing. Weight decay is similar to L2 regularization but decays the weights exponentially instead of adding a penalty term. Lastly, batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, making the optimization process easier and faster, thereby preventing overfitting.
