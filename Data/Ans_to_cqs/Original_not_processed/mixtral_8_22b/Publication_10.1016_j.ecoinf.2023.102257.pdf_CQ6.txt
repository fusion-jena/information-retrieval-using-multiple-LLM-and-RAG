2.1. Objective 1: perform tagging efficiency experiment

Remote cameras (“trail cameras”) are a popular tool for non-invasive, continuous wildlife monitoring, and as 
they  become  more  prevalent  in  wildlife  research,  machine  learning  (ML)  is  increasingly used  to  automate  or 
accelerate  the  labor-intensive  process  of  labelling  (i.e.,  tagging)  photos.  Human-machine  hybrid  tagging  ap-
proaches have been shown to greatly increase tagging efficiency (i.e., time to tag a single image). However, those 
potential increases hinge on the extent to which an ML model makes correct vs. incorrect predictions. We per-
formed an experiment using a ML model that produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in 
remote camera imagery (MegaDetector) to consider the impact of a ML model’s performance on its ability to 
accelerate human labeling. Six participants tagged trail camera images collected from 12 sites in Vermont and

Maine, USA (January–September 2022) using three tagging methods (one with ML bounding box assistance and 
two  without  assistance).  We  used  a  generalized  linear  mixed  model  to  examine  the  influence  of  ML  model 
performance  and  tagging  method  on  tagging  efficiency.  We  found  that  ML  bounding  boxes  offer  significant 
improvement in tagging efficiency when labelling data compared to unassisted tagging. Additionally, the time 
taken to label with bounding boxes was not statistically different from an unassisted tagging approach. However, 
we  found  that  gains  in  efficiency  are  contingent  on  the  ML  algorithm’s  performance  and  that  incorrect  ML 
predictions, particularly the 4.2% false positive and 3.6% false negative predictions, can slow the tagging process 
compared to a non-hybrid approach. These findings indicate that although practitioners usually forgo the pro-

Additionally, if we consider the use of ML models as a pre-filtering 
method  for  removing  blank  images,  the  effective  time  required  for 
tagging  false  negatives  becomes  zero,  and  ML-assisted  tagging  with 
bounding  boxes  could  be  even  faster  than  tagging  without  bounding 
boxes. However, the increased efficiency from using a ML model to pre- 
filter  empty  images  would  come  at  a  cost  (e.g.,  in  our  application  of 
MegaDetector, throwing away the 3.6% of false negatives predicted to

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as MegaDetector. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling numeric variables so they fall within a specified range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to bring them to similar scales, reducing the risk of certain features dominating others during model training. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, and other anomalies that may affect model performance. While these preprocessing steps are generally applicable, it is important to note that the exact preprocessing techniques employed will depend on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the specific deep learning task.
