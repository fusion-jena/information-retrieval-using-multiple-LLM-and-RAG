Input 

The input layer of UODN performs preprocessing operations on the 
initial images. Preprocessing operations include resizing the images to 
the  required  size  and  applying  algorithms  such  as  mosaic  data 
augmentation. These preprocessing steps make the distribution of the 
input  data  more  uniform  and  enhance  the  ability  of  the  model  to 
represent  the  data,  thereby improving  the  model  performance  during 
training.

However,  using  large  kernel  convolutions  usually  leads  to  over-
whelming computational complexity, resulting in a sharp increase in the 
number  of  network  parameters  and  network  computational  load.  To 
overcome this issue, we used dilated convolution (Yu and Koltun, 2016) 
and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations. Dilated 
convolution can increase the receptive field of the convolution kernel by 
inserting “holes”  without adding parameters or increasing the compu-
tational load. The equation for calculating the receptive field of dilated 
convolution  is  shown  in  Eq.  (4),  where  n  represents  the  size  of  the 
receptive field and d represents the dilation rate.

Owing to the insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, gen-
eral deep learning networks have difficulty capturing accurate feature 
information and cannot detect objects correctly. The original YOLOv8 
network  uses  the  C2f  module  for  feature  extraction.  However,  this 
module employs an split  operation on features after convolution. This 
operation divides the input data into two non-overlapping parts, making 
it  difficult  to  obtain  comprehensive  and  rich  feature  information 
through half of the channel’s features. Specifically, the shape of features 
F obtained after convolution is ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch 
size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height 
and width, respectively. The split  operation evenly divides F  into two 
parts on the channel dimension with shapes of ℝN×H×W×0.5C, and these 
two parts do not overlap. The original YOLOv8 convolves only half of

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use several techniques to improve the quality and representation of their input data during the preprocessing stage of their deep learning pipeline. However, none of these techniques specifically addresses data bias through methods like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, they focus on enhancing the overall quality of the input data.

Specifically, the authors mention performing preprocessing operations on initial images, including resizing them to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. Resizing the images ensures consistency in the dimensions of the input data, which helps maintain uniformity across different samples. Data augmentation techniques, like mosaic augmentation, help generate new training examples from existing ones by combining multiple images together. This process increases the diversity of the dataset and improves the robustness of the trained models.

Additionally, the authors discuss using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to overcome issues related to overwhelming computational complexity when employing large kernel convolutions. By incorporating these techniques, they aim to reduce the number of network parameters and computational load while still maintaining a larger receptive field for the convolutional kernels.

Overall, while the authors do not explicitly mention addressing data bias through specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, they do emphasize the importance of enhancing the quality and representation of input data during preprocessing.
