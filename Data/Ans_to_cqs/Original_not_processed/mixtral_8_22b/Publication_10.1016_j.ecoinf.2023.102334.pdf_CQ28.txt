6.1. Vision transformer 

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is a deep neural network 
first created for natural language processing (NLP), was built on a self- 
attention mechanism that makes it possible for noticeably huge recep-
tive  fields.  The Transformer  has become  a  de facto industry  standard 
procedure in NLP because of its remarkable efficiency, and it has also 
motivated  researchers  in  the  field  of  computer  vision  to  investigate 
applications  by  utilizing  the  long-term  relationships  between  pixels 
(Khan et al., 2022).

In the above formula, the number of samples in a batch, the number 
of sample classes, the cosine factor, the cosine interval, the angle be-
tween the feature and the target weight, the angle between the feature, 
and the non-target weight are all denoted by the letters n, C, s, m, θyi , 
and θj, respectively. The network can concentrate its expressive power to

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any explicit information about the specific cloud platform or deployment environment used for the deep learning models mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they were deployed using platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
