3.5.3. Artificial neural network 

ANNs are used for modelling complex phenomena and developing 
nonlinear regression (Haykin and Lippmann, 1994). It consists of three 
different  layers:  input,  hidden,  and  output  (Ingram  et  al., 2005).  The 
ANN uses calibration parameters, such as the learning rate and weight, 
to improve the results. The weights were randomly initialized using the 
Nguyen–Widrow method (Zhou et al., 2016). An ANN fitted with CARET 
is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size 
and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regular-
isation parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 
1–20  and  0.025–1,  respectively.  The  Transfer/Activation  function  for 
the  model was  selected  as  the  logistic  function.  The  optimum  combi-
nation of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy.

3.5.2. Support vector machine

The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily being used for nonlinear regression modeling. Specifically, they are employed to predict Above Ground Biomass (AGB) by utilizing remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites.

Three different types of deep learning models have been discussed in the context: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each of these models serves a specific purpose within the broader goal of accurately estimating AGB.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): These are used for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regressions. In this case, ANNs are utilized to create a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size and decay. The size refers to the number of units in the hidden layer, while decay is a regularization parameter aimed at preventing overfitting. The ultimate objective is to find the optimal combination of parameters that yields the most accurate model fit.

Random Forest (RF): This algorithm is known for its ability to handle large datasets and provide accurate information about critical factors. Its primary use here is to generate predictions for AGB. However, it does come with some limitations, such as increased model complexity when dealing with numerous predictors and the potential for overfitting if parameters like'mtry' and 'ntree' aren't appropriately adjusted. To mitigate these issues, this study systematically evaluates'mtry' values ranging from 1 to 10, striving to achieve a balance between stability and minimal Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Support Vector Machine (SVM): While no explicit details are provided about the role of SVM in this context, it is generally used for classification and regression tasks. Given that both ANNs and RF are employed for nonlinear regression, it can be inferred that SVM might serve a similar purpose in this scenario.

Overall, the main purpose of these deep learning models is to develop robust and accurate nonlinear regression models capable of predicting AGB using satellite imagery data.
