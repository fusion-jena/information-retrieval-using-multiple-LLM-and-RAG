The performance of machine learning models was evaluated by four 
criteria:  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  NSE  (Nash  and  Sutcliffe, 
1970), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correla-
tion coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024).

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the machine learning models mentioned. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum threshold for accuracy or other performance metrics, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or meeting a predefined number of iterations or epochs. These criteria can vary depending on the model type, dataset size, and desired level of precision. In this case, we cannot definitively state which criteria were used without additional context.
