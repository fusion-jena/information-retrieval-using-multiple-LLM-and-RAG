stochastic process mainly valued in a Hilbert space. Statistical methods 
for functional data have received a lot of attention from the scientific 
community  (Ramsay  and  Silverman,  2005;  Silverman  and  Ramsay, 
2002) over the last decade. Li et al. (2022) and Koner and Staicu (2023) 
reviewed recently some of the fundamental concepts of the FDA, their 
recent advances, and their impact on practical cases. FDA is an alter-
native to the use of diverse and heterogeneous datasets (Pauthenet et al., 
2017, 2019) of functional, shape or more complex structure. Here we 
studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the 
pelagic environment to take advantage of all the information available 
in the data. Previous work by Diogoul et al. (2020), among others, has 
been  done  on  aggregated  features  from  the  original  data.  Classical

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned are related to various studies and research papers but do not explicitly state the location of the data repository. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
