sensing data and water quality parameters across all freshwater bodies. 
Additionally,  the  availability  of  comprehensive  and  representative 
datasets for model training is a persistent challenge. The ability to obtain 
sufficient and high-quality data from a wide range of reservoirs is often 
limited by logistical and financial constraints. This scarcity of data can 
hinder the development of robust and generalized models.

patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b;

scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including

Helpful Answer:
In the field of freshwater ecology, remote sensing data and water quality parameters are commonly used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, Hong et al. (2022) used hyperspectral imagery to estimate cyanobacteria pigments in the main rivers of South Korea. Similarly, Irons et al. (2012) discussed the use of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission for obtaining remote sensing data. Additionally, Jargal et al. (2023) studied monsoon-induced responses of algal chlorophyll to trophic state, light availability, and morphometry in temperate reservoirs using environmental monitoring data. However, it should be noted that obtaining sufficient and high-quality data from a wide range of reservoirs can be limited by logistical and financial constraints, which can hinder the development of robust and generalized models (Hwang et al., 2003). In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include remote sensing data, water quality parameters, and environmental monitoring data obtained through surveys or sensors. Public datasets may also be available but can vary depending on the specific application and location.
