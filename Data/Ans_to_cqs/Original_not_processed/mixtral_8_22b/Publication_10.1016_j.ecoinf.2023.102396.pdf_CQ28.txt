1. Introduction 

Variability of animal abundances across space and time is a central 
theme of ecology (Koenig and Liebhold, 2016; Krebs, 2001; Lundberg 
et al., 2000). Spatiotemporal variations among the populations of the 
same  species  may  result  from  the  differential  responses  of  animal

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used based solely on this information.
