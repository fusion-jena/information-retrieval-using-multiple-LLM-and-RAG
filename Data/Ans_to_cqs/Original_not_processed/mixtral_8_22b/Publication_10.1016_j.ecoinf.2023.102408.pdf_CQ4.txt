The  model  initially  included  all  variables,  acknowledging  the  sig-
nificance  of  identifying  and  selecting  pertinent  variables  for  model 
development. Variable importance measures were employed to evaluate 
their significance, which helped identify the most influential variables 
for  predicting  AGB.  However,  it  is  recognised  that  assessing  model 
performance is essential, particularly when dealing with less important 
variables. A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB obser-
vations for this evaluation. This technique randomly allocated 70% of 
the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the vali-
dation  dataset.  Three  error  statistics,  specifically  R2,  mean  absolute 
error  (MAE),  and  RMSE  (as  indicated  in  Eqs.  8,  9,  and  10),  were 
employed to compare the accuracies of the models. The generated ma-
chine learning models were then extrapolated for the entire region. This

The RF algorithm, which has several advantages, was used in this 
study.  It  has  been  noted  in  prior  research  that  RF  outperforms  other 
machine-learning methods, particularly when handling extensive data-
sets (Lourenço et al., 2021). RF provides accurate information regarding 
critical  factors  and  is  less  sensitive  to  parameter  adjustments  (Cutler 
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2016). This method uses bagging or boosting 
algorithms to randomly select predictors. Despite these advantages, RF 
has certain limitations. Using a large number of predictors can increase 
model  complexity.  It  also  requires  careful  tuning  and  hyper- 
parameterisation  such  as  “mtry”  and  “ntree”,  there  is  a  risk  of  over-
fitting  if  these  parameters  are  not  adjusted  properly.  This  study  sys-
tematically  evaluated  mtry  from  1  to  10,  aiming  to  strike  a  balance 
between  stability  and  minimise  the  Root  Mean  Square Error  (RMSE).

ha). However, improving the prediction of a model in higher AGB ranges 
requires  additional  ground  data  points.  More  comprehensive  data  in 
these higher ranges will augment the accuracy of the AGB estimation 
models (Prakash et al., 2022).

overfitting issue, we used the parameter (c) to optimise the line fit and 
penalise the number of samples inside the margin. The value of c plays a

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines to artificially expand the size of the training set by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. These techniques help improve the performance and generalization capabilities of machine learning models. However, since no mention of such techniques is made in the provided context, I cannot provide a detailed response on this topic based on the available information.
