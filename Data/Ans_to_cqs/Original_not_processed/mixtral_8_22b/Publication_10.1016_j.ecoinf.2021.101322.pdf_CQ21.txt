CNN performance metrics. MSE is the mean square error, MAPE is the mean 
average percentage error, and Acc% is the average accuracy. In addition, the 
number of images in the dataset (set size) for each task and the weighting of 
classes are given. The × indicates that the performance metric is not applicable 
to the specific CNN.

Query: "What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include calculating evaluation metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and accuracy (%). These metrics have been used in this case to evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for various tasks like predicting river age, sea age, and spawning. Additionally, creating visualizations like saliency maps can help understand which parts of the input image were most important for the model's predictions. Lastly, constructing confusion matrices can also be useful for understanding the types of errors made by the model during prediction.
