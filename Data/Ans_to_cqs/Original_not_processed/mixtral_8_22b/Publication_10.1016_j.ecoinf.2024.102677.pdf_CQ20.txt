4.2. Landscape type classification 

The  five  network  models  were  evaluated  using  the  performance 
metrics  of  the  validation  and  test  sets.  The  model  accuracy  was 
continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the 
performance of the testing set guided the final decision. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the  learning  curves,  indicating  a  reduction  in  training  losses  as  the 
number  of  epochs  increases  and  convergence  within  500  epochs. 
Inceptionv3  converges  by  400  epochs,  while  the  other  networks 
converge  within  150  epochs.  The  ResNet  architecture,  especially 
ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforms the others.

To ensure the stability of the proposed models, we randomly divided 
the  dataset  into  three  parts:  training  (60%),  validation  (20%),  and 
testing  (20%)  (Meng  et  al.,  2022).  This  division  was  performed  in  a 
stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. 
The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (2880 images), a 
validation set (961 images), and a testing set (958 images). The models 
were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 Ã— 256 image input 
size. After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of 
epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.

In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in the field of 
image  recognition,  thus  greatly  improving  computer  processing. Con-
volutional neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning architecture 
applied to image classification with good performance in the extraction 
of underlying abstract features (Meng et al., 2022). Convolution layers, 
pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations consti-
tute the CNN model (Attri et al., 2023). We fine-tuned several state-of- 
the-art  CNN  architectures,  including  the  Visual  Geometry  Group 
(VGG)  (Simonyan  and  Zisserman,  2014),  Inception  (Szegedy  et  al., 
2016), and residual network (ResNet) (He et al., 2016) CNNs, using the 
training dataset, and we evaluated their respective  performances. We 
selected from these networks the most effective model to create the rural
