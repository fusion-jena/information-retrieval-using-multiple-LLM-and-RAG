facing all modern AI-based algorithms is their efficiency in terms of time

3.2. Fuel model retrieval 

Once the DL model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds 
are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a 
ground truth. This ground truth was required to validate the classifica-
tions using a DL model trained with synthetic data. As mentioned in the 
previous section, the best classification performance of the SoftGroup 
semantic branch was achieved by the MS input data case; therefore, this 
pretrained  model was  used,  and  its  efficiency was  tested  by  inferring 
these real MS point clouds (Fig. 9). In addition, these inferences on real 
MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme pre-
sented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final 
fuel model classifications are summarised in Table 3. 

4. Discussion

kernels were selected, and tensors with shapes [X, Y, Z, R1, and R2] were 
constructed to feed the SoftGroup model, as listed in Table 2. In addi-
tion, a system with four graphical processing units (NVIDIA A100 of 40 
GB HBM2 memory) was used within the Finisterrae III Supercomputer 
node system of the Centro de SupercomputaciÂ´on de Galicia to address 
this limitation.

Regardless of the model type employed for semantic classification, 
training  a  DNN  model  from  scratch  requires  a  substantial  number  of 
training samples to grasp a diverse range of features. The lack of liter-
ature on semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds being pre-
trained  with  synthetic  data  emphasises  the  importance  of  integrating 
augmented  data  simulations  during  the  training  phase  of  DL  models. 
Data augmentation addresses the requirement for large training datasets 
in DNNs, which can be achieved using an external simulator. Current 
research  on  LiDAR  point-cloud  simulations  predominantly  embraces 
two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically ALS, Terrestrial, and 
Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS, respectively) point clouds.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific frameworks or libraries used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the use of a pretrained SoftGroup model for semantic classification and mentions the need for a substantial number of training samples to capture diverse features. However, it does not mention any details regarding the implementation of the deep learning model, such as the use of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other frameworks.
