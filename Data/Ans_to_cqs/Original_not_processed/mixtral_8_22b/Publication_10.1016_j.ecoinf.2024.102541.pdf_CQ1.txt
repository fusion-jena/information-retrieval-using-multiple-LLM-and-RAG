and diversity.

tionally, our technique is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and from the baseline model we 
recorded  a  17.65%  increase  in  FPS,  28.55%  model  parameters  reduction,  and  50.92%  in  FLOPs  reduction. 
Furthermore, our model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas. This 
enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware, aiding conservation efforts through rapid analysis. The 
model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources of data collection have been employed across different studies. For instance, Antoine-Santoni et al. (2018) discuss the use of wireless tracking and sensor systems to monitor animal behavior, suggesting the utilization of sensor technology for gathering raw data. Additionally, Anders et al. (2021) focus on compensating class imbalance for acoustic chimpanzee detection, implying the use of audio recordings or sound sensors for data acquisition. Furthermore, Atila et al. (2021) work on plant leaf disease classification using images, indicating the usage of image databases or cameras for capturing visual information. Lastly, Bakana et al. (2020) address mitigating wildlife poaching, possibly involving surveillance footage or drone imagery for monitoring purposes. Overall, while the exact methods may vary depending on the application, some commonly used techniques include sensors, surveys, and publicly available datasets.
