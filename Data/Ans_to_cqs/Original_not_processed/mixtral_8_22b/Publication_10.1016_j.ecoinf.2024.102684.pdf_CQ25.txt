While  adopting  deep  learning  techniques  in  remote  sensing  has 
surged, providing novel solutions to complex problems and the devel-
opment of model validation frameworks has lagged, creating a gap in the 
reliability  of  these  advanced  models  (Filippelli  et  al.,  2024).  Deep 
learning models, including CNN architectures and traditional machine 
learning models, frequently underperform in predicting species presence 
or  coverage  in  previously  unconsidered  areas.  This  limitation,  often 
referred  to  as  the  model's  inability  to  generalize  or  transfer  learned 
patterns to new contexts (transfer learning), becomes particularly pro-
nounced in diverse landscapes characterized by significant variations in 
terrain  and  spectral properties  (Barela  et  al., 2021; Kattenborn et  al., 
2022;  Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  The  complex  nature  of  these  het-
erogeneous  environments  poses  significant  challenges  for  model  vali-

of the models. For instance, Mil`a et al. (2022) used the Nearest Neighbor 
Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV method to delineate a geographic 
space  in  which  predictions  can  be  made.  Many  of  these  approaches 
accurately  demonstrate  the  model's  transfer  learning  capabilities,  yet 
they  impose  limitations  on  the  training  domain,  leading  to  reduced 
training  heterogeneity  (Meyer  and  Pebesma,  2021).  However,  con-
ducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often 
infeasible due to  their high computational costs. Deep  learning-based 
models  typically  employ  simple  data  partitioning  strategies,  such  as 
training, validation, and testing (Ocer et al., 2020). This simple scheme 
can help to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, 
but may also overlook the diversity of heterogeneous spatial information 
in remotely sensed data that is aligned with different learning domains

CNNs  have  demonstrated  a  solid  ability  to  solve  computer  vision 
problems, outperforming even human performance in image classifica-
tion  (He et  al., 2016). CNNs can be used to solve different problems, 
including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and 
instance-based  segmentation.  The  differences  between  them  mainly 
depend on the architectures, the output function, and the labeling pro-
cess. For example, the regression approach based on CNN architectures 
receives an image, and then it passes through a series of convolutional 
layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid 
output function (Lathuiliere et al., 2020). This approach is often prac-
tical and easy to interpret, as it allows direct estimation of continuous 
transitions and  patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers.  Alter-
natively, semantic segmentation, e.g. using the UNet model, has been

Pre-trained  networks  offer  architectures  with  various  convolution 
operations that allow them to extract patterns within the images effi-
ciently.  After  the  convolutional  layers  of  pre-trained  networks,  it  is 
necessary to add a fully connected network architecture, also known as 
multi-layer perceptron. These layers are usually located at the end, and 
are responsible for reproducing the predictions of the final output. We 
compared different fully connected network architectures, exploring up 
to  three  hidden  layers  with  8,  16,  32,  and  64  neurons  in  each  layer. 
Consequently,  we  generated  12  models  for  each  dataset  trained  with 
different fully connected architectures. The output layer consisted of a 
single  neuron  with  a  sigmoid  activation  function,  producing  invasion 
predictions between 0.0 and 1.0.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), varies depending on its application. In this context, CNNs are used to solve different problems, including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and instance-based segmentation. The specific purpose of the model is determined by its architecture, output function, and labeling process.

For instance, the regression approach based on CNN architectures receives an image and passes it through a series of convolutional layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid output function. This approach is practical and easy to interpret, allowing direct estimation of continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers.

On the other hand, semantic segmentation, such as using the UNet model, is another application of CNNs. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, thus understanding what objects are present in the scene and where they are located.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context could be either regression or semantic segmentation, depending on the specific implementation and desired outcome.
