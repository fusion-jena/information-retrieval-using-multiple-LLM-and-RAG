Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Given unlabelled input data consisting of N samples with F features, 
x ∈ ℝN×F,  the  probabilistic  encoder  of  a  VAE  maps  the  input  to  the 
posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. In practice, 
L << N and the encoder neural network approximates the true posterior 
density, p(z|x), with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ 𝒩 (μθ, σ2
θ ). The 
decoder of a VAE reconstructs the input data from the latent variable 
and is given by the density function pφ(x|z). The encoder and decoder 
neural networks are parameterised by θ  and φ, respectively. The opti-
mization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms and it can 
be shown to be (Kingma and Welling, 2014)

dataset  recorded  at  a  different  location  and  was  gradually  expanded 
until  reconstructions  were  sufficiently  good.  In  order  to  visualize  the 
latent  representation,  the  size  of  the  bottleneck  of  the  model  (latent 
dimension) was limited to two. Details of the network architecture are 
reported in Table 1.

2.2. VAEs and β-annealing 

Variational  autoencoders  (VAEs)  consist  of  a  regularized  probabi-
listic  encoder-decoder  pair  and  are  some  of  the  most  powerful  repre-
sentation learning methods (Bengio et al., 2013; Kingma and Welling, 
2014). They have seen broad applications in generative modelling and 
unsupervised learning tasks.

The  quality  of  the  auto-encoded  reconstructions  is  controlled  by  the 
reconstruction loss ℒrec, which is the first term in Eq. (1). The encoder 
density is regularized to match the prior over the latent variable, p(z) ∼
𝒩 (0bf,I), enforced by the regularization loss, ℒreg, which is the Kullback- 
Leibler divergence (KLD) term in Eq. (1). At a high level, the regulari-
zation term controls the smoothness or the regularity of the latent space. 
Well structured and smooth latent spaces can yield useful representa-
tions of the input data.

Helpful Answer:

Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, I can provide some general insights into this topic.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to various factors like weight initialization, shuffling training examples, dropout layers, etc. To manage these sources of randomness, several strategies can be adopted:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: One common approach is setting fixed random seeds for all operations involving randomness. This ensures consistency across multiple runs of the same experiment, making results more comparable and reproducible.

2. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Some algorithms used within deep learning models, like certain types of normalization or optimization techniques, may introduce non-determinism. Opting for deterministic alternatives can help reduce variability caused by randomness.

3. **Repeat Experiments**: Running experiments multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can give a better understanding of the overall performance and robustness of the model.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting hyperparameters related to random processes, such as learning rate schedules or dropout rates, might also impact how much randomness affects the final outcome.
