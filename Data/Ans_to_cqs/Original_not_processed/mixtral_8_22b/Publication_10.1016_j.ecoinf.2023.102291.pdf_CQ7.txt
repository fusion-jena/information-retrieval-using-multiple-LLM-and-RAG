size of 32. The most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best 
validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision 
(number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives) 
obtained during training. The model training and prediction procedures 
were  executed  on  Microsoft  Azure  using  instance  NV12s  v3  with  12 
vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The CNNs were implemented using Tensor-
Flow (Abadi et al., 2016) and Python 3. The Ubuntu 20.04 operating 
system was used and obtained via the Ubuntu 20.04 Data Science Virtual 
Machine  on  Microsoft  Azure.  The  algorithm  scripts  are  available  in

for the customised architecture (see Convolutional neural networks sec-
tion),  and  the  smallest  one  comprised  3900  images  combining  two 
seconds  window  size  and  90  dpi  for  the  transfer  learning  approach 
(Table 1).

To test the efficacy of our models, we created several segments by 
using  the  same  sliding  window  approach.  Namely,  we used  the  same 
window size that was used in training, and thus multiple segments were 
created  across  the  entire  testing  file  by  moving  the  window  by  one 
second  in  the  moored  recording.  We  converted  each  of  these  testing 
segments into spectrograms (FFT length = 1024; hop size = 128; Hann 
window) which were used as input for subsequent model prediction. All 
generated spectrogram images were created as 5 × 5 in. but varied in 
their dpi configuration, ranging from 200 × 200 (40 dpi) to 500 × 500 
(100 dpi) samples. The number of images used per class was constrained 
by our computational resources, and we used the maximum number of 
images possible in each case. We attempted a number of experiments 
and varied the number of classes. The largest dataset built comprised 
80,000 images when combining three seconds window size and 40 dpi

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about how the data is split for deep learning model training. However, it can be inferred that the authors use a validation set to evaluate their models during training, as they mention choosing the most suitable architecture based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. This suggests that they likely follow common practices in machine learning where the dataset is typically split into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model. It is also mentioned that the models are tested on a separate testing file, suggesting that there might be a distinct testing set apart from the training and validation sets.
