Feichtenhofer et al. (2019). This parameter combination achieved the 
best  results  in  our  experiments.  The  Slow  and  Fast  pathways  are 
implemented by a ResNet-101. 

We  split  the  annotated  dataset  AnnotationsActions  (cf.  Section  2.2) 
randomly (but fixed for all experiments and all networks) into a train set, 
validation set and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of 
each class. Of the remaining clips, again 20% of the clips in each class 
form the validation set. The remaining clips are the training set.

The three ResNet variants are trained for 40 epochs starting with an 
initial learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate is decreased every 10 
epochs by multiplying it with a γ = 0.1. For optimization we utilize the 
Stochastic  Gradient  Descent  (SGD)  with  a  momentum  of  0.9  and  a

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used as optimization technique. 
We start with a learning rate of 0.0005, a momentum of 0.9 and weight 
decay of 0.0005. Different settings of momentum and weight decay are 
checked but show no improvements. In the training process, we decrease 
the learning rate every 10 epochs by multiplying it with γ = 0.1. In the 
first  epoch  we  use  warmup  iterations  for  the  learning  rate  with  a 
warmup factor of 1/1000. These parameters gave the best results in our 
evaluations. We train our models for 30 epochs.

The SlowFast architecture is trained in 40 epochs with an initial base 
learning rate of 0.1. We use 5 warmup epochs with a warmup learning 
rate of 0.001. Momentum is set to 0.9 and the weight decay parameter is 
(cid:0) 4.  The  learning  rate  is  decreased  with  a  cosine  strategy.  The 
1  ⋅  10
optimization technique is SGD and the loss function is the cross entropy 
loss. In this parameter selection we follow Feichtenhofer et al. (2019). 
We set the temporal length of the input to 16 frames. We set the sam-
pling rate to 4 and α = 2. The parameter β is set to 1/8 as proposed by

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have utilized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as their optimization technique. They started with a learning rate of 0.0005, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. During the training process, they decreased the learning rate every 10 epochs by multiplying it with γ = 0.1. Additionally, they employed warmup iterations for the learning rate in the first epoch with a warmup factor of 1/1000. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategy or metric being used to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
