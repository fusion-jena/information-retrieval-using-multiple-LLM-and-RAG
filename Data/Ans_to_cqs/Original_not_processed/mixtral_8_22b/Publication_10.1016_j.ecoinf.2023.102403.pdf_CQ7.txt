scales associated with data collection (Zizka et al., 2020). Due to these 
disparities,  scholars  recommend  a  thorough  examination  and  refine-
ment  of  these  data  repositories  (Bonnet-Lebrunm  et  al.,  2023).  To 
enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive 
series  of  filters  has  been  systematically  applied  to  our  analysis.  To 
minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS re-
positories,  we  curated  the  dataset  following  Zizka  et  al.  (2020)  and 
filtered the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, 
“year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. We retained all taxonomic informa-
tion down to the species level and removed records with NA in these 
columns. We also removed all duplicate records with identical latitude

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., train, test, validation sets). However, it can be inferred that the authors followed standard practices for splitting their cleaned and filtered dataset into different subsets for training, testing, and validating their models. Typically, this involves randomly dividing the dataset into three parts: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters during model development), and test set (used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model). Without additional context or access to the full paper, it is not possible to provide more detailed information about the exact proportions or methods used for splitting the data.
