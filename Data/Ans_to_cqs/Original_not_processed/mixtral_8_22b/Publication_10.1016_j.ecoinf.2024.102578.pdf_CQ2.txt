3.2. Image quality classification: Training dataset and model training 

Using the manual classifications, we randomly selected images from 
each site, camera, and year, to obtain ~15,000 images of Bad quality 
and  ~  57,000  images  of  Good  quality  for  each  location  (Finnmark 
2016–2018 and 2020–2021 and Yamal 2017–2021). These images were 
then  reexamined  by  GC  and  DE,  and  any  misclassified  images  were 
removed or reclassified. We also excluded marginal images (e.g., partly 
blurred images, images where an animal is only visible with a tail in a

sites for 6 years in Finnmark and 9 or 10 cameras for 6 years in Yamal.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images since the study focuses on image classification using ResNet-50, which is a convolutional neural network commonly used for image recognition tasks. Additionally, the mention of MegaDetector suggests that the input data consists of images, as this tool is specifically designed for object detection in images. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
