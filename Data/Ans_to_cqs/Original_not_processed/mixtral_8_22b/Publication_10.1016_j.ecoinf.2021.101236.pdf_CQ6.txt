followed  the  original  Wide  ResNet  design.  Our  downsampling  blocks 
employed the changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). The third and final 
component, the classification block, was derived from (Schlüter, 2018) 
and resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second (i. 
e., three predictions per 3-s input spectrogram) followed by global log- 
mean-exponential  pooling  and  sigmoid  activation.  Most  convolutions 
use 3 × 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normali-
zation  (Ioffe  and  Szegedy,  2015)  and  ReLU  activation  (if  not  noted 
differently).  Because  we  treated  spectrograms  as  monochrome  input 
images, the input was a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384,

schedule  whenever  the  validation  loss  stalled.  This  also  included  a 
step-wise reduction of dropout probabilities by 0.1, starting at an initial 
probability of 0.5. Early stopping with a cooldown of 3 epochs prevented 
overfitting. We started with a maximum amount of 500 sample spec-
trograms  per  class  and  increased  that  amount  by  1000  whenever 
training was finished—pre-trained snapshots were used to initialize the 
weights. Finally, an approach of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 
2015) was used to train a born-again network (Furlanello et al., 2018) 
using  the  best  previous  snapshot  as  a  teacher.  Doing  so  helped  to 
improve the overall performance even though the capacity of the model 
remained unchanged. We did not experiment with ensemble techniques 
due to the high computational demand and the respective lack of real- 
world  applicability  despite  their  popularity  for  this  kind  of  task.  Our

Our model is based on a residual network or ResNet. ResNets are easy 
to implement and can be scaled in both width and depth to fit the needs 
of the training scenario best. (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016) showed 
that wide residual networks provided similar performance compared to 
extremely  deep  architectures  despite  limited  depth.  This  can  be 
explained by improved regularization in the residual blocks and scaling 
of network in width (scaling factor K) and depth (scaling factor N) to 
identify  the  best  possible  layout.  We  followed  this  design  and  chose 
scaling factors of K = 4 and N = 3 to build our network, which resulted in 
a  sequence  of  157  total  layers  of  which  36  are  weighted.  Three  core 
components formed the succession of layers in our model. First, a pre- 
processing block transformed the original input spectrogram before it 
was passed through a series of residual stacks. Second, this sequence of

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the data before feeding it into the deep learning model. However, it mentions that there is a pre-processing block in the model architecture that transforms the original input spectrogram before passing it through a series of residual stacks. It can be assumed that some form of preprocessing might have been performed within this pre-processing block, but without further details, it cannot be determined what exactly these preprocessing steps entail.
