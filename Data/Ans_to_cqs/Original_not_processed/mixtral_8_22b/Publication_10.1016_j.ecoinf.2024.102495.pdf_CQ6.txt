The standard deviation values for each performance indicator were 
compared  to  determine  the  optimal  configuration  (Table  4).  Configu-
ration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter (number of bands: 60, 
number of frames: 40, hop length: 256, and length of the FFT window: 
1024)  owing  to  its  reduced  standard  deviation  value.  The  feature 
extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed 
during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the 
CNN  deep  learning  model.  The  model  optimization  outcomes  were 
derived  using  performance  criteria  identical  to  those  employed  to 
optimize  feature  extraction  parameters.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  perfor-
mance evaluation of each model. Additionally, Model 1 exhibited the 
most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy 
rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The obtained

2.2.3. Deep learning 

Once transformed into a matrix or vector, the results of voice feature 
extraction serve as the input for a deep learning algorithm. This algo-
rithm discerns patterns within the data, enabling it to make predictions 
based on these learned patterns, all without the need for explicit pro-
gramming (França et al., 2021; Navamani, 2019). A critical distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning is the feature- 
extraction  process  during  classification.  Feature  extraction  from  data 
typically requires manual or human intervention in traditional machine 
learning.  Contrastingly,  deep  learning  models  are  designed  to  auto-
matically perform feature extraction.

In a CNN, a convolution layer performs convolution operations be-
tween the pixels on the input and several kernels or filters. The math-
ematical equation of the convolution process is as follows, where f is the 
input data and h is the kernel size.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps can be applied depending on the nature of the dataset. These may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the features so they fall within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling adjusts the scale of independent variables to bring them to an appropriate level. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points by removing or imputing them. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., which helps improve the model's generalizability. However, not all datasets require every step, and some might benefit more from certain techniques than others. It ultimately depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed.
