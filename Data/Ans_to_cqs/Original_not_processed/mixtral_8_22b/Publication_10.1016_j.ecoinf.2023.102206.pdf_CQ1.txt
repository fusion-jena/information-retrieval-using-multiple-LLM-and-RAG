The industrialization has been the primary cause of the economic boom in almost all countries. However, this 
happened  at  the  cost  of  the  environment,  as  industrialization  also  caused  carbon emissions  to  increase  expo-
nentially. According to the established literature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is related to carbon emissions 
(CO2) which could be optimally employed to precisely estimate a country’s GDP. However, the scarcity of data is 
a  significant  bottleneck  that  could  be  handled  using  transfer  learning  (TL)  which  uses  previously  learned  in-
formation to resolve new tasks, more specifically, related tasks. Notably, TL is highly vulnerable to performance 
degradation due to the deficiency of suitable information and hesitancy in decision-making. Therefore, this paper 
proposes ‘Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL)’, which is trained to use CO2 emission data of developed

• This provides valuable information for understanding the 
environmental impact of energy consumption and helps in 
formulating effective policies to reduce CO2 emissions. 
• Proposed work assesses the air quality where concentration 

and toxicity levels are modelled using IT2 FSs.  

• Helps to identify contributing components for the resulting air 
quality, which further may enhance decision-making pro-
cesses related to environmental policies and health-related 
issues. 

• This work utilizes acoustic data and deep CNN to identify 

oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows.  

• Also, provide ways for monitoring and early warning systems 

on pig farms.  

• Better reproduction capability in sows may upscale the 
economic efficiency and production level of pigs.  

• A sustainable perspective for the pig farming operations. 
• The ecological implications of the proposed work are directly 
associated with the increasing CO2 emissions resulting from 
industrialization.

This  tightly  coupled  relationship  between  CO2  emission  and  GDP 
motivated us to predict the GDP of a nation using its carbon emission. 
However,  the  available  dataset  of  some  countries  is  not  sufficient 
enough to train a machine learning (ML) model. To overcome this lim-
itation,  this  paper  proposes  a  novel  transfer  learning  methodology. 
Transfer  learning  (TL),  a  machine  learning  (ML)  technique,  utilizes 
previously learned information to resolve new tasks, more specifically, 
related tasks. In conventional ML techniques, every new task is learned 
from the scratch (Che et al., 2021), and the training and test data are 
drawn from the same distribution. However, if the data distribution is 
changed between the training and test data, the performance and reli-
ability  of  the  predicted  output  may  degrade  significantly  (Lu  et  al., 
2019). This may also lead to high computational costs and inappropriate

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that various methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to gather specific data relevant to the problem being addressed. For instance, in the context of estimating driver drowsiness, EEG signals were collected through surveys or experiments involving human subjects.

2. Sensors: Sensors play a crucial role in gathering real-time data for various applications. In the case of identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows, acoustic data was collected using appropriate sensors. Similarly, sensors can be deployed to collect data on CO2 emissions, land use classification, and other environmental factors.

3. Public Datasets: Existing datasets can be leveraged to supplement or replace the need for primary data collection. Examples mentioned in the context include housing datasets, email spam filtering text datasets, Brodatz texture datasets, Intel Berkeley dataset, De Montfort University Robotics dataset, and others. These datasets can be used for tasks such as domain adaptation, multitask learning, and unsupervised transfer learning.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline depend on the nature of the problem being addressed and the availability of existing datasets. Common approaches include conducting surveys, deploying sensors, and utilizing public datasets.
