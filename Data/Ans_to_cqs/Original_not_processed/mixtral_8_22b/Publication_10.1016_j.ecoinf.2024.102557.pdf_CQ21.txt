The patterns found by random forest models are informative about 
the  relationships  between  species-specific  productivity  and  environ-
mental  conditions.  These  models  have  been  extensively  contrasted  to 
explain relationships between variables and estimate their importance 
(Gregorutti  et  al.,  2017),  and  used  in  different  fields  of  ecology,  for 
instance biomass quantification (Kaveh et al., 2023), species distribution 
modeling (Valavi et al., 2021) and genomic studies (Brieuc et al., 2018). 
Although machine learning models cannot explicitly detect proximate 
variables  that  reveal  the  causal  relationships  between  fungal  produc-
tivity and the sampled environment, they can be very helpful in disen-
tangling these complex relationships (Archer and Kimes, 2008). This is 
especially  helpful  in  Mediterranean  environments,  where  mushroom 
productivity is closely related to short-term weather conditions (Alday

analytical  methods and  modeling tools  are needed to  deal with  these 
challenges (Tan et al., 2006). Over the past years, the field of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning has enabled significant advances in

2.2. Modeling 

We  trained productivity  models for  B.  edulis, H.  repandum,  L. deli-
ciosus, M. procera and T. portentosum based on the random forest algo-
rithm and the R package “ranger” (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). Random 
forest models allow us to find consistent nonlinear ecological relation-
ships  among  a  large  number  of  predictors,  making  them  suitable  for 
predicting  this  resource  that  sometimes  appears  to  be  driven  by

Model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model 
using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared 
error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation 
(Roberts et al., 2017) with ten folds, as implemented in the R package 
“mlr3mbo” (Kotlarski et al., 2014). The search space of optimal hyper-
parameters was defined by the ranges of “mtry”  (number of variables 
randomly sampled as candidates at each split), “min.node.size”  (mini-
mum size of terminal nodes), and “num.trees” (number of trees to grow) 
shown  in  Table  S3  (the  abbreviations  of  the  hyperparameters  used 
correspond to the terminology used in the R package “ranger”).

Helpful Answer:
After the model training process using the random forest algorithm and the R package "ranger," several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. However, it should be noted that the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or metrics calculations may not directly apply to random forest models since they are more commonly associated with deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, there are still important postprocessing steps relevant to random forest models.

One crucial step involves evaluating the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics. In this case, the authors mention using root mean square error (RMSE) as part of the Bayesian optimization process during hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, calculating the final RMSE value for each species-specific model would provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, other common evaluation metrics for regression tasks, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or coefficient of determination (R^2), could also be calculated to further assess the model's performance.

Moreover, variable importance measures can be derived from random forest models to understand which input features contribute most significantly to the predicted output. For instance, the authors might calculate feature importances using the 'importance' function in the ranger package, which provides permutation-based variable importance scores. By examining these scores, researchers can gain insights into the key environmental factors influencing mushroom productivity for each species.

Lastly, while saliency maps and confusion matrices do not directly apply to random forest models, visualizing the relationship between the predicted values and actual observations through scatter plots or residual plots can help identify any systematic errors or trends in the data. Furthermore, partial dependence plots can be generated to illustrate the marginal effect of individual features on the predicted response, providing additional insights into the functional form of the learned relationships.
