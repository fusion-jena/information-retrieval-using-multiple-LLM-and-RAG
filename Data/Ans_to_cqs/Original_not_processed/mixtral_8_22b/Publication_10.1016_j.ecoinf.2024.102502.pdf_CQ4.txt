2.1. Data filtering

2.3. Data scaling 

The final step refers to data scaling, and intrinsically to gap filling 
and data matching levels required by the user. Different scaling domains 
have been suggested by Fritsch et al. (2020). As the interest relies on 
aggregating  data  across  scales  prior  to  modelling,  our  approach  con-
forms  to  a  “pre-modelling  scaling”  protocol  (Fritsch  et  al.,  2020). 
Sequential  processes  were  implemented  within  GEE  for  scaling  up 
environmental  time  series  from  one  spatial  and/or  temporal  scale  to 
another during data extraction.

under study. Also, data scaling may be particularly useful for gap-filling 
operations,  offering  opportunities  to  avoid  missing  information  within 
extracted  data.  Briefly,  by  increasing  the  spatio-temporal  scale  around 
ground  observations,  users  may  ensure  higher  chances  of  avoiding 
missing  data,  through  the  aggregation  of  spatio-temporal  information 
within moving windows (Fig. 1). However, this implies also a decrease in 
data-matching  accuracy  (Fig.  1).  Key  decisions  and  trade-offs  must  be 
therefore made when extracting spatio-temporal multiscale data, possibly 
involving  particular  strategic  decisions  to  overcome  eventual  imple-
mentation constraints (see the Supplementary information S1.2 section). 

2.4. Worfklow replicability

Flexible data scaling is challenging not only because data may sub-
stantially differ across sensors in terms of spatial and temporal charac-
teristics, but also because EOS data acquisition often includes hundreds 
or even thousands of scenes to process. Despite the promising possibility 
to  collect  multi-sensor  multi-temporal  time  series  spanning  decades, 
sequential process steps of such EOS big data are only possible through 
advanced frameworks and enhanced computational power (Ma et al., 
2015). In this direction, online data repositories and cloud computing 
platforms  (e.g.  Google  Earth  Engine;  GEE;  Gorelick  et  al.,  2017)  are 
progressively  providing  a  compelling  solution,  given  their  ever- 
increasing  capacity  to  store  data  from  multiple  satellites,  combined 
with big data fast computation (Gorelick et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2015). In 
particular,  the  GEE  platform  has  witnessed  a  significant  increase  in

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the concept of data scaling, which can be considered a form of data augmentation. Data scaling involves adjusting the size or resolution of datasets to match different spatial and temporal scales. This technique is used to aggregate data across scales before modeling, following a pre-modeling scaling protocol. It is particularly useful for gap-filling operations, allowing users to avoid missing information within extracted data by increasing the spatio-temporal scale around ground observations. This process is facilitated by platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE), which offer advanced frameworks and enhanced computational power for handling large-scale EOS data.
