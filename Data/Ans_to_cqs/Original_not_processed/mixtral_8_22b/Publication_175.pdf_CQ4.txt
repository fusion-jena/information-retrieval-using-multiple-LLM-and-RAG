a new task with a very limited dataset, usually only 1–5 thumbnails per 
class.

There are two ways to tackle this problem of lack of data. The first 
one  consists  of  directly  addressing  the  data  itself,  through  data 
augmentation (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong 
et al., 2016). The second option is to change the classification algorithm. 
Few-shots learning (FSL) algorithms (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005) are 
designed to compute a classification task (query, noted Q) with only a 
few  thumbnails  to  train  (Support  Sets,  noted  SS),  and  it  has  been 
increasingly studied since 2017 (Finn et al., 2017). Few-shots learning 
methods are divided into three main approaches. Metric-based methods 
are embedding both queries (Q) and support sets (Ss), before assigning to 
the query a class, according to distances computed between Q and Ss 
(Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). The 
second approach consists of 1) training a model on a large database, and

Helpful Answer:
The papers by Van Dyk and Meng (2012), Wang and Perez (2017), and Wong et al. (2016) discuss various data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These techniques help address the issue of limited datasets, especially in tasks where there may be only 1-5 samples per class.

Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones. This can significantly increase the size of the dataset without actually collecting more data. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color shifting.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically reversing an image. Rotating involves turning the image around its center point by a certain degree. Scaling changes the size of the image, either enlarging or shrinking it. Cropping removes parts of the image, while color shifting modifies the colors within the image.

These techniques can be combined and applied randomly during training to create even more diverse samples. For example, an image could be flipped, then scaled down, and finally have its colors shifted. Each combination results in a unique sample, further expanding the dataset.

However, not all transformations are suitable for every type of data. For instance, flipping might distort the meaning of some images, such as those containing text or specific spatial relationships. Therefore, careful consideration must be given when choosing which transformations to apply.

Overall, these data augmentation techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of deep learning models, particularly when dealing with small datasets. They provide a practical solution to the challenge of insufficient data, enabling models to learn more robust features and improve their accuracy.
