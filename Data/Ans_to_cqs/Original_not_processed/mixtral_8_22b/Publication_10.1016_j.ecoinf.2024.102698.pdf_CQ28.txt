convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  auto  encoders  and  generative 
adversarial  networks  (GAN),  and  are  better  at  learning  sophisticated 
patterns in data but can be more computationally expensive and require 
more data to train (Endres et al., 2022).

model  flexibility  and  compatibility  to  generate  data  packages  for  the 
purposes listed above. The methods used to demonstrate the utility of 
the data models (often called general utility) (Snoke et al., 2018), were 
chosen for their applicability to a range of data types (allowing com-
parison across different input datasets) and high compatibility with the 
Synthetic  Data  Vault  python  package.  These  are  discussed  in  further 
detail in Section V.

5.4. Connectivity data 

The  synthetic  connectivity  data  was  generated  using  a  Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python 
package (YData, 2023), as this model was able to replicate the sparse-
ness  of  the  original  connectivity  matrices  best  and  performed  best  in 
terms of the utility metrics. GAN models feature a generator component, 
which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, 
and  a  discriminator,  which  is  a  classification  model  which  learns  to 
classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator 
updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of 
the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
None of the given sources provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform was used.
