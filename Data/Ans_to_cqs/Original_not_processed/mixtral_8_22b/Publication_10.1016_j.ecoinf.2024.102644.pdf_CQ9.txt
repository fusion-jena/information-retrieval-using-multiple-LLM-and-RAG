in the basin, based on 180 resident species’ data. As species observation 
data,  we  use  data  from  a  public  authoritative  repository  of  big  data 
(GBIF)  improved  with  reliable  records  we  accurately  and  directly 
observed in the field.

Several large-scale repositories of FAIR biodiversity data are publicly 
available (Candela et al., 2015). Among these, the Global Biodiversity 
Information Facility (GBIF) (Lane and Edwards, 2007) and the Ocean 
Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) (Grassle, 2000) are often used 
in ecological and ecosystem models. Data FAIRness is guaranteed by the 
adoption  of  domain-specific  standards  (e.g.,  Darwin  Core  (Wieczorek 
et  al.,  2012))  and  large-scale  e-Infrastructures  providing  high- 
availability access services (Assante et al., 2019; Assante et al., 2022; 
Candela  et  al.,  2015).  These  repositories  include  millions  of  records 
regarding species’ observations across multiple decades, allowing spe-
cies presence and commonness tracking over time. However, these data 
should be used cautiously because they could include sampling biases - 
due to varying sampling efforts and paths over time and space - driving

The GBIF repository is a taxonomic and observation data provider 
involved in several data FAIRness initiatives (Lane and Edwards, 2007). 
Unlike other data providers, GBIF has a broad scope across taxonomic 
orders and kingdoms. It currently hosts ~2.5 billion observation data 
records at the global scale. An R package is available to automatise the 
retrieval  of  occurrence  records  containing  taxonomic,  coordinate, 
sighting authorship, and primary source information.

The repository contains all data (including ESRI-GRID raster files), 
tables, images, animations, and data-manipulation scripts. It is organ-
ised as a step-by-step process in subsequent folders. It also includes the 
list  of  species  used  to  estimate  species  richness  (https://zenodo. 
org/record/8380273/files/All_species_modelled.txt)  and 
the complete set of observation records. 

All data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Crit-
ical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e- 
Infrastructure  (Assante  et  al.,  2019;  Assante  et  al.,  2022;  Coro  et  al., 
2015c; Coro et al., 2017) (https://services.d4science.org/). 
Free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment 
are required.

Helpful Answer: The data repository for this study can be found on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment, which is available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. This virtual research environment includes all data, such as ESRI-GRID raster files, tables, images, animations, and data manipulation scripts. Additionally, it provides the list of species used to estimate species richness and the complete set of observation records. Free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment is required.

However, it should be noted that while GBIF is mentioned as one of the sources of data used in this study, the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated as being hosted on GBIF. Therefore, it cannot be definitively confirmed that the data repository is available on GBIF without further clarification or additional context.
