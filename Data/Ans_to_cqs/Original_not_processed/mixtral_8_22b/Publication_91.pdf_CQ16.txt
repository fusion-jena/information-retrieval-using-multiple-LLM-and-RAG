Higher values of per-channel accuracy and F-measure indicate better
performance and vice versa.

Classiﬁer evaluation For the evaluation of the classiﬁer results,
different parameters were determined. The classiﬁcation rate or
accuracy for a species is given by the relation:
TP þ TN
TP þ TN þ FP þ FN

Accuracy ¼

where TP (true positive rate) indicates accurate positive identiﬁ-
cations (e.g. pollen species x is identiﬁed correctly as pollen
species x) are correctly predicted (pollen x), TN (true negative
rate) indicates accurate negative identiﬁcations (e.g. pollen species
y is identiﬁed correctly as not being pollen species x), FP (false
positive rate) indicates that the observation is different but pre-
dicted as true (e.g. pollen species y is identiﬁed to be pollen
species x), and FN (false negative rate) indicates that a true obser-
vation is predicted to be different (e.g. pollen species x is identi-
ﬁed to not be pollen species x). As accuracy counts all kinds of
errors with the same costs, it is important to consider other more
detailed parameters in addition:

%Query
Query: "What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing no further improvement in validation loss or accuracy over several epochs (also known as a validation loss plateau), or meeting a predefined threshold for a chosen metric such as accuracy or F-score. In this case, since the learning rate is exponentially decayed every 3 epochs, one potential criterion could be monitoring the model's performance after each decay period and stopping the training if there is no significant improvement.
