to calibrate Deep Learning models using a single parameter for all  classes35. This parameter is used, instead of 
the traditional softmax function, to convert the vector output from the neural network into a real probability.

training datasets.

•  In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a CNN on a given database T0 (Fig. 2a)
•  Then, the second phase consists of tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e. each species in our 

case), noted i, with i ∈ {1, ..., n} , using a second and independent database noted T1 (Fig. 2b).

In terms of classification, it means we transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) in 3 options 

(Fig. 3) by applying Eqs. (15, 16).

Computing the confidence thresholds.  After the phase 1 (model training phase), for an image X of the 
threshold tuning dataset processed by the classifier, we obtain an output {C(X), S(X)} , where C(X) is the class 
(i.e. species, belonging to the trained set of species) with the highest classification score S(X). For this image, we 
know the ground truth Y in {1, .., n} belonging to the same set of species classes.

Table 1.   Output of the deep learning classifier without post-processing. Percentages of correct classifications 
are shown for the 20 fish species. Each line shows the species name, the correct classification rate of images of 
this species present in the dataset T2, the softmax score above which we have 95% of the correct classification 
(noted sq0.05), and the percentage of Misclassified images with score equal or above sq0.05.

•  First, the image is given to the CNN, which outputs a list of scores, including S(X) the highest score obtained

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, there is mention of a two-phase process involving building a classification model by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a given database T0, followed by tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class using a second and independent database T1. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed during these phases, but the exact method remains unspecified based on the available information.
