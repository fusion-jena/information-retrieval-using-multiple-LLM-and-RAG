training while 40% of the images were used for testing. In 
order to develop and compare the models for both datasets, 
we split the original 40% testing data into validation (20%) 
and testing (20%). So, the final distribution of the dataset 
was  60%  for  training,  20%  for  validation,  and  20%  for 
testing.

Helpful Answer:
The text provides information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. According to the given context, the original dataset was divided into two parts: 60% for training and 40% for testing. To further evaluate and compare the performance of different models, the initial 40% testing data was then subdivided into validation (20%) and testing (20%) sets. This resulted in a final distribution of 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involved allocating 60% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and another 20% for testing purposes.
