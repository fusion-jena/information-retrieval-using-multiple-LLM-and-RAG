The  successful  prediction  is  also  attributed  to  the  robust  deep 
learning models. Lamichhane et al. (2019) reviewed soil carbon map-
ping methods and reported that deep learning is a promising technique 
for improving SOC prediction. The emphasis on deep learning has also 
been noted by Wadoux et al. (2019), who used this technique to predict 
soil  C.  They  found  that  the  deep  learning  technique  significantly 
increased  prediction  accuracy.  In  addition  to  SOC  prediction,  some 
recent studies have used deep learning in the field of ecological infor-
matics and  demonstrated the  ability of this technique  to improve the 
prediction  of  ecological  components  such  as  forest  vegetation  cover 
(Kalinaki  et  al.,  2023)  and  agriculture-related  elements  (Attri  et  al., 
2023).  According  to  them,  deep  learning  has  the  potential  to  be  a 
valuable technique for ecological analysis.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the management of random seed values. However, it can still provide insights into how deep learning techniques have been applied in various fields, particularly in soil carbon mapping and ecological information.

In general, handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline involves several strategies. One common approach is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or experiments. Another strategy is employing cross-validation techniques, which involve splitting data into multiple subsets and iteratively training and testing the model on these subsets. This helps reduce overfitting and provides a more accurate estimation of the model's performance. Additionally, using dropout layers within neural networks can help introduce randomness during training, preventing overfitting and improving overall model performance. Lastly, ensembling multiple models trained with different initializations or architectures can further mitigate the impact of randomness and potentially lead to better predictions.
