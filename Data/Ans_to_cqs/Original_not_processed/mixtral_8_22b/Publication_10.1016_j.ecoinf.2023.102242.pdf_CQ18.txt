Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information about a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the model might have been evaluated using accuracy and Kappa statistics. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances, while Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between two raters who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories. In this case, the first rater could be the actual values, and the second rater could be the predicted values. Therefore, these metrics could potentially be used to monitor the model performance during training. Nevertheless, without explicit mention or description of such a strategy in the provided context, this remains speculative.
