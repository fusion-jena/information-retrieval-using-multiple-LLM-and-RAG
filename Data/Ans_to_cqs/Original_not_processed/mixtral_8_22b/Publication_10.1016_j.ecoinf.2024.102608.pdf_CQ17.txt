in various scientific domains. Machine learning algorithms can extract 
patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich 
features,  and  establish  relationships.  They  offer  advantages  over 
empirical and semi-analytical algorithms by bypassing errors introduced 
during atmospheric correction and providing universal and optimized 
water  quality  models  based  on  reservoir  datasets  (Li  et  al.,  2021b; 
Pahlevan et al., 2019b). This combination is particularly suited to large- 
scale applications for quantifying and mapping water quality parame-
ters,  such  as  CHL-a,  TSS,  and  SD.  Moreover,  machine  learning  algo-
rithms can handle complex non-linear relationships in multidimensional 
space,  enabling  comprehensive  investigations  and  management  of 
reservoir environments. Several machine learning algorithms, including 
neural  network  (NN)  (Hong  et  al.,  2022;  Reichstein  et  al.,  2019),

possible combinations of hyperparameters, which can be computation-

to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search,

various  cases  by  combining  hyperparameter  values  extracted  from  a

the intervals used in the grid search. After the randomized grid search,

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses a randomized grid search method to select hyperparameters, which helps strike a balance between model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. Randomized grid search is a technique where a subset of the parameter grid is randomly selected to explore instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters. This approach reduces computational cost, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and has been shown to find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others. Although the text does not mention any specific regularization techniques, common methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training to reduce co-adaptation and improve generalization. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and encourage simpler models. Early stopping stops training once validation error starts increasing, while data augmentation increases the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing samples.
