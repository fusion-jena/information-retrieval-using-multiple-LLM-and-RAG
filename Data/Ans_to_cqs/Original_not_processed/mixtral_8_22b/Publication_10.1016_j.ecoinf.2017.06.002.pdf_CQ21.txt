with related processing approaches (e.g. raw, translated/processed,
data originator QA/QC, project-level QA/QC), 4) references to the
measurement setting description (e.g., E-ﬁeld Log ﬁle)—this informa-
tion is essential because it links the data to additional metadata re-
ported in the separate templates described in Section 3.3 (see
Fig. 2)—, and 5) references to data ﬁle descriptions (Data Column

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response based on the given context.
