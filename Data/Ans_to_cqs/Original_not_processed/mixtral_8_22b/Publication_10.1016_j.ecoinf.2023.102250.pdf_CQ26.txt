feature maps and weights obtained through the two convolutional layers 

′
in the residual block. The resulting feature map, denoted as X
, is then 
input into the upsampling layer to double its size and obtain Xout. These 
skip connections enable the neural network to effectively capture the 
relationship between input and output features, learn deeper represen-
tations, and enhance the quality of the generated images. 

The attention mechanism enables the network to selectively focus on 
essential parts of the feature map and enhance the weights in specific 
channels or spatial regions based on calculated attention scores. It ac-
quires  essential  information  while  enhancing  the  quality  and  level  of 
detail in the generated images. Fig. 4 illustrates the attention mecha-
nism’s model structure.

extended with time and time-frequency attention mechanisms. In: Conference and

number of convolutional weights by a factor of K, resulting in a lack of 
compactness  in  the  model.  Secondly,  jointly  optimizing  dynamic 
attention and static convolutional kernels becomes a challenging task. 
To address these issues, Li proposed the dynamic convolutional kernel 
decomposition in 2021 (Li et al., 2021). This approach effectively re-
duces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves 
the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic 
convolutional kernels. 

In (Li et al., 2021), the static convolution kernel can be re-defining by 

the formula 9. 

Wk = W0 + ΔWk, k ∈ {1, …, K}

thereby limiting the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient 
and making the function smoother. This property ensures more stable 
parameter  changes  and  reduces  the  likelihood  of  gradient  explosion 
during neural network optimization, leading to improved training sta-
bility of the model. 

Spectral normalization(Miyato et al., 2018) achieved Lipschitz con-
tinuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each 
layer  of  the  network  in  the  discriminator.  This  approach  is  simple, 
efficient,  and  does  not  require  additional  hyperparameter  tuning. 
Therefore,  it  is  widely  adopted  to  train  stable  GANs(Li  et  al.,  2022a; 
Zhang et al., 2019a).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the context mentions data augmentation which is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. While this doesn't directly address data bias, it can help improve the generalizability of the model by increasing the diversity of the training data. Additionally, the context discusses the use of attention mechanisms and spectral normalization, but these techniques are related to improving the performance of the model rather than addressing data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
