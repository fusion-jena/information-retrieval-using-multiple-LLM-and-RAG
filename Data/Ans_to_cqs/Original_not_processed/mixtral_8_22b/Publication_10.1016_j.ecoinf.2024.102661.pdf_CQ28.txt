Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown remark-
able stability and effectiveness in big data analytics (Bai et al., 2019; 
Bhardwaj  and  Khaiter,  2023).  Recently,  these  techniques  have  been 
increasingly  applied  to  carbon  emission  forecasting,  showcasing  their 
broad utility (Table 1). Among these, Backpropagation Neural Networks 
(BPNN) stand out for their widespread use and notable forecast accuracy 
(Lin et al., 2021; Niu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2023). Yet, more recent 
studies have highlighted that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural 
networks  outperform  other  models  in  both  forecast  accuracy  and 
training  efficiency  (Kumar,  2023;  Liu  et  al.,  2024b;  Shi  et  al.,  2023). 
Furthermore,  LSTM  have  been  recognized  for  their  ability  to  adeptly 
handle multiple time-variable inputs, exhibiting superior accuracy and 
stability compared to traditional machine learning models (Gokul et al.,

4. Conclusions 

The  primary  objectives  of  this  research  are  to  develop  a  compre-
hensive methodology for calculating ACE and to establish an effective 
deep learning approach for accurately forecasting ACE. Specifically, the 
main findings of this research include:  

(1)  Calculation of ACE for 31 provinces in mainland China from 1993 
to 2021, covering four main agricultural activities: farm opera-
tion,  crop  growth,  enteric  fermentation,  and  manure  manage-
ment. Using these data, the TPEBO-LSTM model based on deep 
learning methods demonstrates superior performance, indicating 
the  potential  of  this  novel  methodology  to  adeptly  manage 
diverse data types and enhance ACE forecasting.  

(2)  Forecasting  of  ACE  peaking  before  2030  in  24  provinces,  with 
notable exceptions. The study identifies significant contributors 
to  ACE  and  predicts  future  high-ACE  provinces,  implications 
critical for developing low-carbon agricultural policies.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the model was deployed using platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
