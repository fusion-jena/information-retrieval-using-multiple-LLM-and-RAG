dataset for training is costly, the learning of CNNs on small datasets can be boosted by data-augmentation, which 
consists of increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, and additionally by transfer learning, which 
consists of starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather from scratch38,39.

rocks” (Data S1). Whale images for training the CNN were mainly aerial images. For step-2, the training dataset 
contains 700 aerial images, with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box 
(the total number of bounding boxes is 945).

Preliminaries on CNN models for image classification and object detection in images.  Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms able to learn from a training dataset to 
make predictions on new examples called testset. They are built using a hierarchical architecture of increasing 
sophistication, each level of this hierarchy is called layer. One of their main particularities is their capacity to 
extract the existent features from data automatically without the need of external hand crafted features. Under the 
supervised learning paradigm, DNNs provide a powerful framework when trained on a large number of labelled 
samples.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does discuss the use of a custom dataset containing 700 aerial images of whales for training a CNN model. This dataset was created specifically for the task of detecting whales in aerial images. Additionally, the text mentions that the construction of a dataset for training is often costly but can be improved through techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning.
