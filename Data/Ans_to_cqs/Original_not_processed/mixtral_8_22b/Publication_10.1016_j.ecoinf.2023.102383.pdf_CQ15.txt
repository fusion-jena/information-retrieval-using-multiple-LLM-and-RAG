compressed,  reducing  to  only  a  few  pixels  in  deeper  CNN  layers.  For 
instance, an object with dimensions of 15 × 15 pixels in a UAV thermal 
image might be represented by just 1 pixel in the feature map from Layer 
4 of ResNet152 (refer to Fig. 4). The limited spatial resolution can lead to 
loss of fine details, making it difficult for the model to distinguish small 
objects from the background. Through FPN, different feature maps from 
different layers can complement each other, and deeper feature map can 
receive some spatial information from shallower layers. However, still 
certain  spatial  features  might  have  been  lost  during  the  process  of 
convolution operations. Consequently, the models of FRC_ResNet18FPN 
and FRC_ResNet34FPN can obtain higher AP for medium and large ob-
jects than the remaining models because they have less CNN layers than 
others.  Notably,  the  FRC_ResNet152FPN  obtains  the  best  detection

For deep learning-based object detection, two fundamental elements, 
feature  maps  and  anchor  boxes,  play  critical  roles.  Feature  maps  are 
extracted from original images and utilized to identify potential objects 
of  interest  and  locate  their  rough  positions  within  an  image.  Subse-
quently, anchor boxes come into play for generating regions of interest 
(RoIs)  and  facilitating  bounding  box  regression,  which  enables  the 
refinement of RoIs to better match the bounding box of the objects of 
interest. In the general definition of CNNs, the CNN layers that are closer 
to the input layer are called shallower layers, while deeper layers are 
those more distant  from the  input  layer. In the  architecture of  object 
detection,  various  CNNs—such  as  ResNet18,  ResNet34,  ResNet50, 
ResNet101, and ResNet152—differ in the overall depth of their layers. 
These CNNs are used to extract feature maps from the original imagery.

3.2. Multi-scale feature map construction 

Feature maps are generated by applying a convolutional layer to the 
input image or the feature map output of the prior layers. For an object 
detection  model,  feature  maps  are  utilized  to  locate  the  positions  of 
objects and classify them into specific classes. The original Faster R-CNN 
in (Ren et al., 2016) adopted VGG16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) as 
its backbone network to extract feature information from input images. 
Specifically, the output of a convolutional layer within the VGG16 was

In the original Faster R-CNN, only a single feature map is utilized, 
and all RoIs acquire their feature information from this common source. 
Thus, there is no ambiguity in feature map selection. However, utilizing 
a  FPN  built  upon  a  residual  neural  network,  it  becomes  possible  to 
extract  five  feature  maps  with  different  resolutions  from  a  thermal 
image captured by a UAV. Based on the small anchor boxes defined in 
Section 3.3, RPN can utilize these multi-scale feature maps to predict 
RoIs with various aspect ratios, leading to improved detection perfor-
mance of small objects. However, when utilizing Fast R-CNN, as illus-
trated in Fig. 3 (b), for classifying these RoIs, a question arises: for a 
given RoI, which feature map should be selected to provide the feature 
information? Normally, the criterion is mainly based on the scale, size, 
and  spatial  characteristics  of  each  RoI.  In  general,  a  larger  RoI  is
