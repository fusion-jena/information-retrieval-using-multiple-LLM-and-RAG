In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

input  predictors  was  independent  of  the  machine  learning  algorithm 
used in the training.

Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in this case. None of the sources mentioned provide details about whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources were employed during the training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model based solely on these references.
