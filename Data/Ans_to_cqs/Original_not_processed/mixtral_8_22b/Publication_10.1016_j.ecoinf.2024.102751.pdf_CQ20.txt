Therefore, it seems reasonable to test in the future more advanced
methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture at the spoil heap. It
would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine
learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to in-
crease the accuracy of prediction.

5. Conclusion

The study explored development spatial modeling for estimating
VWC on reclaimed spoil heap. This model is an integration of remote
sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices.
The key findings include:

• The model suggests that grassland shows exhibits high VWC, con-
firming importance of vegetation cover in water storage capacity.
• The developed model provides a useful foundation for understanding
water retention patterns on the coal mining heap, aiding the recla-
mation planning, and monitoring the success of the restoration.
• Investigating temporal VWC dynamics using time-series satellite
imagery will reveal seasonal and inter-annual variations. The
model’s applicability can be assessed by extending it to other post-
mining sites or regions. Integrating the model into decision support
tools will enable real-time monitoring and management of post-
mining landscapes. Exploring machine learning algorithms could
further improve predictive power and uncover hidden relationships
within the dataset.
