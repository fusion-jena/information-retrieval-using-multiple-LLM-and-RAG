The parameter setting method of SVM in this study was done ac-
cording to the sensitivity analysis method in (Heydari and Mountrakis,
2018). The “kernelType” was set to “RBF” (Gaussian function). For the
“gamma” parameter in the RBF kernel, we tested values of 0.01, 0.1,
0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300. For the “cost” parameter in SVM,
we tested values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. We randomly se-
lected 50% reference data for parameter optimization. By selecting the
highest overall accuracy achieved from diﬀerent parameter combina-
tions, this study set “gamma” and “cost” to 2 and 10 respectively.

Capturing these three stages with spectral data should further enhance
the spectral separability between paddy rice and others.

Helpful Answer:
In this study, the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model were optimized using a sensitivity analysis method described by Heydari and Mountrakis (2018). Specifically, they used a grid search approach to find the best combination of parameters for their model. They tested different values for two main parameters: 'gamma' and 'cost'. For 'gamma', they tried values ranging from 0.01 to 300, while for 'cost', they tested values from 0.1 to 50. To evaluate each combination of parameters, they selected 50% of the reference data for parameter optimization. Finally, they chose the combination of 'gamma' and 'cost' that resulted in the highest overall accuracy. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how the hyperparameters of other models like Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) or deep learning with Ppf-CM were optimized.
