where fm is the m’th tree. This technique is named bagging, which stands 
for  bootstrap  aggregating  (Breiman,  1996).  The  basic  idea  behind 
bagging is to average models containing errors but approximately un-
biased, so as to reduce the variance of an estimated forecast function. 
Decision trees are ideal candidates for bagging because they can capture 
complex interaction structures present in the data and, if grown with 
sufficient depth, have relatively low bias.

ETa), where DOY is the Day Of the Year and the actual evapotranspi-
ration  ETa  represents  the  variable  of  interest.  This  feature  has  854 
missing values, and for this reason, the proposed neural network models 
are exploited for ETa  predictions and gap-filling. The climate variables 
and consequently the ETo feature have only three missing values in the 
dataset,  while  the  SWC,  and  VIs  features  have  56  and  1179  missing 
values, respectively, over the four years of observation. 

3.3. Machine learning models

random  vectors.  This  technique  is  part  of  ensemble  learning  that  has 
made  significant  improvements in  learning accuracy  for classification 
and regression tasks (Breiman, 2001). A random subset of the features is 
chosen at each candidate split during the learning process when using 
random forests, which employ a modified tree learning algorithm (Ho, 
1998). Each decision tree within the RF is constructed and trained from 
a random subset of the data in the training set. Therefore, the trees do 
not use the complete set, and at each node the best attribute is chosen 
from  a  randomly  selected  set  of  attributes  (thus,  not  necessarily  the 
absolute best attribute). For example, given the training dataset (X, Y), 
with each element xi ∈ X ∈ R,yi ∈ Y ∈ R, one can train M different trees 
on  different  subsets,  chosen  randomly  with  replacement,  and  then 
compute the ensemble average:

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the concept of bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregating, which is a technique used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing their variance. Bagging involves creating multiple instances of a predictor and combining them to produce improved results. In the case of decision trees, this means building multiple trees on different subsets of the data and averaging their outputs. While this approach does not directly address data bias, it can help mitigate its effects by reducing the impact of outliers and improving overall model stability. Additionally, the text mentions the use of random forests, which is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. Random forests work by selecting a random subset of features at each candidate split during the learning process, which helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization. Again, while this technique does not specifically target data bias, it can indirectly contribute to addressing it by producing more robust and reliable models.
