by a running average of its recent magnitude to speed
up training (Tieleman and Hinton 2012). The batch size
is ﬁxed to 32. We check the training loss every 50 epochs
and stop the training when the value of the loss function
fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The model
with the optimal objective function value is chosen.

In the most interesting case, when the query sequences
are novel (i.e., are not in the training set), both DEPP
and EPA-ng greatly outperform APPLES+JC (Fig. 4a).
On average, the placement error of DEPP (2.17 edges)
and EPA-ng (2.15 edges) is much lower than APPLES+JC
(3.34 edges). Moreover, EPA-ng and DEPP have low error
about the same number of times (respectively, 89% and
88% of DEPP and EPA-ng placements have four edges or
less error). However, DEPP is less often far away from
the optimal placement. For example, on average, the
maximum error of DEPP for each gene is seven edges
lower than EPA-ng; or, the placement error of EPA-ng is
larger than 15 edges in 3.1% of cases compared to 2.4%
for DEPP. Thus, just like the simulated data set, DEPP
has fewer cases of high error.

Evaluation on Simulated Data Sets
DEPP training and parameter sensitivity.—We start by
evaluating DEPP on simulated data sets, testing the
ability to train the CNN model in reasonable times. As
the training epochs advance, the loss function (1) drops
rapidly and stabilizes after around 500 epochs in a typical
case (Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material available on
Dryad). Here, training, which is a one-time process for
each reference tree, ﬁnished in around 20 min for the 200-
taxon data set and 260 minutes for 10,000-taxon data set,
on a machine with one 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU
cores. Placement of 1000 queries took 4 seconds for the
200-taxon and 30 s for the 10,000-taxon data sets using a
single CPU core. On the small 200-taxon data set, EPA-ng
has an advantage in terms of running time. However, in
the larger HGT data set (10,000-taxon), DEPP placements
are faster than the alternatives with half the running time
of EPA-ng. In terms of the memory usage, APPLES+JC

Placement.—Once the CNN model is trained, we use it to
map a given query sequence q to a vector of distances
D1 ...Dn. For data sets with missing data (gaps), we
compute two sets of distances,
1,
using the models with and without gap reconstruction,
respectively. The ﬁnal distances is set to the weighted
i , where �
sum of the distances, that is, (1
is the proportion of the sites with gaps in the query
sequences. The weighted sum is used to reduce the
impact of reconstructed bases (which are guessed, as
opposed to being observed) on the ﬁnal distance and
will be empirically tested. Given these distances, we then
place q onto T using distance-based placement (Balaban
et al. 2020), which uses dynamic programming to ﬁnd the
dqi(T))2,
placement with the minimum
where dqi(T) represents the tree-based distance between
(cid:30)
the query and each taxon i (Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does indicate that the training process employs a form of gradient descent optimizer, specifically RMSProp, which is mentioned as being used with a decaying learning rate schedule. This information can be inferred from the statement that mentions the use of RMSProp with a decaying learning rate schedule to speed up training, referencing a paper by Tieleman and Hinton published in 2012. Therefore, based on this context, we can conclude that the deep learning pipeline utilizes RMSProp as its optimization technique.
