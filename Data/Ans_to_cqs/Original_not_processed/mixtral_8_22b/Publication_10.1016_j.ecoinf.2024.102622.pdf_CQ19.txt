Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model for identifying rice diseases or estimating chlorophyll content. The papers cited do not provide details about the use of any particular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which framework was used to develop these models.
