where TP is the number of true (correct) positive (presence) predic-
tions, TN is the number of correct negative (absence) predictions, FP is
the number of false positive predictions and FN is the number of false
negative predictions.

Other metrics used are Precision, Recall, and the F-measure.
Precision is deﬁned as the fraction of relevant/correct instances among
the retrieved instances for a class, while Recall is the fraction of re-
levant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of

relevant instances. In terms of the same counts used above, they can be
expressed as:

(in terms of comparative presence–absence item counts), Accuracy is a
suitable measure for model performance evaluation. Nevertheless, all
applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to
best), for reasons to be explained in Section 4.1.1 below.

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

Cross-validation is an iterative method for calculating the expected
value of a particular measure. It splits the dataset into K equally-sized
parts that are called folds. In each iteration, diﬀerent (K − 1)-folds are
used for training and the remaining fold for testing. The overall mea-
sure of its performance is the average of the measures of the individual
iterations. The above method guarantees that every instance will be
used both for training and testing. There is an alternative of cross-va-
lidation method called stratiﬁed cross-validation, where in each fold a
balanced number of instances for each class is selected. For our ex-
perimentation, we used stratiﬁed cross-validation with K = 10 folds.

4. Experiments

In this section, we perform two experiments. First, we are trying to
predict the existence of seagrass, and then its family. We are also in-
terested on which variables aﬀecting those predictions most.

Helpful Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, one common criterion mentioned in machine learning literature is the validation loss plateau. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or remains constant after several epochs, it might indicate that the model has learned enough from the data and further training could lead to overfitting. Other possible criteria include reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs, achieving a target accuracy level, or observing no improvement in the validation metric for a certain number of epochs. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined exactly what criteria were used in this case.
