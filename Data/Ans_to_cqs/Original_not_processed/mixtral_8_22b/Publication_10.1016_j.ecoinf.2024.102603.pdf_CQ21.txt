structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh 
et  al., 2022]. The divergence extends  to computational requirements, 
where deep learning models typically demand more resources, including 
GPUs  (Graphics  Processing  Units)  or  TPUs  (Tensor  Processing  Units),

the examined population is recorded and utilized by the next tree in line 
to improve the previous results. 

To assess the model's performance, we used the leave-one-out pro-
cedure for cross-validation [Hastie et al., 2001]. It maximizes the use of 
available data, reduces bias in performance estimation, and is particu-
larly  useful  for  small  datasets,  as  it  rigorously  assesses  model  perfor-
mance by iterative training on all but one sample and evaluating the 
excluded  sample.  The  following  metrics  were  calculated  for  model 
performance:  the  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  as  well  as  Mean 
Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative 
Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).

and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

Helpful Answer: After the completion of model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific application and type of model used. In this case, the authors have mentioned using the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. This method involves training the model on all samples except one, then testing it on the excluded sample. This process is repeated until each sample has been left out once. To measure the model's performance, various metrics were calculated, including R^2, MAE, RMSE, and RRMSE. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions. Other common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, which highlight important features in the input data that contribute to the model's output, and creating confusion matrices, which summarize the classification performance of the model. However, these methods were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
