features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

of CNN architectures, and adjust network layers and hyperparameters to 
predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. More-
over,  categorizing  research  findings  based  on  the  timing  of  policy  or 
management  interventions  could  elucidate  the  evolving  factors  and 
patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms. 

5. Conclusions

distribution of algal blooms, this study leverages remote sensing data in 
conjunction  with  CNNs,  applying  the  AlexNet  architecture  to  water 
quality classification to address the challenges posed by the heteroge-
neous water conditions in Lake Dianchi. Additionally, our research is 
distinguished  by  its  integration  of  a  broader  range  of  environmental 
factors, including both meteorological and water quality parameters, to 
assess their collective impact on algal bloom formation. This multifac-
eted analysis offers a more nuanced understanding compared to Wang 

et al. (2021c), who primarily focused on the response relationship be-
tween  algal  blooms  and  environmental  factors,  providing  a  more 
detailed insight.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a CNN model architecture and various components such as convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. However, it does not provide any details about the deployment platform.
