TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source software platform (Abadi et al. 2016) 
that supports deep learning research and applications, having been 
released  by  researchers  at  Google  (Google  Brain  Team;  https://re-
search.google.com/teams/brain/).  We  adapted  and  configured 
TensorFlow  for  application  and  use  in  our  project  via  Python. We 
adjusted  two  parameters  from  their  default  values:  validation  per-
centage and number of training steps. Although the default setting 
for validation percentage was 10%, given small numbers of images 
available for some species, we had to increase this number to 16%. 
For number of training steps, although the default value was 4000 
steps,  we  explored  different  numbers  and  compared  the  results  to 
find  the  optimum  balance  between  computing  time  and  classifica-
tion efficiency.

A  crucial  advantage  of  using  TensorFlow  was  eliminating  the 
need for preprocessing images for our identification system. That is, 
we  compared TensorFlow  classification  performance  based  on  the 
cleaned  and  raw  images  for  the  Mexican  species,  which  were  the 
most challenging to our statistical classifiers (Gurgel-Gonçalves et al.

We  calibrated  our  models  for  Mexican  and  Brazilian  spe-
cies  using  different  numbers  of  training  steps,  and  considered  two 
factors  to  find  optima  for  training TensorFlow  (Fig.  2):  1)  correct 
identification rate, which improved up to a certain point, but then 
reached  a  plateau,  beyond  which  we  saw  no  significant  improve-
ment,  and  2)  processing  time  (in  hours),  which  showed  a  positive 
linear relationship with number of training steps. For the Mexican 
dataset, with 12 species, 2,000 emerged as an optimum number of 
training steps, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate 
(Fig. 2); the largest gap between the processing time trace and iden-
tification  rate  occurred  following  this  number  of  steps. Above  this 
number of training steps, subtle improvements in identification rate

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that one of the advantages of using TensorFlow was eliminating the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. This suggests that the authors did not perform any extensive image preprocessing tasks such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before feeding them into the TensorFlow model. Instead, they directly compared TensorFlow's classification performance based on cleaned and raw images for Mexican species. The only adjustments made to TensorFlow's settings were increasing the validation percentage from 10% to 16% due to limited available images for some species and exploring different numbers of training steps to optimize the tradeoff between computation time and classification efficiency.
