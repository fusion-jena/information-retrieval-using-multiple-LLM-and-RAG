by class sample size. We used the SGD (stochastic gradient descent) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 
0.01 for all models except MansNet, which was initially set at 0.1. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 
10 after steps of 30 epochs. We used batch normalization and models were trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia 
Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs.

information passes through the end of the network. (1) ResNet-10128 was proposed to address this problem by 
using skip connections that allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers (or residual blocks) and thus 
penetrate much further into deep networks. (2) Wide-ResNet-10129, on the other hand, is wider but shallower 
than ResNet-101. This difference in architecture allows information to more easily pass through the network 
while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance. (3)  InceptionV330 has fewer layers but 
achieves  greater  computational  efficiency  by,  for  example,  using  factorized  convolution,  which  breaks  down 
channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image. (4) MnasNet-A131 
was designed to be faster for mobile devices and thus has the fewest layers of the models compared here. The

Model training.  To speed up the training process, we used models pre-trained on the ImagNet  database32 
and then retrained them for bumble bee species classification using our image data set. We divided our full data 
set into training (80%) and test (20%) groups. After randomly shuffling images in each class (species) we split 
the images within species along the 80:20 ratio to maintain their proportional representations in the training 
and test groups. For each model, cropped images were resampled to a standard size for model input. Following 
the original implementation of these models, we used images of 224 × 224 pixels for ResNet, Wide-Resnet, and 
MnasNet, and 299 × 299 pixels for InceptionV3. We used an image augmentation strategy that included random 
rotation (≤ 100°), crop (≤ 10%), sheer (≤ 30%) and horizontal flip to help reduce overfitting and improve the 
generality of our  models33. To help account for the class imbalance in our data set, predictions were weighted

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies that can indirectly mitigate the effects of randomness. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: By applying various transformations like rotation, crop, shear, and horizontal flip, the model becomes exposed to different variations of the same image during training. This helps in reducing overfitting and improving the generalizability of the models.

2. Pretraining: Using models pre-trained on the ImageNet database before fine-tuning them for specific tasks reduces the impact of random initialization. Since the weights have already been learned from a vast dataset, they serve as a better starting point for further training.

3. Batch Normalization: This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, making the optimization landscape smoother and reducing the sensitivity to parameter initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, helping to prevent overfitting.

4. Learning Rate Schedule: Instead of keeping the learning rate constant throughout training, it is often beneficial to decrease it gradually. This approach, known as learning rate decay, can stabilize the training process and lead to better convergence.

While these techniques do not directly address the issue of controlling randomness due to factors like random seed values, they contribute to building robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
