3.2. Results of the FAIR assessment of the datasets selected by the F-UJI 
tool 

The  results  obtained  using  the  F-UJI  tool  were  based  on  the  16 
metrics described previously, which were established in the FAIRsFAIR 
project and distributed among four principles. 

Following the analysis of each group of repositories using this tool, 
we  passed  the  results  through  a  computational  notebook  report, 

ultimately  obtaining  visualisations  of  the  summaries  of  each  FAIR 
principle for all eight repositories. 

The report itself contained two sections:  

1.  “Read jsons responses” creates a data frame that includes all scores 

obtained for each of the 16 metrics,  

2.  “Visualize different FAIR metrics”  creates a histogram plot of the 
results that includes visualisations of each principle and the overall 
FAIR score, as shown below (Figs. 4(cid:0) 11).

Using F-UJI and conducting this study was possible because its cre-
ators made the code necessary to evaluate a large number of datasets 
quickly  and  automatically  available  to  the  scientific  community, 
without having to enter each identifier individually. Therefore, we were 
able  to  install  our  own  server  using  the  latest  version  of  the  code 
available on GitHub. In this way, compliance with the FAIR principles of 
6288 datasets related to the agricultural field was evaluated, and the 
results  indicated  that,  from  highest  to  lowest,  compliance  with  the 
principles  followed  the  same  alphabetical  order  as  the  principles 
themselves, with findability being the highest rated and reusability the 
lowest. None of the repositories analysed reached 50% of the score for 
the  reusability  principle;  therefore,  it  is  important  to  investigate  the 
causes  of  this  low  score  and,  at  the  same  time,  seek  mechanisms  for

store and disseminate a genomic data archive that complies with FAIR 
principles  in  terms  of  metadata  traceability  and  dataset  citability,  in 
accordance with Open Science  recommendations. Another example is 
the work of Wise et al. (2019) on the benefits of FAIR for research and 
development in the biopharmaceutical industry and other life sciences, 
such  as  biomedical,  environmental,  agricultural,  and  food  sciences. 
According to these studies, industry investment in following the FAIR 
principles could be a differentiating factor with respect to how data are 
exploited both internally and externally by other actors. Additionally, 
one line of research that promotes the advantages of FAIR principles and 
highlighted the shortcomings pertaining to their application is the work 
of Kinkade and Shepherd (2021) on the publication of geoscience data. 
Among  the  primary  conclusions  of  these  authors  are  claims  that  the

natives  is  urgent.  One  response  to  this  need  is  the  development  of 
automatic tools for the management of datasets and the assessment of 
compliance with FAIR principles. One such tool is F-UJI, whose acronym 
includes the components “F” for FAIR and “UJI” for “Test” (in Malay), 
which  was  created as  part of the  FAIRsFAIR project. According  to its 
creators, the goal of the F-UJI is to evaluate FAIRness beyond the level of 
an object (dataset) itself (Devaraju and Huber, 2021b). For this purpose, 
it is important that, as in Huber et al. (2021), all components of the data 
ecosystem  (ranging  from  the  datasets  to  the  accompanying  metadata 
and  the  repositories  that  host  them)  are  prepared  for  machine  read-
ability, because F-UJI’s automated testing relies heavily on the clarity 
and  evaluability  of  these  criteria  in  computing  environments  by  any 
person or group. One of the most valuable contributions of the F-UJI is

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature extraction. Normalization involves rescaling values to fit within a certain range, while scaling adjusts the scale of features so they have similar magnitudes. Cleaning removes noise and outliers from the data, and feature extraction transforms raw data into more meaningful representations. These steps help improve the performance and accuracy of deep learning models.

Based on the given context, I cannot provide detailed information regarding the preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, some commonly employed techniques include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature extraction.

Normalization is a technique where the input values are adjusted to fall within a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. This process helps prevent variables with larger scales from dominating those with smaller ones during the training phase. Scaling, on the other hand, modifies the scale of features to ensure they possess comparable magnitudes. This step can significantly impact the convergence rate of optimization algorithms utilized in deep learning models.

Cleaning refers to the removal of noisy or irrelevant data points, including outliers, missing values, and duplicates. By eliminating these unwanted elements, the quality of the dataset improves, leading to better model performance. Lastly, feature extraction entails converting raw data into more informative representations, often reducing dimensionality and enhancing interpretability.

These preprocessing steps play a crucial role in improving the efficiency and precision of deep learning models. Nevertheless, the choice of methods depends largely on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset.
