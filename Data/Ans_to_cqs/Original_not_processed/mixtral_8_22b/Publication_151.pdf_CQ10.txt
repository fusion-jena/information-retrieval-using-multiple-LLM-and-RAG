that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate
that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that take
advantage of both sources of data. [Deep learning; gene tree discordance; metagenomics; microbiome analyses; neural
networks; phylogenetic placement.]

Phylogenetic placement offers a way to use general
purpose models without simulations. Given a reference
tree, however computed, and sequence data which are
a function of the tree, we can use the reference data
to train a machine learning model (such as a DNN)
that can place a query sequence onto the reference tree.
The reference tree may be a species tree inferred using
large numbers of genes, using complex models, and
perhaps after spending much computational resources.
Such reference data are increasingly available. For
example, several comprehensive trees were published
recently with tens of thousands of microbial species
(Zhu et al. 2019; Asnicar et al. 2020; Parks et al.
2020) using 120–400 genes, with analyses that took
>200,000 h of CPU and GPU time in one case. These
available trees are excellent candidates for providing the
training data.

the gene tree and eq,n is the number of branches between queries and species i on species tree.

Examining example trees shows that these cases of
high error tend to correspond to novel query taxa; that
is, those on long branches on sparsely sampled clades
(Fig. S3 of the Supplementary material available on
Dryad). Queries with higher terminal branch lengths
lead to higher error (Fig. S4 of the Supplementary
material available on Dryad); however, it appears that
the shortest of branches also have a higher error, perhaps
because distinguishing very similar taxa requires strong
signal. Similarly, queries with a large clade as the sister
tend to be more difﬁcult for DEPP (Fig. S4 of the
Supplementary material available on Dryad). Trees that
lead to high error tend to have long terminal branches
and short branches close to the root, a condition that
corresponds to rapid radiations; in contrast, easy cases
are those with shorter terminal branches and long
branches closer to the root (Fig. S3 of the Supplementary
material available on Dryad).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention or indication of the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the source code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, I recommend checking the original research paper or contacting the authors directly for access to their code repository.
