%Query
Query: "Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited in this bibliography cover various topics related to unmanned aircraft systems, their use in wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring using acoustic monitoring and deep learning. However, none of these sources explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in this bibliography, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models.
