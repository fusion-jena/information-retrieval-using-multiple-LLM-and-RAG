2.2. Transformer-like model 

Transformer  was  proposed  by  Vaswani  et  al.  (2017)  and  initially 
designed for Seq2Seq tasks, replacing long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with a full-attention structure. It was primarily applied in NLP, and both 
the  transformer  and  its  subsequent  iterations  demonstrated  excellent 
performance in a wide range of downstream tasks. With the success of 
the transformer in NLP, researchers have begun to explore its applica-
tion in CV. 

The core structure of the transformer-like visual model is an encoder 
module, which comprises several stacked blocks. Each block consists of 
two  components:  a  token  mixer  module  (Yu  et  al.,  2022)  for  fusing 
spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. 
The main distinction among the different transformer-like visual models 
lies in the variations in the token mixer module. For example, the token 
mixer in a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is a self-attention module.

Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

The  selected  CNN-like  model  was  ResNet-50  (He  et  al.,  2016),  as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). It comprises four stages, each containing three, four, 
six, and three blocks, with each block consisting of three convolutional 
layers. In addition, there is an independent convolutional layer at the 
start of the network and a fully connected layer at the end for classifi-
cation, resulting in 50 layers.

The two transformer-like models used were ViT-S/16 (Dosovitskiy 
et al., 2020) and Volo-d1 (Yuan et al., 2022), and their architectures are 
shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. The encoder of the ViT-S/16 is 
stacked  with  12  transformer  blocks,  each  containing  a  self-attention 
structure  serving  as  the  token  mixer.  The  Volo-d1  model  begins  by 
downsampling the input image through four convolutional layers and 
subsequently extracting the features in two stages. Stage 1 consists of 
four Outlooker blocks, with the token mixer being the Outlook Attention 
module with a window size of 3 × 3, whereas Stage 2 consists of 14 
transformer blocks. 

The  MLP-like  model  used  was  ViP-Small/7  (Hou  et  al.,  2022),  as 
shown in Fig. 2(d). The input image is divided into 7 × 7 image patches 
and linearly projected onto token embeddings, which are subsequently 
fed into  a  sequence of Permutator  blocks for feature extraction.  Each

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on image data within the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context discusses various models such as ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7, all of which are designed for processing images or image patches. However, the context does not explicitly mention other types of data formats like audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can infer that the primary data format used in these deep learning pipelines is image data.
