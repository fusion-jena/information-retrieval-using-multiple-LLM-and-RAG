Our  deep-learning  models  used  NASnet  architecture  (Zoph  et  al., 
2017) with a Faster-rcnn backbone (Ren et al., 2015) implemented in 
Tensorflow2. The parameters of the model can be found on TensorFlow 
model zoo1 under the name “faster_rcnn_nas”. All images were resized to 
1333 × 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset 
(Lin et al., 2014)) used to prepare the first layers of our model and save 
computing time during the training phase). We used a learning rate of 
0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. For each K-fold, the model was 
trained on its own version of Trainingclips  through 200,000 iterations, 
with a batch size of 16 images per iteration. The training was completed 
in 96 h  per model using a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000. In 
order  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  deep-learning  models,  we 
computed the recall, precision, and F-measure for each model. Briefly, a

Helpful Answer:
The deep learning model used in this study employed the NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2. The specific parameters of the model can be found in the TensorFlow Model Zoo under the name "faster\_rcnn\_nas". The learning rate used was 0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. The model was trained through 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 images per iteration. However, the exact details about other hyperparameters such as the optimizer, weight initialization, regularization techniques, etc., are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
