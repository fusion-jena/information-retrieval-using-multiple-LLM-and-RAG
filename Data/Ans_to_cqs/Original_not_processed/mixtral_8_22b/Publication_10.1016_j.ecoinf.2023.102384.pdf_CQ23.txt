where  N  stands  for  the  number  of  images  belonging  to  the  test  split, 
while cn
pred refer to the ground truth and the predicted numbers of 
insects present in the n-th image, respectively. It's important to highlight 
that, due to the squaring of differences, the MSE places more weight on 
larger errors, including outliers. Conversely, the MARE also considers 
how the error relates to the total object count in the image. This metric 
holds particular significance in our PST dataset, where the insect count 
exhibits significant variation across images. 

Localization Analysis. While the MAE, MSE, and MARE serve as fair 
metrics  for  comparing  counting  performance  and  are  considered  the 
gold  standard  for  this  task,  they  can  sometimes  mask  erroneous  esti-
mations. The reason behind this is that they do not account for where the

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of a test split from the dataset, which suggests some form of data partitioning or splitting was employed. Data partitioning is often used to create training, validation, and testing sets, allowing models to be evaluated on unseen data and helping prevent overfitting. Additionally, the mention of a non-publicly available dataset implies that the authors may have had access to diverse data sources, contributing to the robustness and potential generalizability of their model. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the nature of the dataset, the exact methods used for data partitioning, or any additional techniques such as cross-validation or stratified sampling, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
