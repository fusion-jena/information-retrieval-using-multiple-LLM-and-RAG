2. Public weed dataset survey 

Weed datasets were surveyed based on a systematic search in major 
databases including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE 
Xplore, and arXiv. The search keywords included “weed dataset”, “weed 
database”,  “agriculture”,  “machine  vision”  and  “computer  vision”. 
Particularly,  to  facilitate searching  via  Google  Scholar,  the  Python  li-
brary “scholarly”3  was employed to automatically retrieve publication 
records. A total of 451 records were collected from the literature search,

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning models mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used without additional information.
