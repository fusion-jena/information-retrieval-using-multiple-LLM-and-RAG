Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh 
et  al., 2022]. The divergence extends  to computational requirements, 
where deep learning models typically demand more resources, including 
GPUs  (Graphics  Processing  Units)  or  TPUs  (Tensor  Processing  Units),

and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

either  a  larger  footprint  size,  as  seen  with  instruments  such  as  the 
TROPOspheric  Monitoring  Instrument  (SENTINEL-5P  TROPOMI),  The 
SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartog-
raphY (ENVISAT SCIAMACHY), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 
(GOME-2) or spatially and sparse disjointed registrations from satellites 
like Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Car-
bon  Observatory-2  (OCO-2).  Nevertheless,  SIF  retrievals  can  identify 
unexpected  instrumental  issues  that  may  impact  other  retrieval  pro-
cesses, given their high sensitivity to additional offsets in radiances, as 
identified by Frankenberg et al. (2011). The cause, involving a thin ice 
layer  on  the  image-sensing  instrument,  has  been  recognized  by  Crisp 
et al., 2017and Sun et al. (2017).

photosynthesis downregulation. Although algorithms have been devel-
oped to detect patterns from satellite data for chlorophyll fluorescence 
retrieval and mapping, they are still in the developmental stage [Sinha 
et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2023]. The most recent advancements in machine 
learning techniques for chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval from Sentinel 
or Landsat imaging sensors have primarily focused on inland and coastal 
waterbodies and wetlands [Smith et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 2022; 
Bartold and Kluczek, 2023]. It is crucial to evaluate emerging machine 
learning  techniques to  effectively analyze  and map  the  changing  pat-
terns of plant chlorophyll fluorescence in wetlands, particularly when 
using satellite data from EO Programs.
