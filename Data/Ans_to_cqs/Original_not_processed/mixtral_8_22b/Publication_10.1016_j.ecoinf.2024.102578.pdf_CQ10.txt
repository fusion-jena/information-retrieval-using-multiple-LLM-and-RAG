et  al.,  2023). Our workflow  reduces  the  load by  ~62 h,  however the 
amount of time required to develop the site-specific models and work-
flow took ~160 h. It would take approximately 960 k processed images 
to recover the time invested in developing the workflow, which makes 
sense  for  long-term  projects  where  the  initial  investment  of  time  is 
recouped over the life of the project.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

According to the given information, the code and detailed instructions for the deep learning pipeline are available on GitHub. However, the exact link to the repository was not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the specific GitHub repository containing the code for the deep learning pipeline.

However, considering the author's name and the repository name mentioned in the article, one could infer that the potential link might look like this: <https://github.com/gerlis22/CameraTrap>. Please note that this is only speculation based on the limited information provided, and the actual link may vary. To obtain the correct link or access the code, please contact the authors directly or refer to their published paper.
