5. Discussion 

In this study we developed a workflow which leveraged citizen sci-
ence data to extract further relevant records from social media posts in 
the  same  region.  The  workflow  functions  as  a  data  filter  enabling 
downsampling of an initially very large dataset into a human analysable 
subset - in our case containing 0.5% of the original posts. By massively 
reducing  data  volumes,  it  becomes  realistic  to  analyse  the  remaining 
data by hand to select true positives, with around one hour required for 
the  4000  or  so  candidate  posts  we  identified.  Our  workflow  thus  ad-
dresses  the  research  gap  identified  by  Burke  et  al.,  2022,  using  gen-
eralisable  methods  to  extract  target  data  from  various,  unverified 
sources to enrich data.

To train our red kite classification model (step 5 in Fig. 2) we needed 
a reliable dataset containing images of birds composed of true positives 
(images of red kites) and true negatives (images of other bird species). 
Since  we  assume  that  citizen  science  data  are  reliable  compared  to 
captions from social media data, we created this dataset using eBird and 
iNaturalist  records  of  red  kites.  Both  eBird  and  iNaturalist  moderate 
content, for example filtering and checking unusual sightings or volumes 
of contribution. 

To access data from eBird, we obtained the metadata for given search 
terms  from  the  official  website  (eBird.,  2021)  and  downloaded  all 
associated “Specimen Page URLs”, which represent individual images. 
For iNaturalist we used a dedicated API,1 similar to the one provided by 
Flickr and a community-driven open source Python library called pyi-
naturalist (No´e, 2022).

In this paper we propose, implement and evaluate a workflow taking 
advantage of citizen science data documenting and recording sightings 
of birds, and more specifically red kites (Milvus milvus). Analysing social 
media data until recently has often used simple keyword-based methods 
to perform an initial filtering or search step, meaning that content tag-
ged in other ways was not found. However, improvements in content- 
based  classification  now  mean  that  it  is  also  possible  to  use  off-the- 
shelf,  pre-trained  algorithms  to  reliably  identify  predefined  classes 
such  as  presence  of  buildings,  people  or  birds  in  image  data  with 
reasonable accuracy. Our workflow uses these improvements, together 
with training data generated from citizen scientists, to identify further 
relevant sightings in a social media dataset using both textual metadata 
and  image  content.  Since  both  datasets  include  metadata  capturing

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not provide explicit information about how they optimize the hyperparameters of their models. They mention using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image analysis but do not discuss specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
