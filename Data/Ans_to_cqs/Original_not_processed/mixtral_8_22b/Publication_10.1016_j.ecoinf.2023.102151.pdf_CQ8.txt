In response to the escalating significance of environmental concerns, 
fostering interdisciplinary integration is crucial for the development of 
innovative and comprehensive solutions. The imperative for educating 
professionals across diverse fields in enhancing dialogue beyond their 
respective  disciplines has never been more pressing. As  landscape ar-
chitects  and  researchers,  we  have  engaged  in  numerous  projects  that 
encompass a broad spectrum of disciplines, acknowledging the pivotal 
role of soil science within various ecological systems. Through collab-
oration with experts in disciplines such as soil science, ecology, water 
management, and urban planning, we have recognized the need for a 
coherent communication approach that efficiently conveys information 
across  these  fields.  Accordingly,  this  paper  proposes  a  visualization 
system utilizing computational algorithms to streamline the visualiza-

The  core  principle  of  node-based  programming  pertains  to  the 
employment of an abstracted node model for the representation of data 
or a computing operator. Each “node” accepts zero or multiple inputs and 
yields outputs subsequent to executing a computing operation. The scope 
of these computational operations encompasses elementary arithmetic 
tasks  as well  as intricate customized functions  necessitating consider-
able computational resources. (Fig. 8). 

The  intricacy  of  project  development  for  users  is  predominantly 
contingent upon the assortment of nodes supplied by both the software 
development  team  (intrinsic  default  functions)  and  community  de-
velopers  (plugin  functions).  A  robust  platform  typically  reaps  the  ad-
vantages  of  an  active  community-driven  ecosystem,  encompassing 
hundreds of plugins contributed by an array of sources. This, in turn, 
enables an extensive scope of functionality and customization for the 
end-users.

retrieved  local  climate  data,  envisions  potential  avenues  to  exploit 
existing  remote  sensing  data  and  web-based  APIs.  For  instance,  the 
utilization of resources such as Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US 
soil moisture data can be beneficial. This could lead to the development 
of integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at 
varying degrees of granularity. Not only would this augment the inter-
operability of our system, but it would also foster enhanced multidis-
ciplinary  communication  at  the  developmental  stage,  consequently 
bolstering  collaborations  across  fields.  Nevertheless,  the  prospect  of 
identifying a unified data framework with global applicability remains 
uncertain to us.

distribution, providing  a  valuable overview for  targeted users or  pro-
fessionals. However, little  research focuses on projects at  the scale of 
building, landscape, or urban block. Resource distribution at such scales 
does  not  vary  significantly  geographically  but  varies  considerably  at 
different depths within the soil. The collected data is limited and does 
not  differ  substantially  on  geographic  maps.  Furthermore,  multidisci-
plinary collaboration across various disciplines is more intense between 
different parties within these projects.
