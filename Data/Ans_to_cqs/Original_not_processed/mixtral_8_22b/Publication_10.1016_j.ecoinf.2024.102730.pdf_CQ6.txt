Despite massive advancements in the field of machine learning (ML)
during the last decade, ML is not yet often used for vegetation studies.
ML models can be used for various tasks, among which are classification,
regression, and image segmentation. In ML, models extract knowledge
from data and use this knowledge to produce an output relevant to the
task at hand. These models use three main learning paradigms: super-
vised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning. This
study only considers the first paradigm, as we build a regression model.
Within supervised learning, there are a multitude of model types, for
example, support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree
ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke
et al., 2017)) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (McCulloch and
Pitts, 1943). This analysis will use ANNs, particularly multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural net-

To evaluate how well the models performed, we used three standard
metrics: MSE, mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of deter-
mination (r2). For the grid search, we focused on minimizing the MSE to
identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Prior to conducting the grid
search, we divided our data into a training set (80% of the data) and a
test set (20% of the data). This split ensures that the models are trained
on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen
portion, allowing us to assess their ability to generalize to new, unseen
data accurately.

2.3.2. Machine learning

To better understand the inter-annual variability in our results, we
used ML techniques to create models predicting different vegetation
phenology characteristics. Specifically, we trained three separate MLPs:
one to predict the start of the season, another to predict the peak of the
season, and a third to predict the height of the peak season. An MLP is a
type of ANN designed to mimic the way the human brain processes in-
formation. It consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons): an input
layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer which is used to
provide the final predictions. Each node in a layer connects to every
node in the next layer, with each connection having a specific weight.
During training, the MLP adjusts these weights to minimize the differ-
ence between its predictions and the actual outcomes using an algorithm
called backpropagation, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data
(Werbos, 1990).

After training the MLP models, we computed SHAP values using the
model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are
most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the
greening season. We used the implementation in the Python SHAP
package for this analysis Lundberg et al. (2017).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible preprocessing steps could include:

* Normalization: Scaling numerical inputs to a range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This helps prevent large input values from dominating the learning process.
* Standardization: Transforming numerical inputs so they have zero mean and unit variance. This can help improve convergence during optimization.
* Cleaning: Removing missing or invalid values from the dataset, handling outliers, and dealing with inconsistent formatting.
* Encoding categorical variables: Converting non-numerical categories into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. Techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding may be employed.

These preprocessing steps were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but are commonly applied when preparing datasets for deep learning models.
