The model was trained again on all the annotated scans earlier and tested on a different
un-annotated dataset. The model performed well, based on visual inspection. In order to
evaluate the performance of the model with an average precision metric, around 200 of
these   scans   were   annotated   by   hand,   based   on   the   predicted   bounding   boxes.   The
predicted bounding boxes dramatically reduced the time to annotate these scans, since the
predictions for leaves and stems were fairly accurate. After being annotated, these scans
were compared with the predictions to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model
on this dataset.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training involved testing the model on a separate un-annotated dataset after retraining it on all the previously annotated scans. Visual inspection was initially used to determine if the model performed well or not. To further evaluate the model's performance using an average precision metric, approximately 200 of these scans were manually annotated based on the predicted bounding boxes. These annotations were then compared with the original predictions to assess the precision of the organ detection model on this new dataset. Additionally, Tables 4 and 5 provide specific metrics such as AP50, AP75, and AP for evaluating the model's performance. However, there is no explicit mention of any real-time monitoring strategies like early stopping or learning rate adjustment during the training process.
