The  numerical  values  of  some  parameters  (Tan  et  al.,  2019)  were 
calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain 
the data mining results. The support parameter measures the abundance 
or  frequency  (often  interpreted  as  important)  of  a  set  of  items  in  a 
database. The value of the support parameter is given by the ratio be-
tween  the  number  of  times  an  item  appears  and  the  total  number  of 
items. We refer to a set of molecules as a “set of frequent molecules” if 
support  exceeds  a  specified  minimum  threshold  we  can  identify.  In 
general, the threshold depends on the size of the dataset.

2.1. Operational workflow 

The whole process of data acquisition and processing, reported in the 
following  section,  is  called  Knowledge  Discovery  in  Databases  (KDD) 
(Kotu and Deshpande, 2015); it is a process of identifying patterns or 
relationships  within  a  dataset  useful  to  make  important  decisions 
(Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014). This process does not involve applying 
data-mining  techniques  but  requires  more  actions  to  reach  the  final 
result. 

The KDD sequence applied in our case study included the following 

steps:  

• identification of the aim for a specific study area;  
• pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective;  
• analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface 

water bodies;  

• optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through:

The Apriori algorithm consists of a sequence of steps for identifying 
the most frequent itemset in a given database (Fig. 2). Two main pro-
cesses  are  performed  iteratively  to  locate  the  most  frequent  itemsets: 
joining and pruning. As the name indicates, join represents the union of 
itemsets,  and  pruning  is  a  data  compression  technique  in  machine 
learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by 
removing  sections  of  the  tree  that  are  non-critical  and  redundant  to 
classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier 
and  improves  the  predictive  accuracy  by  reducing  overfitting  (Zhao 
et al., 2009).
