2021a; Wang et al., 2020c). Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained 
a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 (Red-
mon  and  Farhadi,  2018)  while  detecting  and  classifying  pest  species 
from  the  images  in  their  “Pest24”  dataset.  The  dataset  consisted  of 
25,378  annotated  images  coming  from  24  pest  species  that  were  all 
collected by an automatic imaging trap. Rustia et al. (2021) designed a 
multi-stage deep learning method including object detection, insect vs. 
non-insect  separation  and  a  multi-class  insect  classification  for  insect 
identification. Data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices 
installed  in  greenhouses  –  under  varying  lighting environments  -  and 
their classification model reached average F1-scores of up to 0.92. Hong 
et  al.  (2021)  developed  an  AI-based  pest  counting  method  for  moni-
toring  the  black  pine  bast  scale  (M.  thungergianae)  which  reached  a

detection  and  classification  accuracy  in  the  popular  object  detection 
benchmarking dataset, known as COCO (Lin et al., 2015), on which it 
was originally trained. In this version of the model, a Cross Stage Partial 
Network (CSPNet) (Wang et al., 2020a) with a Spatial Pyramid Pooling 
(SPP)  layer  is  used  as  the  model  back-bone  and  a  path  aggregation 
network (PANet) as neck to boost information flow. The head in YOLOv5 
achieves multi scale prediction by generating different output feature 
maps.

Helpful Answer:
Two datasets have been mentioned in the given context. One is the "Pest24" dataset, consisting of 25,378 annotated images collected by an automatic imaging trap. This dataset includes images from 24 pest species. Another dataset is not explicitly named but referred to as data acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting environments. These datasets are used for tasks such as object detection, insect vs non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification. However, no widely recognized benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are directly mentioned in the provided context.
