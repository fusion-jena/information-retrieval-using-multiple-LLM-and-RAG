Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For 
instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea 
conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across 
different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the 
spatial resolution of the images through rendering69. In addition, as it is a fast and scalable method, it can even be 
transferred to very high spatial resolution images (<10 cm) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the 
automatic identification of specific individuals70.

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any explicit information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, based solely on this context, it cannot be determined whether the model was deployed on platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
