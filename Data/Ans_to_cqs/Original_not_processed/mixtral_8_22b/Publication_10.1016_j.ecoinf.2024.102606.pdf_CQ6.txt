Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

2.4. Training protocols

The models were all trained with the same parameters: 500 epochs, 
an initial learning rate of 0.01 with a weight decay of 0.005, the opti-
mizer Adam was chosen, with a beta1 of 0.937, and data augmentation 
transformations  were  applied  while  training.  Data  augmentation  is  a 
technique used in machine learning to artificially increase the size of a 
dataset  by  creating  new  samples  from  the  existing  ones.  Augmented 
samples are used to train the model more effectively by increasing its 
ability to generalize and its accuracy on the test dataset. The advantage 
of this technique when dealing with a low amount of data such as in our 
case, is the reduced risk of overfitting, since models are exposed to more 
variations, they will tend  to less memorize the dataset. This  becomes 
essential when you have limited data to train models with, which is a 
common problem in deep-learning applications. Another advantage is

models more reliable on a wider range of input data, which in our case 
would make it more reliable on images from old microscope slices which 
tend to be in a bad state. Finally, it also saves time by reducing the need 
to collect a bigger dataset. Various transformations can be applied to 
create new samples. In the case of images, simple modifications can be 
applied such as flipping or rotating, and more complex ones like color 
distortion or random crop. Here are the data augmentation techniques 
used in training: Random crop, Mosaic, and Color distortions such as 
brightness,  contrast,  saturation,  hue,  Gaussian  blur,  Random  scaling, 
Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. Data augmentation 
helps recreate the state of old microscope slides on new ones (Fig. 3), 
which improves results on old projects. 

2.5. Model bias

relevant regions within the images. ROI pooling aids in the selection and 
analysis  of  specific  image  regions  for  accurate  object  classification.  2 
different  versions  of  Faster  R-CNN  were  created  for  the  benchmark, 
Faster R-CNN (640) with an input dimension of 640 × 640 and Faster R- 
CNN (1280) with an input dimension of 1280 × 1280. They both used 
Resnet50 as a backbone, have 41 m parameters, and are pre-trained on 
ImageNet.  Both  those  dimensions  were  chosen  to  match  the  Yolov5 
input dimensions. Still, after multiple tests, the 640-version had incon-
clusive results. This can be explained by the important features being too 
small using this resolution for Faster R-CNN. Only the 1280 version was 
used in the benchmark.

Helpful Answer:
Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. However, based on the given context, one significant preprocessing step mentioned is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating new samples from existing ones. It helps improve the model's ability to generalize and increases its accuracy on the test dataset. In the context of images, various transformations can be applied to create new samples, including but not limited to: Random crop, Mosaic, Color distortions (like brightness, contrast, saturation, hue), Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. These techniques help recreate the state of old microscope slides on new ones, improving results on old projects. While other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning aren't explicitly mentioned in the context, these are often necessary steps in preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization scales numeric columns to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information, while scaling adjusts the magnitude of the feature to avoid dominance of one feature over others. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points.
