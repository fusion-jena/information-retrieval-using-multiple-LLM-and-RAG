To evaluate the datasets using F-UJI, the datasets were divided into 
the  top  eight  repositories  based  on  the  number  of  datasets  deposited 
(Fig.  2).  The number  of  datasets deposited in  these  eight  repositories 
accounted  for  94.9%  of  the  total  number  of  datasets,  which  was 
considered sufficiently representative. Of these eight repositories, four 
were general repositories, i.e., Figshare (https://figshare.com/), Zenodo 
(https://zenodo.org/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), and CSIRO 
(https://data.csiro.au/),  and  four  were  thematic  repositories,  i.e.,  Ag 
Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov/), KNB Data Repository (htt 
ps://knb.ecoinformatics.org/),  ZALF  Open  Research  Data  (https:// 
open-research-data.zalf.de/default.aspx),  and  Agricultural  and  Envi-
ronmental  Data Archive (AEDA) (http://www.environmentdata.org/). 
The content distributions of the top eight repositories by content type 
are presented in Table 3.

* Dataset: A single or coherent set of data (or a data file) provided by the 
repository as part of a collection, data study, or experiment. These can be of 
multiple file formats such as spreadsheet, video, and audio. Datasets may have 
cited references or can be citable, but more commonly they inherit metadata of 
the overall study. 

** Data study: A description of studies or experiments held in repositories 
with the associated data used in the data study. These are linked to a repository 
and may optionally link to a dataset relating to the more granular data files. 
Data studies can be a citable object in the literature and may have cited ref-
erences attached in their metadata together with information on such aspects 
as  the  principal  investigators,  funding  information,  subject  terms  and 
geographic coverage.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query as it is not directly addressed in the given context. However, I can tell you that common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique has its own use case depending on the specific task and requirements of the project. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is useful for identifying different classes within an image. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects and classify each pixel within those objects. Polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects, while key point annotation focuses on marking specific points on an object. Landmark annotation is similar to key point annotation but is typically used for facial recognition tasks.
