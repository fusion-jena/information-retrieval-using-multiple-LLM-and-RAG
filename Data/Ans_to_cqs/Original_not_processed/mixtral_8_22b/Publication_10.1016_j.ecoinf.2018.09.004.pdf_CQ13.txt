By determining which variables are most important we can simplify
the analysis of a dataset, better understand the physical concepts of it,
and exclude the ones that confuse the model achieving better accuracy
and learning/testing speed.

There exist several ways to determine variable importance, e.g.
Decision Trees, Random Forests, Chi-square, and Regression. We deal
with tree-based variable importance, like (Arthur et al., 2010) did. It

3.2. Machine learning algorithms

There exist many supervised machine learning algorithms in lit-
erature, distinguished into several categories, such as Generalized
Linear Models (GLM), Decision Trees (DT), Instance Based (IB), Support

One of the most popular machine learning methods for classiﬁcation
of linear problems are Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Cherkassky,
1997) with a linear kernel. They try to ﬁnd a set of hyperplanes that

separate the space into areas representing classes. These hyperplanes
are chosen in a way which maximizes the distance from the nearest data
point of each class. The Linear SVC is the simplest and fastest SVM
algorithm assuming a linear separation between classes.

3.2.5. K-nearest neighbors

3.2.5. K-nearest neighbors

It is an non-parametric ‘lazy’ learning algorithm. This means that it
does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and
that it does not use the training data points to do any generalization. It
does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply
stores instances of the training data. Classiﬁcation is computed from a
simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query
point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives
within the nearest neighbors of the point.

3.2.6. Decision tree

The Decision Tree Classiﬁer is a simple and widely used classiﬁca-
tion technique. It applies a straightforward idea to solve the classiﬁ-
cation problem by posing a series of carefully crafted questions about
the attributes of the test record. Each time it receives an answer, a
follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the class label of
the record is reached.

environmental drivers, expressed as water temperature, salinity, nu-
trients,
transparency; ecosystem components, as bathymetry and
bottom substrate; and the human inﬂuence, described by the distance to
cities, ports and river outﬂows have not been previously reported. In
this work we attempt to explore the nonlinear dynamics among the
environment-ecosystem-human gradient and their impact on seagrass
presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. To achieve this, we
utilized the power of machine learning algorithms when applied to
large and diverse datasets maintained by international organizations, as
Copernicus, EMODnet and UNEP. The importance of such work, and
others of similar context could be vital, as there is a real need for un-
derstanding better coastal benthic processes and human interaction,
especially for the Mediterranean Sea, where seagrass loss correlates
with the rapid shoreline urbanization and remedial and restoration

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, I cannot provide specific information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, I can explain some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models.

Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before starting the learning process. Some examples include:

1. Learning Rate: Determines how much the weights should be updated during backpropagation. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge faster but might overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate may take longer to converge but provides more stability.

2. Optimizer: An optimization algorithm used to update the weights of the network. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad. Each optimizer has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the nature of the problem being solved.

3. Batch Size: Refers to the number of samples processed together before updating the weights. Larger batch sizes require more memory but offer a more stable convergence, while smaller batch sizes allow for quicker updates and can help escape local minima.

4. Number of Layers and Neurons: Defining the architecture of the neural network involves deciding the number of hidden layers and neurons within those layers. More complex architectures may improve performance but also increase computational requirements and risk overfitting.

5. Activation Function: Used to introduce non-linearity into the output of a layer. Examples include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, and softmax functions. Different activation functions serve different purposes and can affect the overall performance of the model.

Without additional context, I am unable to specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the query.
