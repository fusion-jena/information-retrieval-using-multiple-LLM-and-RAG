for the customised architecture (see Convolutional neural networks sec-
tion),  and  the  smallest  one  comprised  3900  images  combining  two 
seconds  window  size  and  90  dpi  for  the  transfer  learning  approach 
(Table 1).

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Data collection

training library sizes (8 k and 12 k) demonstrated higher accuracy for 
the one built using a smaller training dataset. Inference using transfer 
learning  was  nearly  twice  as  long  as  the  custom  CNN  architectures 
(Table 1).
