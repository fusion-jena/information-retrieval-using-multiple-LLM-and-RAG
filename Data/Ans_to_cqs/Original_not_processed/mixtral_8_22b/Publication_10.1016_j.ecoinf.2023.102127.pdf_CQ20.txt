are not enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, espe-
cially  given  the  demanding  nature  of  some  machine  learning  ap-
proaches,  and  computation  time  can  be  a  considerable  limitation  as 
well, such as for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will 
raise warnings and highlighted messages in case the provided informa-
tion is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

et  al.,  2017).  These  models  are  usually  the  most  computationally 
intensive, but also the most elegant as all integration is done through 
dataset specific likelihoods (Fig. 2h). 

2.3. Different engines

EcologicalInformatics76(2023)1021277M. Jung

The  backbone  of  any  SDM  modelling  are  the  algorithm  used  for 
inference which in ibis.iSDM are called “engines”. To this date ibis.iSDM 
supports  a  total  of  7  different  engines  for  inferring  or  projecting  the 
relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. Those can broadly be 
classified into engines  using either regressions and or non-parametric 
machine learning approaches and being frequentist or Bayesian in na-
ture. Engines supported are regularized elastic net regressions through 
the glmnet package as also used by the maxnet package (Friedman et al., 
2010; Phillips et al., 2017), Bayesian regularized “Spike-and-Slab”  re-
gressions with the BoomSpikeSlab package (Scott, 2022), Bayesian ad-
ditive  regression  trees  through  dbarts  (Carlson,  2020;  Dorie,  2022), 
monotonic  gradient  descent boosting via  mboost  (Hofner et  al.,  2011; 
Hothorn et al., 2022), Extreme Gradient Boosting through xgboost (Chen

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the provided context, there is no information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized for training the model.
