Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required 
epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for 
signs of overfitting. If the model focuses excessively on data fitting, it 
may imitate insignificant noise rather than the broad properties of in-
terest, resulting in overfitting.

Image classification 

To assess the efficacy of the various techniques, we compute the top- 
k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of 
the correct match (i.e., an annotation of the same individual represented 
by a query annotation) within a list of proposed matches. Consequently, 
a top-1 rank is an accurate result supplied by the algorithm as the most 
probable match for a candidate annotation. A top-5 rating indicates that 
the correct answer might be any of the top-5 values among the returned 
options, and so on.

converged to its most accurate state, assessing each image only 10–30 
times  (in  machine  learning  terms,  after  10–30  “training  epochs”), 
whereas the typical duration is between 70 and 250 epochs. Subsequent 
training had no effect or decreased the algorithm’s performance on held- 
out test data, indicating that its long-term behavior resembled memo-
rizing  its  training  set  rather  than  learning  a  generalized  matching 
strategy (this is the machine learning definition of “overfitting”).

Helpful Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to tune the number of required epochs and then inspect the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model focuses excessively on data fitting, which may cause it to imitate insignificant noise instead of the broad properties of interest. To prevent overfitting, the models were trained and tested until they converged to their most accurate state, with each image being assessed only 10-30 times (or after 10-30 training epochs). Further training did not improve or even decreased the algorithm's performance on held-out test data, suggesting that the model was memorizing its training set rather than learning a generalized matching strategy.
