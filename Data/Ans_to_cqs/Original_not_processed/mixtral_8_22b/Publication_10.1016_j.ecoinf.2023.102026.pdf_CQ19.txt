%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the study by L. Chiaverini et al. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework based solely on this context.
