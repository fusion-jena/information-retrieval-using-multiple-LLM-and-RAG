Figure 4. Block diagram of DeepLabV3+ [42].

A PC with Windows 10 operating system, a GPU card (RTX2070), and 16GB memory is
used for DeepLabv3+ model training and testing which uses the TensorFlow framework to run.
For training a land cover model using the training datasets, the weights of a pre-trained model
with the exception of the logits are used as the starting point and these weights are ﬁne-tuned with
further training. These initial weights belong to a pre-trained model for the PASCAL VOC 2012
dataset (“deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug_2018_01_04.tar.gz”). This model was based on the Xception-65
backbone [42]. Because the number of land covers in the Vasiliko and Kimisala dataset is diﬀerent from
the number of classes in the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset, the logit weights in the pre-trained model are
excluded. The training parameters used for training a model with DeepLabv3+ in this work can be
seen in Table 1.

including a NIR band in addition to the RGB bands. This is because in order to build a satisfactory
model, not only a lot of training data are needed that include the NIR band in addition to RGB color
images but also signiﬁcant GPU power that can conduct a proper training with batch sizes larger than 16.
This is because, for eﬃcient model training, larger batch sizes are recommended in DeepLabV3+ [49].
Moreover, the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is originally designed for three input channels, RGB,
needs to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate four-channel input images. With four-channel input
images, the existing pre-trained models, which are for RGB, cannot be used directly and there is a need
for training a model from scratch or at least modifying the DeepLabV3+ architecture such that only the
weights for the newly added image bands can be learned and the weights of RGB input channels can
be initialized by pre-trained model weights via transfer learning [41].
