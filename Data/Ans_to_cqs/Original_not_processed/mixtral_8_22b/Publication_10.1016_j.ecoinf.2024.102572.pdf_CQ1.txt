resulting  in  detailed  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the 
Panhandle  area  in  Florida,  USA.  This  has  offered  crucial  support  for 
diverse land management and conservation efforts. Bar et al. (Bar and 
Paridha,  2019)  demonstrate  the  incorporation  of  high-resolution 
Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. Machine learning tech-

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The research center utilizes the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they use this API to retrieve picture data related to forest fire points within their study area. Once collected, this data is saved in CSV format on Google Drive for future analysis. Additionally, the researchers also incorporate high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images into their workflow, which are processed using machine learning techniques to identify fire-damaged areas. These methods allow them to gather comprehensive aboveground biomass data, which is then used to inform various land management and conservation efforts.
