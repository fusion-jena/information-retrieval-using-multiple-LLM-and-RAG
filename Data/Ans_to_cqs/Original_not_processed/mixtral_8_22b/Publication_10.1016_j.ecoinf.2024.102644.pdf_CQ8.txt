The repository contains all data (including ESRI-GRID raster files), 
tables, images, animations, and data-manipulation scripts. It is organ-
ised as a step-by-step process in subsequent folders. It also includes the 
list  of  species  used  to  estimate  species  richness  (https://zenodo. 
org/record/8380273/files/All_species_modelled.txt)  and 
the complete set of observation records. 

All data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Crit-
ical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e- 
Infrastructure  (Assante  et  al.,  2019;  Assante  et  al.,  2022;  Coro  et  al., 
2015c; Coro et al., 2017) (https://services.d4science.org/). 
Free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment 
are required.

%Query
Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is stated that all data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. This suggests that the code repository might be hosted on this virtual research environment rather than traditional platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To access the repository, free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment is required. The link provided is <https://services.d4science.org/>.
