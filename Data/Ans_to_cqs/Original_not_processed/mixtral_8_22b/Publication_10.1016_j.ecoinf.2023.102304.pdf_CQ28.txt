Model Proportion for best fitting. Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR

algorithm  is  employed  to  mask  out  cloud,  shadow,  and  water  bodies 
within  multitemporal  imagery  (Zhu  and  Woodcock,  2014).  The  data 
preparation and LTR implementation are run in the Google Earth Engine 
platform (Gorelick et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2018).

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the data preparation and LTR implementation were run in the Google Earth Engine platform. This suggests that the authors may have used this platform for their work, but it doesn't explicitly state that they deployed a deep learning model there. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
