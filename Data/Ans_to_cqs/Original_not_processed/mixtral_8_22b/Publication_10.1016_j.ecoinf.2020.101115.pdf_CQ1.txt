the procedures involved in storing, uploading metadata, and imaging
samples, a high-level process flow was developed (Fig. 3). The process
flow outlines where the sample metadata is generated, analysed, and
eventually stored. Furthermore, it documents how the physical samples
and digital data are linked. This cross-disciplinary process flow is novel
because it outlines how the operational part (routine sampling of fish
for government mandated stock assessment) of an organization (the
MI), and the research capacity of an organization (imaging and reading
growth on scales and otoliths), can be interlinked. Additionally, the
management of the IFBA dataset follows the procedures and roles
outlined within the MI's Data Management Quality Framework

critical information for digital storage: fish sampling location, date,
species, and life stage. The CM database design is centred on each
physical sample, Fig. 2. The metadata, such as fish length, weight, and
day collected, is typically written on the sample envelopes. Some en-
velopes and glass slides contained no metadata, or were labelled with
only a lab number and species. Furthermore, older labels were often
either illegible or damaged. Therefore, samples that contained the ne-
cessary critical information were prioritized to be catalogued first in the
database and repository. The internal vocabulary (and shorthand) used
during sample labelling within the MI field station changed through
time, and between researchers. Furthermore, the local vocabularies
used were often not in accordance with best practice (Hedden, 2010).
The usage of controlled vocabularies, which is a pre-defined list of
terms, enables consistent and accurate information labelling (Mao

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do have some insights into the type of data being handled. The text mentions a fish scale and otolith collection consisting of thousands of samples dating back to 1928. It also discusses the importance of certain metadata like fish sampling location, date, species, and life stage. From this, we can infer that the raw data might include images or scans of these fish scales and otoliths, along with their associated metadata. As for the method of collection, it could involve manual extraction and preservation of these biological structures from various fish species over time. But without explicit mention of survey methods, sensor use, or public datasets, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding those aspects.
