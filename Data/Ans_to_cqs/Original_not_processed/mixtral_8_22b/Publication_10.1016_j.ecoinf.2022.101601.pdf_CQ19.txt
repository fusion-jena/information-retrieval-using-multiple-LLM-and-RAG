identification of missing or unneeded linkages, and act as an alternative 
evaluation  method  for  determining  which  variables  in  the  model  are 
most influential; conditional probabilities can also be learned from al-
gorithms,  such  as  the  Lauritzen  –  Spiegelhalter  algorithm  or  Gibbs 
sampling  (Chen  and  Pollino,  2012).  Finally,  the  inclusion  of  decision 
nodes can limit the tools and algorithms available for use in the GeNIe 
software  program.  The  inclusion  of  decision  nodes  results  in  the  BN 
being classified as an “influence diagram,” and some tools, such as the 
“sensitivity  analysis”  tool,  are  unavailable  for  use  with  influence  dia-
grams within the software. The decision nodes would either need to be 
removed or converted to chance nodes prior to running these tools in 
GeNIe.

%Query
Query: "Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to develop them.
