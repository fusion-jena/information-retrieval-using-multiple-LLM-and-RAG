CNN performance metrics. MSE is the mean square error, MAPE is the mean 
average percentage error, and Acc% is the average accuracy. In addition, the 
number of images in the dataset (set size) for each task and the weighting of 
classes are given. The × indicates that the performance metric is not applicable 
to the specific CNN.

relatively small number of training examples in infrequent age classes 
can lead to lower accuracy when compared with the more abundant age

Helpful Answer:
The table provides information on the performance metrics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), including Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and Accuracy (%). However, it does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Nevertheless, based on common practices in machine learning, one possible criterion could be the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training will terminate early. This means that if the validation error does not improve after a certain number of epochs, the training process may stop to prevent overfitting or wasting computational resources. Unfortunately, this piece of context does not specify the exact number of epochs used in this case. Therefore, while we can infer that such a criterion might have been used, we cannot definitively state what it was.
