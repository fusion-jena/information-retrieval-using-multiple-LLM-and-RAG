increase in accuracy compared to the ResNet and ViT. By incorporating 
CAM, the network gains the capability to attend to important regions, 
thus improving classification accuracy.

The experimental results presented in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate 
the enhancement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating 
CAM into the residual network. Regardless of “medium”  or “small”  or 
the entire dataset, the best classification results are achieved using the 
CA-Hybrid  network.  Notably,  the  experimental  results  demonstrate  a 
positive correlation between image size and classification performance. 
Specifically, larger image tend to yield better classification outcomes.

Helpful Answer:
After model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the most relevant features used by the model for making predictions. They help identify which parts of the input data were most influential in determining the output. This information is useful for understanding how the model makes decisions and identifying potential biases.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the model based on various criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and help determine its suitability for deployment.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives produced by the model. This information helps assess the overall effectiveness of the classifier and identify areas where it may need improvement.

In summary, some common postprocessing steps after model training include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices. These techniques aid in interpreting the behavior of the model, measuring its performance, and identifying opportunities for optimization.
