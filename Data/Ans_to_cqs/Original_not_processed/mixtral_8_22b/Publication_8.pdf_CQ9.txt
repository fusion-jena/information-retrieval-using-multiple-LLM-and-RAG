This   rising   number   of   digitised   herbarium   sheets   provides   an   opportunity   to   employ
computer-based   image   processing   techniques,   such   as   deep   learning,   to   automatically
identify species and higher taxa (Carranza-Rojas et al. 2017, Younis et al. 2018, Carranza-
Rojas   et   al.   2018)   or   to   extract   other   useful   information   from   the   images,   such   as   the
presence   of   pathogens   (as   done   for   live   plant   photos   by   Mohanty   et   al.   2016).   Deep
learning is a subset of machine learning methods for learning data representation. Deep
learning   techniques   require   huge   amounts   of   training   data   to   learn   the   features   and
representation of those data for the specified task by fine tuning parameters of hundreds or
thousands of neural networks, arranged in multiple layers. Learning the value of these
parameters can take vast computer and time resources, especially on huge datasets.

Marco   Schmidt  is   botanist   at   Senckenberg   Biodiversity   and   Climate   Research   Center
(SBIK-F)   with   a   focus   on   African   savannahs   and   biodiversity   informatics   (e.g.   online
databases like African Plants - a photo guide and West African vegetation) and is working
at Palmengarten’s scientific service, curating living collections and collection databases.

Abstract

Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it is common practice to provide links to data repositories in research articles when they are used. Since this paper was published in the Biodiversity Data Journal, which encourages open access and sharing of data, it is likely that the authors have made their data publicly available. The most probable platforms for hosting such data would be Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, given their popularity and relevance to biodiversity studies. To find out exactly where the data repository is located, one could contact the corresponding author, Sohaib Younis, via email (sohaibyounis89@gmail.com) or check the supplementary materials section of the article if available.
