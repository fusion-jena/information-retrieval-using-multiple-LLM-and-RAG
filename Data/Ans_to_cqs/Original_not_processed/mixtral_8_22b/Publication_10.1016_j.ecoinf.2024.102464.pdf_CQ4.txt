In  our  study,  we  utilized  data  from  the  third  and  fourth  natural 
environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to 
assess  the  impact  of  urban  development  on  species  distribution.  To 
achieve  this,  we  employed  seven  different  machine  learning  models, 
extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model both 
before and after urban development (Fig. 3). The AUC value, a critical 
measure of model performance, indicated that the Generalized Linear 
Model  (GLM)  and  Random  Forest  (RF)  models  had  the  highest  AUC 
value  of  0.85,  while  the  Classification  and  Regression  Tree  (CART) 
model  had  the  lowest  at  0.79.  On  average,  the  models  demonstrated 
robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84, underscoring 
their overall effectiveness in species distribution modeling. Despite the 
methodological similarities among the models, their distinct character-

Hanski, 1998). Process-based approaches that include species connec-
tivity  should  exploit  nonlinear  movement  through  habitat-specific 
resistance  coefficients  in  landscape  heterogeneity  (Schooley  and 
Branch,  2009;  Vasudev  et  al.,  2021).  This  can  improve  prediction  of 
impacts  on  colonization  and  recolonization  when  landscapes  are  het-
erogeneous and the remaining suitable habitat is small (Hanski et al., 
2000; Howell et al., 2018; Watts and Handley, 2010). Moreover, frag-
mented habitats can maintain genetic diversity, rescue declining pop-
ulations,  and  sustain  population  networks  through  metapopulation 
dynamics (Moilanen and Hanski, 1998).
