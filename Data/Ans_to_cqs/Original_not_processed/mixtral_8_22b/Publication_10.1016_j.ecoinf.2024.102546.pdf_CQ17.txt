jitter and mosaic augmentations, while DINO implements random crop 
and scale augmentation. The original weed images, which were mostly 
with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to the input of 
800  × 800  pixels,  which  is  compatible  with  model  architectures  and 
training efficiency. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of 
each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the 
original image aspect ratio. All models were trained for 40 epochs with 
batch  size  8,  which  could  adequately  converge  based  on  empirical 
observations.

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the I3Net framework uses target domains with regularizations for feature consistency. Regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization can be employed to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons and reducing overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. Other common regularization techniques include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Without more detailed information from the context, we cannot definitively state which regularization methods were used in this particular case.
