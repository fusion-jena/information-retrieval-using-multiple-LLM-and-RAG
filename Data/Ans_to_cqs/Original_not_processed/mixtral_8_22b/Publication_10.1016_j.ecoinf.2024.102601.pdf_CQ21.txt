exclusively use the dNBR model in this study to create a comprehensive 
training dataset through a systematic three-step process.

For the hyperparameter optimization task, we employ two predom-
inant models— RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV—provided by 
the  scikit-learn  library  to  meticulously  refine  the  RF  algorithm’s  per-
formance.  The  tuning  methodology  encompasses  an  initial  broad 
exploration of the hyperparameter space using RandomizedSearchCV, 
followed by a focused and exhaustive search using GridSearchCV to fine- 
tune the model. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search 
over  the  predefined  hyperparameter  space,  offering  a  computational 
advantage  by  evaluating  a  user-specified  subset  of  hyperparameter 
combinations.  This  method  aids  in  efficiently  navigating  vast  hyper-
parameter  spaces  and  is  particularly  advantageous  when  there  is  un-
certainty  regarding  the  optimal  values.  It  generates  a  sample  of  the 
parameter settings based on specified distributions, allowing the incor-

identification of the most salient predictor, revealing the variables that 
significantly  influence  the  model’s  inferential  capacity  in  assessing 
WSM. At the heart of SHAP is the Shapley values, which are calculated as 
follows: For each feature of features, we compare the prediction with 
and without the feature of interest, averaging over all possible subsets. 
For a prediction model f, the SHAP value for feature i in a particular 
instance x is calculated as: 

Φi(f, x) =

∑

|S|!(|F| (cid:0)

|S|(cid:0) 1)!

S⊆F\{i}

|F|!

[fx(S ∪ {i} ) (cid:0)

fx(S) ]

where Φi  is the SHAP value for feature i, F is the set of all features, S is a 
subset of features excluding i, fx(S) is the prediction of the model f when 
only the features in set S are utilized. The term 
is a weighting

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV methods from the scikit-learn library. These techniques help improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Additionally, the text mentions the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP calculates the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, helping identify the most important features or predictors. While these details do not directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, they suggest potential avenues for further analysis and evaluation of the trained model.
