The performance of BTS-ANFIS was significantly higher for all
evaluation measurements (Table 4) than the one developed using the
complete dataset (13 MS), attributed to model overtraining when thefull
dataset was used for training. The CA and TSAWQI are efficient tech-
niques to identify tendencies in historical data and select

providing greater variability for predictive model training. This research
has demonstrated that using reduced amounts of data (composed of the
most representative scenarios) for training an ANFIS model significantly
improved prediction performance. Additionally, the data reduction did
not greatly affect ANN and SVM models as only a slight decrease in
evaluation measurements was observed when BTS was used, even
though this subset contained <50% of the full dataset (n = 409 vs n =
894). This finding is remarkable since the general approach in machine
learning is that the bigger the dataset used for training, the greater the

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using Cluster Analysis (CA) and Time Series Analysis with Water Quality Index (TSAWQI) techniques. These methods help identify trends in historical data and select those providing greater variability for predictive model training. Specifically, the use of reduced amounts of data composed of the most representative scenarios improved the prediction performance of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model. Furthermore, the data reduction did not significantly impact Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, as only a slight decrease in evaluation measurements was observed when BTS was used, despite containing less than 50% of the full dataset. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training involved selecting the most relevant data subsets for training, which led to improved prediction accuracy without requiring extensive datasets.
