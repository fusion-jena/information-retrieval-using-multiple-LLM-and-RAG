(Zhang and Benveniste, 1992), Bayesian learning machine (Xu, 1997),
and so on. Researchers have extended the application and improve the
algorithms based on classical neural network models afterwards. Since
2006 deep learning started to boom in academia and industry. The deep
learning algorithm broke the limitation of the traditional neural net-
work on the number of layers. According to demands of designers, the
number of network layers was chosen and trained by large-scale data to
obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features which is
beyond imagination before (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

after individual trials from BPNN2-1 (insuﬃcient ﬁtting ability) to
BPNN7-1 (overﬁtting and unstable), BPNN4-1 oﬀers the lowest mean
square error and the most 17 stable average performance at 0.000694,
with a maximum allowable training time of 1000. We choose an
adaptive strategy to modulate the learning rate to improve the neural
network convergence rate. The results show a benchmark learning rate
of 0.01, a learning rate up to 1.07 as the error steadily decreases, a
learning rate down to 0.70 as the error increases, a limit of the training

Because the output error of the neurons in the output layer does not
satisfy the accuracy requirement, the learning process turns into a
backward error propagation process, and the basic model is as follows:

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, where a model learns the noise or outliers in the training data instead of generalizing well to new, unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) that randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a proportion of the units in a layer during training. This prevents complex co-adaptations among the feature detectors in the layer, reducing overfitting. During testing, all units are active but their outputs are scaled down by the same proportion used during training, ensuring consistent predictions.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and more likely to generalize better. It can be implemented by adding a factor multiplied by the sum of squares of the weights to the cost function.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization (also called Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Max Norm Constraints. These methods aim to reduce complexity and increase generalizability, improving the overall performance of deep learning models.
