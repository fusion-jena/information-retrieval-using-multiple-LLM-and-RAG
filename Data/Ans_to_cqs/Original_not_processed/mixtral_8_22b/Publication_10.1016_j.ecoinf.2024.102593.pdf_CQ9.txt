accuracy  limits  that  we  encountered  training  DNN  models  with  the 
detailed-labelled NIPS4Bplus dataset (Bravo Sanchez et al., 2021). We 
drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET) 
and  compared  it  to  our  SincNet  trained  models.  For  that,  we  experi-
mented  with  dimensionality  reduction  of  embeddings  and  an  initial 
dimensionality reduction technique (t-SNE). We generated embeddings 
using  the  BirdNET  model  on  a  randomly  selected  40%  sample  of  the

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in research publications, one can look for links or references to datasets within the cited papers or their supplementary materials. Unfortunately, none of the mentioned sources directly indicate a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, without additional context or further investigation into the referenced works, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for this particular deep learning pipeline.
