observed data (e.g. Bhattacharya, 1967), thus reducing manual labour to 
a minimum.

priors through the R-code (supplement S1). The outcome is presented in 
a figure, but is also stored as a .csv file when running the R-code, hence, 
the number of errors at each frequency can be studied in detail.

include all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding observations, an approach which can affect 
the reliability of studies. This study also, to a great extent, explains the poor performance of software attempting 
automated bat ID. Implementing Bayesian algorithms, and thereby allowing users to interact with the software, 
should significantly improve their performance.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions the use of Bayesian algorithms for improving the performance of automated bat identification software. In machine learning, including Bayesian methods, common criteria to determine when training is complete include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, improvement in accuracy, or reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs or iterations. Without further details, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used in this particular case.
