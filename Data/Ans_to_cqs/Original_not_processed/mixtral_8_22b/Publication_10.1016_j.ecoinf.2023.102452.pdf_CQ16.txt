specified number of iterations. For this study, the Eureka Pro software is 
utilized for GP modeling. This software was developed by Cornell Uni-
versity’s Data Science Order and was released in 2009 (Eureqa, 2009). It 
is crucial to emphasize that GP serves multiple roles in this paper. Once 
GP is employed as the forecasting model, we extract the inputs utilized 
in  the  optimal  GP  tree  and  utilize  them  as  the  optimal  inputs  for 
modeling  with  ANN.  The  primary  reason  for  selecting  GP  as  our  IVS 
technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and 
perform modeling tasks (Althoey et al., 2023; Hu, 2023).

previous  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  FIPSO  as  a 
trainer for ANN models (Ang et al., 2022; Bas et al., 2022). In this study, 
a standard data split was employed, where 70% of the available data was 
used for model training, and the remaining 30% was dedicated to testing 
and evaluating the results. Fig. 7 provides a visual representation of the

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a specified number of iterations to determine when training is complete. However, there is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria to decide when training should be stopped. Instead, the focus seems to be on utilizing the Eureka Pro software for Genetic Programming (GP) modeling, which was developed by Cornell University's Data Science Order and released in 2009. The software is chosen due to its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and perform modeling tasks. Furthermore, the study employs a standard data split, where 70% of the available data is used for model training, and the remaining 30% is dedicated to testing and evaluating the results.
