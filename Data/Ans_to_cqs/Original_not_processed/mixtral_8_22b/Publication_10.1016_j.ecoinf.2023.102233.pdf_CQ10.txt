Active  learning  iterations  used  a  batch  size  of  64,  ten  epochs  and 
learning rate of 0.001. We used a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 
2018) to tune hyperparameters of the final model including the number 
of epochs, batch size and learning rate. 

2.3.3. Active learning framework 

We  applied  an  active  learning  approach  to  iteratively  train  and 
improve  the  CNN  model.  The  active  learning  approach  is  depicted 
within Fig. 3 and described below.

We provide an open access solution to address these challenges using two strategies. First, we applied an active 
learning framework to iteratively improve a convolutional neural network (CNN) model able to automate call 
identification  for  a  target  rare  bird  species,  the  southern  black-throated  finch  (Poephila  cincta  cincta).  We 
collected 9098 h of unlabelled audio recordings from a field study in the Desert Uplands Bioregion of Queens-
land,  Australia,  and  used  active  learning  to  prioritise  human  annotation  effort  towards  data  that  would  best 
improve model fit. Second, we progressed methods for managing ambiguous vocalisations by applying machine 
learning methods more commonly used in medical image analysis and natural language processing. Specifically, 
we assessed agreement among human annotators and the CNN model (i.e. inter-annotator agreement) and used
