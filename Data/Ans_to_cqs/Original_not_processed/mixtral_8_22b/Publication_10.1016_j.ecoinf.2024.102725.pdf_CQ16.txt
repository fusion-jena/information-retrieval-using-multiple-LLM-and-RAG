The study used MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06,
spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data were ob-
tained from the Google Earth Engine platform and subjected to pre-
processing steps including mosaicking and clipping. The data access link

3.4. Accuracy evaluation metrics

This study utilizes a consistent color ramp and stretch function to
render all of the NDVI images. Four evaluation metrics, the coefficient of
determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS), are employed
to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual
images.

R2 reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the refer-
ence images, with values ranging from -∞ to 1. An R2 value of 1 in-
dicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while
R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of
the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation. The calcu-
lation formula is as follows:

R2 = 1 (cid:0)

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other stopping conditions. However, we can infer that the study uses various evaluation metrics like the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) to compare the differences between the predicted and actual images. These metrics help evaluate the performance of the models during training and could potentially be used to decide when to stop training based on their improvement over time. Nonetheless, without explicit details about the training process, it remains uncertain which exact criteria are applied to conclude the completion of training.
