As Fig. 3 shows, the data are first divided into five equal folds in the 
proposed  FAA-based approach.  After that,  policies will  augment each 
fold without repetition. Then, the CNN model starts to process the folds. 
In  the  next  step,  the  optimal  augment  policies  are  evaluated  and 
recognized. The output of each CNN is controlled by a Bayesian opti-
mizer. Weak policies are then removed by the controller and strong ones 
are selected. The process continues to find the optimal policies for data 
augmentation. 

2.3. The proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) 

CNN-based methods have better performance in identifying plants, 
but still, based on data analysis and some previous research (Wang et al., 
2020, Azadnia et al., 2023), texture characteristics are very important. 
Therefore, more attention should be paid to the modules that consider

attention mechanisms enhance efficiency of deep learning (DL) networks by allowing them to precisely focus on 
all relevant input elements. In order to enhance the performance of the proposed model, the CA was implemented 
based on four pooling operations including global average pooling-based CA (GAP-CA), mixed pooling-based CA 
(Mixed-CA), gated pooling-based CA (Gated-CA), and tree pooling-based CA (Tree-CA) operations. The results 
showed that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art 
models, achieving the values of 99.63%, 99.38%, 99.52%, 99.74%, and 99.42%, for accuracy, precision, recall, 
specificity, and F1-score, respectively. The findings support our proposed attention model's success in identifying 
medicinal  plants  from  similar  poisonous  plants.  Recent  advancements  in  computer-based  technologies  and

Therefore, it is important to take into account several features and 
place  emphasis  on  the  features  that  are  efficient  for  different  herbs. 
Performance  of  deep  neural  networks  will  be  enhanced  when  the 
attention  mechanism  enables  them  to  precisely  focus  on  all  relevant 
input elements. This method has become a popular technique in DL for 
text classification, image interpretation, and sentiment analysis (Wani 
et al., 2020). Models like attention mechanisms have high accuracy, and 
most of these mechanisms can be jointly trained with a basic model, such 
as a recurrent neural network or a convolutional neural network (CNN), 
using  a  regular  back-propagation  algorithm.  In  DL  models,  feature 
extraction  takes  place  hierarchically  through  CNNs  from  a  global 
perspective. At the same time, the attention mechanism focuses on the 
significant information of an image, improving the performance of CNN

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer that the proposed approach employs certain strategies to address variability and improve the overall performance of the deep learning model.

Firstly, the data is divided into five equal folds, which could help reduce the impact of any inherent biases or noise present in the dataset. By processing each fold separately, the model can learn from diverse subsets of the data, potentially leading to improved generalization capabilities.

Secondly, the use of a Bayesian optimizer suggests that the model incorporates probabilistic reasoning to manage uncertainty and randomness. Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions that doesn't require derivatives. It works by constructing a posterior distribution of functions (Gaussian Process) that best describes the function you want to optimize. This allows the model to make informed decisions regarding hyperparameter tuning and policy selection, even in the presence of randomness.

Lastly, the implementation of attention mechanisms further enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant input elements, thereby reducing the influence of irrelevant or noisy features. Attention mechanisms enable the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data, effectively mitigating the effects of randomness and improving overall performance.
