Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the input data with relevant metadata or tags, which can then be used by machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset. For example, object detection tasks often use bounding boxes to identify objects within images, while image segmentation tasks may require pixel-level labels to distinguish between different regions of an image. Without more specific details from the given context, it is difficult to determine which data annotation techniques were used in this particular case.
