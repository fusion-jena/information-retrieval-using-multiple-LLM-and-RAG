The network takes images with dimensions of 256 × 256 pixels and 
three  color  channels  as  input.  It  follows  a  fully  convolutional  design, 
with  each  layer  applying  2D  convolutions  using  4  × 4  filters.  Batch 
Normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation functions are used after each 
convolution  layer  to  facilitate  network  training  and  stability.  The 
encoder consists of 5 blocks, which progressively reduce the spatial di-
mensions and learn features. It starts with a convolutional layer with 32 
output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. The re-
sidual block comprises a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure, where a convolu-
tional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and 
another convolutional layer. This configuration is designed to effectively 
capture  and  enhance  image  features,  serving  as  a  critical  component 
within the network's architecture. The residual block output is then fed

structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging 
the network to learn complex representations. To enhance the network's 
capacity  for  capturing  fine-grained  features  and  context,  Spatial  and 
Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture. 
These modules act as mechanisms for focusing on relevant spatial re-
gions  and  channel-wise  information,  respectively.  These  attention 
mechanisms are integrated at multiple stages in the network to enrich 
the feature representations. The decoder upscales the feature maps and 
fuses  information  from  the  encoder  using  skip  connections.  Each 
decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase 
spatial  resolution,  followed  by  batch  normalization  and  ReLU  activa-
tion.  The  final  stage  of  the  network  involves  upsampling  the  feature 
maps, followed by a convolutional layer with 4 × 4 filters to produce the

In this work, we used a linear combination of the adversarial loss 

function Ladv, L1  loss function, and the perceptual loss function Lper.

where λ1  and λ2  are scaling factors set to 7 and 3, respectively. 

Adversarial Loss: We used adversarial loss to facilitate the training 
of the generator network and the discriminator network in a competitive 
manner. This loss function encourages the generator to minimize the log 
probability  that  the  discriminator  assigns  to  the  generated  samples,

spatial details. A detailed enhancement block and a supervised recovery 
block  were  also  incorporated  between  these  subnetworks  to  enhance 
color accuracy further and refine fine details in the image restoration

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning prior to training the deep learning model. However, some aspects of data preparation can be inferred from the description of the network architecture and its components.

For instance, the network accepts images with dimensions of 256 x 256 pixels and three color channels as input. This implies that the images have been resized and possibly converted to a standard format (RGB). Additionally, the use of Batch Normalization after each convolution layer suggests that the input data has undergone some form of normalization during the training process.

Furthermore, the presence of Leaky-ReLU activation functions indicates that the network handles negative values appropriately, implying that no additional processing might be required to address potential issues related to negative pixel intensities.

However, without more specific information about the dataset and any preprocessing steps applied to it, one cannot definitively state what exact preprocessing techniques were employed before training the deep learning model.
