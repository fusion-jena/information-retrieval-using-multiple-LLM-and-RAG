3.3. Noise tolerance 

Large  neural  networks  can  handle  minor  variations  in  the  input 
caused by different compression schemes (Sainath et al., 2015). Thus, 
changing  the  range  and  scale  of  the  inputs  is  unlikely  to  make  a 
noticeable difference. Yet, it is readily evident in Table 2 that combining 
the compression with normalization is significantly better regardless of 
the frontend, whether through PCEN or conventional methods. 

Lostanlen  et  al.  (2018)  showed  that  PCEN  whitens  the  data  by 
Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. 
Thus, it alleviates stationary background noise. The following analyses 
confirm  this  result  for  species  recognition  from  outdoor  recordings. 
Furthermore,  it  shows  that  other  combinations  of  compression  and 
normalization will also suppress noise.

This  experiment  used  both  learnable  frontends  with  80  filters  of 
length  512  (16 ms)  that were  initialized  by  mel-filterbanks.  Gaussian 
pooling  was  removed,  and  downsampling  happened  in  the  filtering 
convolution layer by a stride of 320 (10 ms). Then, the outputs were log- 
compressed  without  normalization.  These  plain  frontends  are  called 
LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and Table 4 shows their test results.

3.1. Main results 

Table 2 shows the test results. The largest performance gap between 
the learnable and traditional frontends stems from using PCEN instead 
of log compression. When combined with PCEN, the (mel-)spectrogram 
is on par with the learnable frontends. Noticeably, a proper normaliza-
tion on top of the log compression produced similar results to the PCEN 
version of the models. It is hard to eyeball some of these effects, espe-
cially for the data augmentation. Therefore, a performance summary for 
the 48 models is depicted in Fig. 3 to comprehend the importance of 
each component. Fig. 4 shows the confusion matrices of the base and the 
best configuration for each frontend.

Efficacy  of  normalization:  The  remarkable  improvement  of  the 
(mel-)spectrogram and learnable frontends from a simple normalization 
was  partly  unexpected  since  input  normalization  usually  results  in 
different  parameter  values  but  similar  performance.  We  remind  the 
readers  that  the  normalization  was  applied  on  the  backend’s  input, 
which  is  the  frontend’s  output.  Maybe  a  comparable  accuracy  is 
attainable  without  normalization  but  requires  an  optimal  training 
regime,  extensive  hyper-parameter  tuning,  and  potentially  modifying 
the backend classifier. Therefore, input normalization at least made the 
learning  much  easier  since  all  models  used  the  same  backend  and 
optimization  setting. Another  reason  for performance  gain  is that the 
PCEN and normalization schemes strengthened the models against un-
seen  natural  and  urban  noise  (section  3.3).  It  is  a  desirable  property

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there are mentions of techniques that could be considered forms of regularization or help improve model robustness.

One technique mentioned is the use of large neural networks, which can handle minor variations in input caused by different compression schemes. This suggests that larger networks may have inherent regularization properties due to their capacity to generalize well even when faced with varying input conditions.

Additionally, the text discusses the application of Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), which whitens the data by Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. This process helps alleviate stationary background noise and improves the model's ability to recognize species from outdoor recordings. Although not explicitly stated, applying PCEN can be seen as a form of feature normalization, which contributes to improving model performance and preventing overfitting.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of input normalization applied to the backend's input, which is the frontend's output. Input normalization ensures that features have consistent scales across different examples, making the learning process more efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting.

In conclusion, while the given context does not directly address the query regarding specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, it highlights the use of large neural networks, Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), and input normalization as techniques that contribute to improved model performance and reduced overfitting.
