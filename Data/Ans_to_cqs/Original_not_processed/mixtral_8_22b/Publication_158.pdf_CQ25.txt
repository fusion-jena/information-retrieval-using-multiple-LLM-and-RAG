There are numerous aspects to consider for enhancing the deep-learning classiﬁer,
speciﬁcally regarding the input image size; network conﬁguration, depth, and width; and
training strategy. In initial experimentation, several standard forms of deep-learning CNN
architectures were tested based largely on ResNet [46] and Inception [63], but these did
not perform well due to the range of image objects size/scales encountered. To account
for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the
32 by 32 pixel input image, the ensemble with varying input image sizes was selected.
Segmentation-based approaches were also considered as an alternative, but sufﬁcient
quality training data for segmentation was a limitation.

large grey square. Numbers represent the number of features output from a convolution or dense
layer, except for the cropping layers where the crop dimension is shown.

2.5. Classiﬁcation and Assessment

In addition to the deep-learning classiﬁer, we also tested random forest that included
spatial features for comparison. Random forest is an efﬁcient algorithm that can be easily
applied in a distributed processing framework. Thus, if sufﬁcient accuracy could be
achieved then it would be the preferred classiﬁer. For assessment, we evaluated the
classiﬁcation results against the test sample and report error matrices, summary accuracy
measures, and class accuracies. Summary measures included the overall accuracy, kappa,
and average F1-score. For class accuracies we report the F1-score, which provides class-
speciﬁc accuracy, accounting for both omission and commission error.

2.5.1. Ensemble CNN

For training, the Adam optimizer was used with 500 epochs and categorical-cross
entropy loss function. Batch size was set to 64. Data augmentation was applied to enhance
sample variation and included rotation, reﬂectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of
±10% reﬂectance for 15% of the input image. To determine training convergence, we
monitored the validation data across training epochs and the network weights with the
best performance were kept. Early stopping criteria was applied if no improvement was
found in 50 epochs. For CNNs, weight initialization and random selection for batch
training can lead to variability in the results. Thus, an ensemble of three models were
generated and the average of the ﬁnal output layer taken. Max pooling was used for two
models in the ensemble and average pooling for one. In initial tests using max or average
pooling showed that both provided improvement in some cases and thus could enhance

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification tasks. This is evident from the mention of a deep-learning classifier being employed alongside other methods such as random forests. Furthermore, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as depicted in Figure 3, supports this claim since CNNs are commonly utilized for image classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions evaluating the classification results against a test sample and reporting various metrics like error matrices, summary accuracy measures, and class accuracies. These practices are typically associated with assessing the performance of a classification model. While segmentation-based approaches were considered initially, they were not pursued due to insufficient quality training data for segmentation. Therefore, the main objective of the deep learning model in this scenario is to accurately classify images into their respective categories.
