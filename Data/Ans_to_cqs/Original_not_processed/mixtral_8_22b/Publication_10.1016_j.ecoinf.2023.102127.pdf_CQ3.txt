Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for multi-nomial predictions, which implies image-based input data. In general, common data annotation techniques for image-based deep learning include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location and classify them. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike semantic segmentation, which groups pixels into classes without distinguishing between individual instances, instance segmentation identifies each distinct object within an image. This technique provides detailed information about the shape and size of objects, making it suitable for applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging.

3. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding box annotation, polygon annotation involves outlining objects but uses irregular shapes instead of rectangles. This method offers greater precision when dealing with complex or non-rectangular objects.

4. Landmark/Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on objects within images, often used for facial recognition or pose estimation tasks.

5. Semantic Segmentation: As mentioned earlier, semantic segmentation assigns pixel-level labels to entire images, grouping similar elements together. This approach is beneficial for understanding scenes and identifying patterns.

While these techniques are widely used in various deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not explicitly state which ones were employed in this particular study.
