to  the  size  and  number  of  convolution  kernels  and  hyperparameters, 
such  as  the  learning  rate.  Introducing  the  hybrid  model  not  only  en-
hances  the  processing  power  of  the  model  but  also  makes  the  model 
more robust and better able to deal with the complexity of the drought 
propagation time and the relationship between the influencing factors. 
Notably,  after  embedding  LSTM  into  the  CNN,  even  without  any  ad-
justments to the hyperparameters, the model's prediction accuracy on 
the  testing  set  has  already  improved  by  about  20%  compared  to  the 
original CNN.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. Secondly, they used a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year to generate forty-two distinct datasets, each corresponding to a separate period. This strategy allowed them to capture the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation more accurately. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's generalizability.
