Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In this phase the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute 
error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution 
(cid:0) 5. Moreover, we utilize 
of 1536 × 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10
only horizontal flipping for data augmentation in this phase. 

2.5. Baseline comparison 

To also have a comparison of our method with a simpler approach, 
we compare our results with the ones from a ResNet50 that was pre- 
trained  on  the  ImageNet  classification  dataset  (Russakovsky  et  al., 
2015) with added FPN, later also referred to at ImageNet baseline model. 
As the ImageNet dataset is a normal classification dataset that does not 
contain the plant species from our dataset, this network cannot be uti-
lized  for  zero-shot  cover  prediction.  Hence,  we  only  evaluate  this 
network after training it on our dedicated plant cover data.

2.4. Network setup for investigations 

For extracting plant species cover information for our investigations, 
we  use  the  same  setup  as  described  in  K¨orschens  et  al.  (2021b)  with 
slight differences. During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 
2016),  which  is  initialized  with  ImageNet  (Russakovsky  et  al.,  2015) 
weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as 
well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and 
Hutter, 2017). During each phase, we use the ResNet in conjunction with 
a  Feature  Pyramid  Network  (FPN)  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  to  increase  the 
network output resolution. Phase-specific parameters are listed in the

Fig. 4. The basic 3-phase processing pipeline for training our network. In the first phase, a classification network is trained using GBIF image data, which applies 
class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps. In the second phase, these maps are used for training a segmentation network on the GBIF image data. 
In the third phase, the networks weights can be used to either train a plant cover prediction network on the actual vegetation data (like the InsectArmageddon 
dataset), or the network can be applied directly to vegetation data to generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations. Image adapted

Helpful Answer:
The paper uses the AdamW optimizer during all three phases of their investigation. This optimizer is a variant of the popular Adam optimizer, which combines the advantages of both adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and momentum-based methods like Momentum. The AdamW optimizer further improves upon Adam by adding weight decay regularization, which helps prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Additionally, the authors mention using a learning rate of 10^-4 during the first two phases of their study. However, they do not specify whether this learning rate is constant throughout training or if it decays over time. Overall, the choice of optimization technique and hyperparameters can greatly impact the performance of deep learning models, so it is important to carefully consider these factors when designing and implementing such pipelines.
