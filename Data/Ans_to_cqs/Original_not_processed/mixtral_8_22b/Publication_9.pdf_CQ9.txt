Abstract

1.  Digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big data-

sets and typically must be pre- processed prior to conducting analyses. One crucial 

image pre- processing step in any image analysis workflow is image segmentation, 

or the ability to clearly contrast the foreground target from the background noise 

in an image. This procedure is typically done manually, creating a potential bot-

tleneck for efforts to quantify biodiversity from image databases. Image segmen-

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it cites several related works that have published their datasets or tools on platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo, and Figshare. For instance, Van Belleghem et al. (2018) published their R package 'patternize' on GitHub, while Van Horn et al. (2018) made their iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset available on Zenodo. Given these examples, it is possible that the authors may also publish their deep learning pipeline on a similar platform. Nevertheless, without explicit information, we cannot definitively state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
