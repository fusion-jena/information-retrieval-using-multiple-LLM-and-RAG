hyperparameter  automatically.  However,  given  their  capability  to 
assemble 40 models in one simulation, we are leveraging this advantage 
to narrow down the selection of machine learning models. Subsequently, 
based on the suggestions of the Lazy Predict algorithm, ML models were 
further fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques. This process 
led to the development of robust ML models for each SWQP one after 
another. These ML models were optimized for each water quality mea-
sure. XGB, RF, and ET were chosen to build a stacking-based ANN meta 
ML  model  based  on  their  best  performance  and  the  entire  autoML 
model’s results.

3.2.1. Lazy predict algorithm 

Lazy Predict, a popular Python library, automates machine learning 
and offers 40 ML models. This large collection allows rigorous testing to 
find  the  best  forecasting  models  for  our  dataset.  Since  data  diversity

Table  2  lists  nine  grid  search  ML  models  with  fivefold  cross- 
validation for four WQPs and hyperparameters. Model evaluation and 
hyperparameter selection use cross-validation resampling. The dataset is 
split  into  five  equal-sized  folds  using  fivefold  cross-validation.  Five 
times, one of each fold, the training and assessment process is validated. 
A  more  complete  model  performance  analysis  is  possible.  Averaging 
coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE across five iterations with five 
folds  improves  model  performance  and  hyperparameter  tuning  effi-
ciency estimation. The Python library’s randint command picks integers 
within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. We 
use  the  uniform  command  for  discrete  or  continuous  values  inside  a 
range,  like  the  min_samples_split  hyperparameter.  These  commands 
examined  multiple  hyperparameter  value  ranges  to  establish  model

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that XGB, RF, and ET were chosen to build a stacking-based ANN meta ML model. However, these are not types of deep learning models but rather ensemble methods (XGB - eXtreme Gradient Boosting, RF - Random Forest, ET - Extra Trees). Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
