2.1. Study areas

Potapov30m was derived using GEDI, Landsat and SRTM data and a 
regression tree algorithm. It has spatial resolution of 30 m and is valid 
for  the  year  2019.  The  estimate  of  GEDI  canopy  height  used  in  the 
models represents the 95th percentile of energy return height relative to 
the ground (RH95). To select the highest quality training and validation 
data they used for the modelling only observations collected in power 
beam mode, during the night, and with beam sensitivity 0.9. In addition, 
they  excluded  observation  collected  during  the  leaf-off  season  in 
temperate and boreal forests. 

Validation of Potapov30m using ALS data performed by the authors 
themselves showed ME of (cid:0) 3.8 m, RMSE of 9.07 m, and MAE of 6.36 m

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the study uses a regression tree algorithm and provides details about the input data sources such as GEDI, Landsat, and SRTM data. Additionally, it discusses the selection criteria for the training and validation data, including the use of power beam mode, nighttime collection, and exclusion of observations during the leaf-off season in temperate and boreal forests. Furthermore, the context includes information about the validation results of Potapov30m using ALS data, which shows a mean error (ME) of -3.8 m, root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.07 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.36 m. Nevertheless, without further information regarding the modeling process or the evaluation metrics used during training, it is impossible to determine the exact strategy employed to monitor the model performance during this phase.
