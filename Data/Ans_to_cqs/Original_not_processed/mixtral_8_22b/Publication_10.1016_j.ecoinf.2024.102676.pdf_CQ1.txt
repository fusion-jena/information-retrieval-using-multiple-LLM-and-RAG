approach can transform the ability to use data of lower quality. This is of 
particular  value  for  population  estimate  surveys.  Therefore,  our  pro-
posed approach could widen the range of FIT and we encourage future 
development of new species algorithms for which the number of high- 
quality prints in a trail found in situ is usually lower.

We  strongly  believe  that  the  utilization  of  professional  tracking 
combined  with  community  involvement  through  citizen  science  data 
collection  of  footprints  and  state-of-the-art  machine  learning  holds 
immense potential as an additional non-invasive method in the toolbox 
of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. 
This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from 
both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in 
wildlife conservation.

Helpful Answer:
The sources provided do not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss various approaches related to wildlife tracking and pattern recognition, which may involve different types of data collection methods. For instance, Garcia-Laencina et al. (2010) discuss pattern classification with missing data, while Gu et al. (2014) focus on sex determination of Amur tigers from footprints in snow. These studies suggest that image or visual data might be collected for analysis. Additionally, Hasler et al. (2004) describe footprint recognition of rodents and insects, implying the use of physical evidence or images for identification purposes.

Moreover, Schwerter et al. (2024) evaluate tree-based imputation methods for drawing inferences in empirical studies, indicating that their research involves dealing with missing data. This suggests that the authors might have employed existing datasets or generated their own during the course of their study. Similarly, Rubin (2004) focuses on multiple imputations for nonresponse in surveys, suggesting that survey data might also play a role in such analyses.

Lastly, the declaration of competing generative AI in scientific writing mentions the use of ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code. While this does not directly relate to data collection methods, it implies that language processing tools and software development practices are involved in the overall process.

In conclusion, based on the given sources, one can infer that various data collection methods, including surveys, physical evidence, and possibly sensor data, might be utilized in the deep learning pipeline for wildlife tracking and pattern recognition. However, without explicit information regarding the specific methods employed by each source, a definitive list cannot be provided.
