Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

computer vision still lags that of human annotators, particularly when 
images are derived from locations outside of a model’s training domain, 
and  several  authors  have  emphasized  the  need  for  human  review  of 
computer  vision  results  (Fennell  et  al.,  2022;  Schneider  et  al.,  2020; 
V´elez et al., 2023).

shown to reduce the processing time of image classification load by as 
much as 5× to 13× depending on the tasks (Fennell et al., 2022; Henrich

2. Workflow 

The multi-step, semi-automated workflow proposed here (Fig. 1) is 
adapted from B¨ohner et al., 2023, including pre-processing of images, 
model  training,  classification,  manual  quality  checks,  and  final  data 
formatting. Specifically, we build on the results of Rigoudy et al. (2022) 
and  Fennell  et  al.  (2022),  who  combined  MegaDetector  with  manual 
classification and custom-trained models. The workflow consists of the 
following two classification steps in addition to pre-processing of images 
and  final  manual  inspection,  quality  control,  and  data  formatting 
(Fig. 1).

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the process involves both automated computer vision methods and manual human review.

In the context, it mentions the use of MegaDetector which is likely a computer vision tool used for object detection in images. It also refers to manual classification and custom-trained models, suggesting that some level of manual data annotation was involved.

However, without more detailed information about these processes, it cannot be definitively stated what specific data annotation techniques were used. Therefore, based solely on this context, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query.
