the satellite. The labeling part determines the labeling methodology for 
training  the  deep  learning  model.  In  the  classification  part,  a  deep 
learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps. The 
target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classi-
fied using the trained model. Here, the format refers to the spatial res-
olution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order 
of  each  band.  If  satellite  imagery  accumulates  owing  to  continuous 
satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and 
classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land 
monitoring.

the  research conducted  by Kim et  al. (2021a).  Therefore, even in the 
absence of specific classes, using phenological characteristics, elements 
can still be classified on the basis of using classes that are most relevant. 
As  suggested  by  Kim  et  al.  (2021a),  the  classification  accuracy  and 
performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep 
learning  model  using  satellite  imageries  over  multiple  periods,  (Kim 
et al., 2021b). Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model 
can be used effectively. As a result, by employing PCF with DA, we could

Helpful Answer:
The text does not explicitly state the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the target PSI, which is being classified using the trained model, has the same format as the trained PSI. It further explains that this format refers to the spatial resolution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order of each band. Given these details, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely related to satellite imagery or remote sensing data, considering the mention of spatial resolution, spectral bands, and intervals. Furthermore, the reference to Kim et al.'s (2021a) research suggests that the authors might have employed similar methods involving satellite images. Additionally, the paper cites other studies focusing on satellite imagery analysis and deep learning applications in remote sensing. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely satellite imagery or remote sensing data.
