bird image data is also a challenge, as deep learning algorithms require 
large amounts of labeled data to train effectively. The lighting condi-
tions, weather, and other environmental factors present in the image can 
also impact the appearance of birds, adding complexity to recognition. 
The dataset used to train a deep learning model may not represent the 
bird population in the wild, leading to bias and potentially impacting the 
accuracy of the model.

provide more task specific features, benefited from fine-tuning as they 
were adjusted specifically for the dataset. Across all four classifications, 
the fine-tuning strategy consistently outperformed the feature extractor 
strategy  based  on  performance  metrics  such  as  accuracy,  precision, 
recall,  and  F1  score.  The  improvement  in  accuracy  was  attributed  to 
fine-tuning the top layers of the convolutional base using the dataset. 
EfficientB0  demonstrated  superior  performance  in  all  metrics.  It  ach-
ieved  the  highest  accuracy  in  three  partitions,  with  percentages  of 
96.56%,  97.89%,  and  99.12%,  respectively.  ResNet18  requires  less 
training time because it has a smaller network size and fewer parame-
ters.  However,  ResNet18  showed  slightly  lower  performance  in  three 
partitions  with  an  accuracy  of  89.33%,  93.21%,  and  93.24%,  respec-
tively, due to its limited capacity and potential for overfitting due to its

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a dataset to train a deep learning model, which suggests that one possible method for collecting raw data could be through publicly available datasets or databases. Additionally, the context discusses challenges related to bird image data collection, including variations in lighting conditions, weather, and other environmental factors, which implies that sensor devices like cameras might have been employed to capture these images. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods were used for gathering raw data in this case.
