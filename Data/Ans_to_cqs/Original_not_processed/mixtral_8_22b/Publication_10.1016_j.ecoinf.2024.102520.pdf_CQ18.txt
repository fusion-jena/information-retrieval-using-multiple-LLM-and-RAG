4. Conclusion

application and farming practices (Fu et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; P. 
Yang  et  al.,  2022).  The  nugget  ratio  of  TSP  for  agricultural  land  use 
(14.2%) revealed a substantial geographical dependency, whereas a TSP 
ratio of 76.2% for mixed land use indicated a weak dependency. How-
ever,  false  or  incorrect  spatial  dependency  may  result  from  limited 
sampling and/or improper setting of model parameters. The extensive 
sampling employed in this work reduced sample error and increased the 
Kriging accuracy to avoid errors.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the study employs Kriging interpolation techniques to predict total nitrogen (TSN) and phosphorus (TSP) concentrations based on various soil and site parameters. To ensure the accuracy of these predictions, the authors mention using extensive sampling to reduce sample error and increase Kriging accuracy. Additionally, they discuss the importance of proper parameter settings to prevent false or incorrect spatial dependencies. Therefore, while there is no explicit discussion of monitoring strategies, one could infer that the researchers might have monitored their models by evaluating prediction accuracy through cross-validation methods or other suitable metrics.
