required  no further  user input,  pre-  or  post-processing  steps,  and  can 
therefore be seen as more objective, more comparable, and robust across 
time  steps.  Moving  the  input  period  six  months  forward,  backward, 
extending  it  to  three  instead  of  two  years,  and  testing  the  results  for 
correlation  (which  was  high)  all  supported  the  robustness  of  the 
approach.

Helpful Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general machine learning practices, common preprocessing steps may include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. These techniques help improve the quality and consistency of the input data, which can lead to better model performance. In this case, the context mentions moving the input period six months forward or backward and extending it to three instead of two years, which could suggest some form of temporal data manipulation as part of the preprocessing step. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular study, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
