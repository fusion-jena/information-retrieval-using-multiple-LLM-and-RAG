overlap with urial habitats (Table 4). The habitat corridor for the species 
covers 652.92 km2, and intersect 22 km of mining roads. In the eastern 
section,  89%  of  the  corridor  network  is  covered  by  CAs  (Fig.  4B, 
Table 5).

To  address  these  conservation  challenges,  this  study  employs  a 
comprehensive  and  innovative  methodology,  combining  ensemble 
habitat  suitability  modelling  with  cumulative  resistant  kernel  and 
factorial least-cost path techniques to predict potential habitats for each 
species and habitat connectivity, respectively. 

We  hypothesized  that  habitat  suitability  for  the  species  would 
decrease with increasing distance from conservation areas, reflecting the 
species'  avoidance  of  human  settlements  and  roads.  Through  this 
research,  our  aim  is  to  deepen  the  understanding  of  the  relationship 
between mining activities, road development, and the conservation of 
critical habitats and ecological corridors for these ungulates across the 
region.

Query: "Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any information about the location or availability of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository can be found based on the provided context alone.
