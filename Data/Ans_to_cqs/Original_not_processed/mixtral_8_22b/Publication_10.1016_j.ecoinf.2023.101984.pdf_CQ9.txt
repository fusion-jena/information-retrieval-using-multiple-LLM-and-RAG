Occurrence  data  refers  to  sets  of  coordinates  (X-Y)  where  species 
have been observed. We used the location points from the GBIF-Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/) online data-
base  to  obtain  the  coordinates  of  the  two  oak  species  in  the  Iberian 
Peninsula. The database indicated a total of 3308 occurrences of Quercus 
ilex subsp. ilex and 6739 of Quercus pubescens Willd. Based on the work of 
Hijmans (2012), in order to reduce the potential location biases in the 
species  records,  we  applied  filters  to  narrow  the  datasets,  such  as 
removing the occurrences of Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia, and delet-
ing duplicates and outliers using R and ArcGis programs. The ocurrences 
of the two oak species were standarized in 10 km grids as a way to obtain 
a homogeneous sample for use in modelling. In total, 298 locations were 
selected for Quercus pubescens Willd. and 288 for Quercus ilex subsp. ilex 
(Fig. 3).

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the occurrence data for the two oak species, Quercus ilex subsp. ilex and Quercus pubescens Willd, was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) online database. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data repository for this specific study might have been GBIF. Nevertheless, without further information or confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated that the deep learning pipeline data repository is also hosted on GBIF.
