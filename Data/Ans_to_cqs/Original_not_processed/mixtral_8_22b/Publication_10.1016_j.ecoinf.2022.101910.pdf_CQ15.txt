et al., 2021; Stowell et al., 2019). Some of the state-of-the-art techniques 
for  handling  big  datasets,  such  as  deep  learning  and  convolutional 
neural networks (Stowell, 2022; Stowell et al., 2019), can be difficult to 
run for ornithologists, managers, and researchers without bioacoustics 
or  engineering  backgrounds.  However,  user-friendly  and  ready-to-use 
machine  learning  approaches  have  recently  been  developed  and  are 
increasingly accessible to respond to real-life monitoring challenges and 
the general public (Cole et al., 2022). Among these approaches is Bird-
NET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the 
Chemnitz University of Technology. BirdNET facilitates the automated 
detection and classification of bird vocalizations, through a developed 
deep neural network, from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021). Bird-
NET is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021) and is

mainly three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensi-
tivity,  overlap  of  prediction  segments,  and  the  minimum  confidence 
threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). We set these values to 1.5 (highest allowed 
value),  1.5  s  of  overlap,  and  0.4,  respectively.  The  low  confidence 
threshold may result in increased recall and false positive rates, but the 
value employed was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. when evalu-
ating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5, Kahl et al., 
2021).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). It primarily focuses on describing the use of BirdNET, a deep learning approach for detecting and classifying bird vocalizations, and its application in various studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were utilized based solely on this context.
