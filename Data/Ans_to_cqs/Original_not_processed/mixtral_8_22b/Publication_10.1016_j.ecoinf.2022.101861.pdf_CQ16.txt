(minimum and maximum length, respectively); and a maximum inter-
syllable gap of 4 s. In this step Kaleidoscope automatically extracted all 
sounds  that  satisfied  the  signal  parameters  introduced  and  saved  the 
output.

September (Fig. 3). Maximal singing activity occurred between July and 
August, a period during which 60.2% of the total songs were detected, 
with  August  being  identified  as  the  month  with  significantly  higher 
singing  activity  according  to  Tukey’s  post-hoc  test  (Supplementary 
Fig. S3). 

4. Discussion

while recording month and site were introduced as factors. We did not 
include  in  the  analyses  those  months  with  <100  vocalizations  (from 
December to March, see results). We performed Tukey’s post-hoc tests to 
identify  differences  among  levels  of  the  factor  recording  hour  and 
recording month. Statistical analyses were run with R 3.6.2 (R Devel-
opment  Core  Team,  2019). The  package  “multcomp”  (Hothorn  et  al., 
2008) was used for Tukey’s post-hoc tests.
