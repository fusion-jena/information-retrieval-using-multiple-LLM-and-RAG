This study introduces a novel approach to soil moisture assessment in
reclaimed mining areas by integrating high-resolution topographic data
from airborne laser scanning (ALS) with spectral information from
PlanetScope imagery. We hypothesize that combining topographic
indices, such as slope, aspect, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI),

with spectral indices related to vegetation and water content will
enhance the accuracy of volumetric water content (VWC) prediction in
post-mining landscapes.

• Selected remote sensing indices, derived from PlanetScope multi-
spectral satellite imagery, allow spatial estimation of volumetric soil
water content in reclaimed areas of hard coal mine with medium
accuracy. This indicates the ability to predict VWC, but also high-
lights room for improvement. Model accuracy could be enhanced by
testing topographical indices at different spatial resolutions. Inte-
gration of microwave data could improve moisture.

4. Discussion

Knowledge of the soil retention capacity of brown coal post-
industrial heaps is limited. The first study at the spoil heap site related
to soil retention and the outflow of reclamation methods used was
conducted (Hendrychov´a and Bogusch, 2016). The type of vegetation
and type of reclamation has a direct bearing on the water content of the
heap.

Helpful Answer:
The study primarily uses two types of data formats in its deep learning pipeline - high-resolution topographic data from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spectral information from PlanetScope imagery. The ALS data provides detailed topographic features like slope, aspect, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), while the PlanetScope imagery offers multispectral satellite images. These datasets are likely used in their raw format or preprocessed into suitable formats compatible with the deep learning models employed in this research. However, it should be noted that the specific file formats (like.csv,.png, etc.) are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
