in seahorses. To this aim, citizen science surveys, social media, diving 
centers, fishing events, and questionnaires, together with joint research 
efforts and improved scientific data sharing, can help to cost- and time- 
effectively obtain and analyse a large amount of solid information on 
species occurrences (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

et  al., 2014). Further details on how to  get our  presence data can be 
found in the Data Availability section. The questionnaire included also 
details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention various sources of data collection methods such as citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. However, there is no explicit mention of any particular data annotation technique like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
