The Neural Networks were built from scratch, implemented using
TensorFlow (tf) (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras (Chollet et al., 2015).
Coupled with TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by
Google, Keras serves as a high-level Neural Networks API, offering a
seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying
deep learning models. The MCD layers consist of a modification of the
Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive
from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module (in particular, we used the
DenseVariational type of layers). These two architectures have the same
input and output layers, they differ for the structure of the hidden layers.
The size of the input layer depends on the problem we are facing: it has
two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD. As our focus will be on
dealing with regression problems, the output layer is actually a combi-
nation of a fully-connected layer (or Dense layer) with two nodes and a

siderations made earlier, a Bayesian Deep Learning model, if properly
configured and trained, can return satisfactory results even with limited
datasets, which is the scenario studied in the present work.

Fig. 4. Neural networks architecture consists of: an input layer with two nodes, one for DOY and the other for GDD; two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, Dense
layers with Monte Carlo Dropout in the MCD approach, DenseVariational layers in the VBI approach; an output layer which is the combination of a Dense layer with
two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution, used to predict the BBCH value.

Within the context of phenology prediction, applications of Deep
Learning incorporating Bayesian concepts are still sparse, if not entirely
absent. A work with a similar theme, in which Bayesian deep learning is
used to assess the health of a plant and detect possible diseases, is
(Hern´andez and L´opez, 2020). Here, the authors use Monte Carlo
Dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), a technique known to be a good
approximation of Bayesian inference, to estimate the uncertainty of a
Convolutional Neural Network. Despite achieving satisfactory results,
this work relies on the use of pre-trained models. While this can be seen

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without explicit mention, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
