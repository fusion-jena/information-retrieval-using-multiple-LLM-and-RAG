The dataset is then divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of 
the  data,  and  a  test  set  representing  the  remaining  20%,  in  order  to 
maximise model training while maintaining a sufficient amount of data 
for robust model validation (Adjuik and Davis, 2022; Fern´andez-L´opez 
et al., 2020). This division is done by random sampling to ensure that 
both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the 
risk  of  bias.  Randomisation  helps  to  preserve  the  distribution  of  key 
features  and  target  variables  across  both  training  and  test  sets, 
enhancing the generalisability of the model. We leverage the scikit-learn 
function GridSearchCV to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of 
each model within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance 
their predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation is used and the 
negative mean square error is set as the target measure. Following this

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined what type of data annotation techniques were employed, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, the context does provide details about the machine learning models used, including KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP. It also mentions various parameters associated with these models, such as alpha, l1\_ratio, neighbours, weights, p, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, max\_features, n\_estimators, learning\_rate, subsample, colsample\_bytree, reg\_alpha, gamma, min\_child\_weight, C, epsilon, hidden\_layer\_sizes, activation, and max\_iter. These parameters are likely optimized using grid search and cross-validation methods to improve the accuracy of the models.

Additionally, the context describes how the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and 20% for testing. The division was performed randomly to maintain representativeness and minimize bias. Furthermore, the negative mean squared error was chosen as the target metric for evaluating the performance of the models.

In summary, based on the available context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context provides valuable insights into the machine learning models utilized, their optimization strategies, and the evaluation metrics employed.
