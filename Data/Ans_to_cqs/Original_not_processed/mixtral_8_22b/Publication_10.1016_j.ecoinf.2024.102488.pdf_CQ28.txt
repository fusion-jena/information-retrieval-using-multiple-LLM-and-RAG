2.2. Remote sensing data 

The  remote  sensing  data  utilized  in  this  study  encompassed  GF-1 

optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. 

The  GF-1  images  used  in  this  study  were  multispectral  images 
captured with a wide-format WFV camera. The GF-1 multispectral im-
ages have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial 
resolution of 16 m. The China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and 
Application (https://data.cresda.cn) was accessed to retrieve a total of 
21  GF-1  multispectral  images  (cloud  percentage  less  than  5%)  of  the 
study area in 2020 (Fig. 3). Due to the dense cloud cover, there was no 
applicable imagery for  the  months of June,  July, or August.  All  GF-1 
multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for the 
atmosphere, and registered.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used for deployment.
