The  core  principle  of  node-based  programming  pertains  to  the 
employment of an abstracted node model for the representation of data 
or a computing operator. Each “node” accepts zero or multiple inputs and 
yields outputs subsequent to executing a computing operation. The scope 
of these computational operations encompasses elementary arithmetic 
tasks  as well  as intricate customized functions  necessitating consider-
able computational resources. (Fig. 8). 

The  intricacy  of  project  development  for  users  is  predominantly 
contingent upon the assortment of nodes supplied by both the software 
development  team  (intrinsic  default  functions)  and  community  de-
velopers  (plugin  functions).  A  robust  platform  typically  reaps  the  ad-
vantages  of  an  active  community-driven  ecosystem,  encompassing 
hundreds of plugins contributed by an array of sources. This, in turn, 
enables an extensive scope of functionality and customization for the 
end-users.

4.1. Node-based programming 

Node-based programming, also referred to as flowchart programming, 
constitutes a category of visual programming language (VPL) that enable 
users  to  construct  programs  by  graphically  connecting  a  sequence  of 
“nodes”  for  the  execution  of  logical  operations,  as  opposed  to  delin-
eating them through textual code. This methodology provides a more 
intuitive and accessible means for designing and developing software, 
particularly for individuals possessing limited programming expertise. 
Presently, it is among the most prevalent visual programming models 
employed  across  diverse  fields,  permitting  users,  including  children, 
with minimal programming knowledge to participate in programming 
activities effortlessly. Fig. 7 depicts an array of prominent software ap-
plications for visual programming (encompassing both node-based and 
non-node-based) spanning various sectors and industries.

In response to the escalating significance of environmental concerns, 
fostering interdisciplinary integration is crucial for the development of 
innovative and comprehensive solutions. The imperative for educating 
professionals across diverse fields in enhancing dialogue beyond their 
respective  disciplines has never been more pressing. As  landscape ar-
chitects  and  researchers,  we  have  engaged  in  numerous  projects  that 
encompass a broad spectrum of disciplines, acknowledging the pivotal 
role of soil science within various ecological systems. Through collab-
oration with experts in disciplines such as soil science, ecology, water 
management, and urban planning, we have recognized the need for a 
coherent communication approach that efficiently conveys information 
across  these  fields.  Accordingly,  this  paper  proposes  a  visualization 
system utilizing computational algorithms to streamline the visualiza-

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. However, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to help developers create, train, and deploy machine learning models. Without further details about the specific application or use case, I cannot recommend one over another. Please provide additional context if available so I can give a more accurate response.
