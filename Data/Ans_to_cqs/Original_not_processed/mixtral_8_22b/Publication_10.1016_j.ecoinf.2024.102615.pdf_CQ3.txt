Introduction of MLP 

Neural  networks  are  composed  of  many  interconnected  nodes, 
similar to  biological neurons.  Each node  can process weighted inputs 
from  other  nodes,  and  the  network  architecture  of  a  neural  network 
represents its arrangement of nodes. MLP is a classical model applied to 
hyperspectral data (Collins et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 2, MLP con-
sists  of  a  series  of  fully  connected  layers,  which  usually  comprise  an 
input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of nodes in 
the  input  layer  represents  the  dimensionality  of  the  input  features. 
Increasing  the  number  of  hidden  layers  can  help  the  neural  network 
learn  more  complex  problems;  however,  this  will  reduce  its  general-
ization  ability  and  increase  its  training  time.  The  output  layer  is 
responsible for producing the model’s predicted values (Atkinson and 
Tatnall, 1997).

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of neural networks, specifically Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), in hyperspectral data analysis. It also mentions the structure of MLP consisting of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Additionally, it provides details about hyperparameter tuning ranges and the optimal MLP architecture and parameters. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
