lations and adapt well to data generated by WSNs (de Wolff et al., 2021), 
if such data do not present a substantial loss of information (Liu et al., n. 
d.;  Liu  et  al.,  2018).  However,  this  represents  a  significant  challenge 
because, currently, the information generated by low-cost WSNs should 
be pre-processed, and, at the same time, the data assurance and quality 
of their growing volume of information should be maintained. Hence, 
matrix factorization (MF) (Rivera-Mu˜noz et al., 2021), and their variants 
using deep learning (Deep Matrix Factorization - DMF) emerged as an 
alternative because they can recover a significant amount of information 
that was not sampled by modeling non-linear interactions of input data 
(sensors,  time  instants).  This  property  enables  the  exploitation  of  the 
spatial-temporal  correlations  and  a  better  adaptation  to  the  data  of 
WSNs (De Handschutter et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2017a).

We  trained  algorithms  with  the  amount  of  data  available  after 
manually  removing  the  testing  set,  as  described  above.  During  the 
training, 10% of data served as the validation set to check for overfitting. 
We used a min-max scaler reverted at the end to compute the perfor-
mance metrics in the test set. In all cases, we used a batch size of 64 
samples and trained the algorithm during 100 epochs using Adam as the 
algorithm  to  optimize  the  network  parameters.  Algorithms  were 
implemented in Pytorch (Paszke et al., n.d.) and models were trained 
and tested in Google Colaboratory.2

Helpful Answer:
To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. The given context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it discusses avoiding bias generated by random data removal. One way to achieve this is through careful data partitioning, ensuring that the training, validation, and testing datasets maintain similar distributions.

The text also mentions keeping the data sets with the removed data for use with all methods. This approach could help mitigate potential biases introduced by discarding certain portions of the dataset. Additionally, the authors emphasize maintaining data assurance and quality while handling the growing volume of information from low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

Although not directly mentioned in the context, diverse data collection plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. Collecting data from various sources and under different conditions helps ensure that the model generalizes well across multiple scenarios.

In summary, based on the provided context, some techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include careful data partitioning, preserving removed data for use with all methods, and focusing on data assurance and quality. While not explicitly stated, diverse data collection is another essential technique for minimizing data bias.
