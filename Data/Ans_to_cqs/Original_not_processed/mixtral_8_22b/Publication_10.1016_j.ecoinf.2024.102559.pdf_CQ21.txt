structures (e.g., roads and buildings) and water from slowing down the 
classification processing. This step reduced the average number of pixels 
per scene the classification model had to analyze to 3,757,323 and took, 
on average, 18 s per scene.

4. Methods 

4.1. Overview 

There  are  three  phases  in  producing  iceplant  location  maps  and 
coverage statistics: creating a model to distinguish iceplant from other 
vegetation (Section 4.3), applying this model to classify all vegetation 
pixels  in  the  NAIP  scenes  covering  the  study  area  (Section  4.4),  and 
conducting an accuracy assessment on the map (Section 4.5).

containing the pixel. To improve the accuracy metrics, we followed an 
iterative process to increase the size of the training set based on inter-
mediate model training and evaluation, given that large and accurate 
training sets are preferable regardless of the algorithm used (Li et al., 
2014; Lu and Weng, 2007). This approach also allowed us to balance 
data  collection  resources  with  achieving  model  accuracy  targets.  The 
final dataset created for this project has 5442 confirmed iceplant and 
other vegetation points. The distribution of points per vegetation class, 
dataset  (train  and  test)  and  scene  are  included  in  the  supplementary 
materials (Table A.7). The accuracies obtained with the model trained 
on this dataset are shown in Table 1.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps involved in producing iceplant location maps and coverage statistics. These include applying the trained model to classify all vegetation pixels in the NAIP scenes covering the study area, conducting an accuracy assessment on the map, and generating a confusion matrix for the assessment sample classification. Additionally, structures such as roads and buildings, as well as water bodies, were removed from the images to prevent them from slowing down the classification processing. The final dataset created for this project includes 5442 confirmed iceplant and other vegetation points, which were used to train the model and achieve desired accuracy targets.
