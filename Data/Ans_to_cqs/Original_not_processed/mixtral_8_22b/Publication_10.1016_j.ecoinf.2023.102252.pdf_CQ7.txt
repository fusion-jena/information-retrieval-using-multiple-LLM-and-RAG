Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

whilst providing very reasonable data and computational requirements. 
In Section 6, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the model and 
future work. And finally, we summarize the main findings in Section 7.

was  used  as  ecological  targets  for  FERM.  Four  parameter  sets  were

The parameters used for validation were obtained through calibra-
tion  with  the  removal  of  seasonality from the  WAVES’  LAI  data.  The 
FERM output and validation data for 2009 are presented in Fig. 5 and 
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) in Table 2. The years 2009 and 
2010 are at the end of the Millennium drought and when flood depen-
dent  vegetation  will  be  in  or  close  to  their  most  stressed  conditions. 
Model performance in these years is a good indicator of the performance 
of  the  worst  possible  condition  constraints  within  the  model.  The 
Pearson correlation coefficient, in ranging from 0.61 to 0.85, suggests 
reliable  performance  of  the  minimum  condition  constraints.  This  is 
observed  qualitatively  in  Fig.  5  by  the  healthy  vegetation  distributed 
about  the  main  channel  and  poor  condition  farther  from  the  main 
channel  in  both  the  validation  map  and  the  condition  outputs  from

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the parameters used for validation were obtained through calibration with the removal of seasonality from the WAVES' LAI data. It also mentions that the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the FERM output and validation data for 2009. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data was divided into training and validation datasets, but no specific details regarding the splitting criteria have been mentioned.
