2.3. Data analysis 

In  recent  times,  the  use  of  powerful  analytical  tools  have  proven 
beneficial  in  modelling  and  predicting  the  drivers  of  invasive  species 
diversity, with immense implications in guiding invasion management 
and mitigation measures (Lenzner et al., 2019). To examine the relative 
importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables 
on  the  invasive  plant  species  richness  and  abundance  separately,  we 
employed  the  random  forest  (RF)  model  using  the  spatialRF  package 
(Benito,  2021)  in  R  4.2.2  software  (R  Core  Team,  2021).  The  RF 
modelling  approach,  a  particular  kind  of  bagging,  has  an  enhanced

The herbarium data of the selected species were then supplemented 
with  distribution  records  obtained  from  extensive  field  surveys  con-
ducted  in  the  study  region  from  March  2019  to  October  2021.  The 
random  sampling  approach  ensured  almost  equal  representation  of 
areas for field surveys across the study region. The occurence records 
showed that the selected invasive species are randomly distributed in 
the  study  region, spreading  across all  the 10  districts, which  include: 
Anantnag,  Budgam,  Bandipora,  Baramulla,  Ganderbal,  Kulgam,  Kup-
wara,  Pulwama,  Shopian  and  Srinagar  (Fig.  1).  A  total  of  747  field 
occurrence  records  of  the  selected  species  were  obtained  and  supple-
mented with the herbarium dataset to generate a final dataset of 987 
distribution records (Supplementary Material-1). The final occurrence 
records  were  aggregated  under  215  localities  with  unique  geo-

the study region. The random forest model was employed to quantify the relative contribution of these drivers to 
determine the two common diversity metrics (species richness and abundance) of selected invasive alien plants. 
We  found  that  soil  water  content  followed  by  distance  to  city,  the  maximum  air  temperature,  soil  pH,  soil 
temperature  and human  population  density  exerted the  greatest influence  on species  richness  of  the invasive 
plants. Species abundance was significantly influenced by the maximum air temperature followed by soil tem-
perature,  distance  to  city,  slope,  soil  pH  and  human  population  density.  Overall,  our  findings  help  in  disen-
tangling  the  individual  and  interactive  roles  of  multiple  drivers  of  plant  invasions,  with  wide-ranging 
implications for management in this Himalayan region and similar landscapes elsewhere.

2) What are the relative roles of these drivers in determining the rich-

ness and abundance of invasive alien species in the region?  

3)  Does the relative importance of these drivers differ between the two 

diversity metrics (i.e., species richness and abundance)?

Helpful Answer:
Handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. One commonly used strategy is fixing the random seed value. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code is executed, ensuring consistent results. This can be done using functions like numpy.random.seed() or tensorflow.random.set_seed(). Another strategy is to save and load pretrained models instead of training them from scratch every time. This eliminates the variability introduced by different initializations and training sequences. Additionally, techniques such as k-fold cross-validation and ensemble methods can also help reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.
