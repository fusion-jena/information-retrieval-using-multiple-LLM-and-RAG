cluster but a lower purity would be partially contained in other clusters 
from  the  posterior  probabilities.  Purity  measures  are  computed  as  an 
average  for  each  cluster  and  associated  site  data  and  as  an  overall 
average across all site data and associated cluster states of a latent factor 
variable. The supporting material contains these purity  measures and 
other statistics related to the clusters and resulting network (Table S4). 
The cluster analysis was constrained to a maximum of five states with 
a minimum of two, but low purity measures can exclude some candidate 
clusters. The optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in 
each  was  identified  using  an  automated  expectation-  maximization 
process, described above, based on a random walk with 300 steps for 
minimizing the MDL score. The final ten steps were used to check for 
stability  with  the  number  of  clusters  chosen  for  each  taxon.  A  stable

A  naïve  Bayesian  network  contains  a  center  node  (the  parent)  with 
predictor nodes as children. In this case, the center node is the factor 
node and the nodes for the observed reef variables are the predictors. 
The  latent  factor  node  was  constructed  through  an  expectation- 
maximization  process  that  targeted  the  similarities  in  the  monitoring 
sites  for  each  of  the  candidate  cluster  groupings.  Sherif  et  al.  (2015) 
describe the expectation-maximization process as an approach that it-
erates back and forth between expectation and maximization steps. It 
starts  with  a  ‘guess’  (expectation),then  checks  if  this  guess  can  be 
improved  (maximization)  and  then  iteratively  re-guesses  with  the 
improved values. In this case, the algorithm initially starts with random 
distributions over the cluster and reef states. In the first expectation step, 
the clusters are imputed based on these starting distributions and the

The MWST-learned network was used for the final clustering of each 
group  of  variables.  The  connections  between  nodes  for  different  taxa 
variables  were  first  removed  so  that  only  within-taxon  connections 
remained (Fig. S2). The number of factors requested for variable clus-
tering was chosen based on the number of taxa. Multiple clustering was 
used to construct a new latent factor variable for each taxon, generating 
multiple  cluster  states  within  each  latent  factor  variable.  These  four 
latent variables were then themselves clustered to create a higher-level 
latent factor variable, a meta-cluster, that summarized the cluster states 
across  taxa.  This  meta-clustering  provides  a  hierarchical  clustering 
network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from 
the measured variables across taxa. This network also includes all factor 
nodes  and  observable  nodes  from  monitoring  data  so  it  provides  an

Helpful Answer:
In machine learning pipelines, including those employing deep learning models, handling randomness is crucial to ensure consistent results and reliable performance. Randomness can arise from various sources such as initial weights, training data order, or dropout layers. To address this issue, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. Fixed Seeds: One common strategy is setting fixed seeds for random processes like weight initialization and shuffling training data. By fixing the seed, we can reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers, ensuring consistency across experiments. However, this does not eliminate randomness; rather, it makes it deterministic.

2. Ensemble Methods: Another way to mitigate the impact of randomness is by using ensemble methods. These techniques combine predictions from multiple models trained independently, often with different random seeds. This helps reduce variance and improve generalization. Examples include bagging, boosting, and stacking.

3. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is another technique used to evaluate model performance while accounting for randomness. It involves splitting the dataset into k folds, where each fold serves as a validation set once, while the remaining folds form the training set. This procedure is repeated k times, allowing every observation to contribute to both training and validation sets.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used to find optimal hyperparameters for a given problem. These methods involve trying out different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the one that yields the best performance. This process inherently accounts for randomness since it explores various configurations.

5. Regularization Techniques: Dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping are examples of regularization techniques that help prevent overfitting due to randomness. They introduce constraints during training, forcing the model to learn more robust representations.

By applying these strategies, researchers can effectively manage randomness in their deep learning pipelines, leading to more reliable and accurate results.
