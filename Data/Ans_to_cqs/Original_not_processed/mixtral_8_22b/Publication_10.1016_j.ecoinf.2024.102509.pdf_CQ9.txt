Composite (SFCC) imagery and Google Earth scenes were used for the 
selection of training sites. These were compiled into the SVM classifier 
for  generation  of  a  detailed  LULC  map  in  the  ENVI  5.3®  software 
environment  (Harris  Geospatial  Solutions,  Broomfield,  USA).  Assess-
ment of accuracy was performed by selecting 132 in-situ data points, 
which were marked as reference points for calculating the producer’s 
accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy, and overall Kappa coeffi-
cient (K^) (Roy et al., 2021).

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline data repository is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, common repositories where such datasets are often made available include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to refer to any associated publications or documentation related to the deep learning pipeline for more accurate information.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study does not directly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding dataset. Instead, the focus seems to be on using satellite images and machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) for land cover classification. The sources cited in the text primarily discuss wetlands, agroforestry, and modeling grassland biomass rather than providing details about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.
