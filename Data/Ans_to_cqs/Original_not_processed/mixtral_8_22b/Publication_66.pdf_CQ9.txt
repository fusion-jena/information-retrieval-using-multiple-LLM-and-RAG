Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available at <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t7ck5>. It can be accessed through the Dryad digital repository. However, please note that the GPS dive data are under a one-year embargo. For more information or access to this data, contact the corresponding authors.
