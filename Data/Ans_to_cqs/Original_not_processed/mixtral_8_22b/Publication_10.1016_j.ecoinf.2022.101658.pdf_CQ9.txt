Fig. 1. Field site locations in the province of Alberta, Canada. Data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) were used for training and testing the 
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. Data collected at Conklin (CK) were used solely for independent validation. 

overview of the methodological steps taken and associated datasets used 
at each step is shown in Fig. 2.

our study, is due to the deep learning method’s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

steps.  Field  measurements  were 
collected at three field sites: Pelican Moun-
tain  (PM),  Calling  Lake  (CL)  and  Conklin 
(CK). Manual classification of fuel types used 
in  semantic  segmentation  training  and 
testing were limited to data collected at PM 
and  CL.  Field  measurement  data  and  raw 
photos  from  the  CK  field  site  were  used 
solely for independent validation. R refers to

exposure settings could potentially be used to standardize images and 
enable  distributed  data  collection  of  nadir  photographs  by  groups  of 
personnel  working  at  different  times  of  the  day  and  using  different 
brands of smartphones. Future work could also explore techniques such 
as active learning and pre-training on new semantically related datasets. 
Potential  long-term  implications  of  this  research  include  eventual 
development of a smartphone-based app to quickly and automatically 
estimate percent ground cover and surface biomass loadings in forest 
ecosystems. In recent years, smartphone applications have enabled the 
public to contribute to data collection and participate in citizen science 
programs  (e.g.  iNaturalist,  NoiseTube,  Secchi).  With  crowd-sourcing, 
ground  cover  observations  can  be  collected  in  quantities  that  far 
exceed  those  of  research  programs  that  rely  solely  on  trained  pro-
