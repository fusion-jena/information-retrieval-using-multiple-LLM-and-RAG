features; ReLU (The Rectified Linear Unit) refers to the activation function, which is used to perform nonlinear mapping of the output results of the convolutional 
layer; the pooling layer (this study uses max pooling) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature map; the fully connected layers are used to classify input images 
into labels.

CNN has different architectures, such as Le-Net, Alex-Net, Res-Net, 
CapsuleNet, High-Resolution Networks, etc. (Kattenborn et al., 2021). 
This study employs the AlexNet architecture, among the earliest deep 
CNNs  proposed  by  Krizhevsky  et  al.  (2012),  applied  successfully  in 
image scene classification tasks (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021d). 
AlexNet's  triumph  is  attributed  to  practical  strategies  like  ReLU 
nonlinear  layers  and  dropout  regularization  techniques,  making  it 
effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent 
for handling complex problems (Han et al., 2017). Compared to other 
CNN models (e.g., VGG and ResNet), the AlexNet model has a simpler 
structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train 
and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex 
problems (Pu et al., 2019).

patterns  influencing  algal  blooms  over  different  periods,  fostering  a 
deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics. Such 
insights are crucial for developing targeted strategies for the prevention 
and management of algal blooms.

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:

The pipeline described in this study utilizes a specific type of deep learning model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be seen from several references made throughout the text. For instance, Fig. 3 explicitly mentions the use of a CNN model architecture, detailing its various components including convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Furthermore, the authors mention employing the AlexNet architecture, one of the earliest deep CNNs proposed by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), which was successful in image scene classification tasks. They also discuss how compared to other CNN models, the AlexNet model has a simpler structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, making it easier to train and optimize while still having enough computational power to handle complex problems. Therefore, it is clear that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN, specifically the AlexNet architecture.
