Yuan et al. (2022) claimed that the superior performance of a ViT can 
primarily be attributed to extensive pre-training data. If a ViT is trained 
from  scratch  on  a  medium-sized  dataset,  its  performance  lags  behind 
that of a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this 
limitation, they proposed Volo with the novel Outlook Attention as the 
token mixer module, which enabled fine-grained token representation 
and the aggregation of global information. 

2.3. MLP-like model

The basic models were trained using a deep transfer-learning strat-
egy based on fine-tuning. The model parameters were initialized using a 
pre-trained model. The final classification layer was then replaced by a 
fully connected layer, aligning its output dimension with the number of 
classes  in  the  target  dataset.  Subsequently,  all  parameters  across  the 
layers were fine-tuned on the target dataset. The basic models in all the 

The  performances  of  the  four  basic  models  and  two  proposed 
ensemble  methods  on  the  IP102  dataset  are  lised  in  Table  2.  The 
parameter  sizes  of  the  four  basic  models  were  comparable,  with 
approximately 24 M parameters for each model. However, there was a 
significant variation in the performances of the basic models, as shown 
in Table 2. ViP-Small/7 exhibited the lowest performance, whereas the 
two  transformer-like  models  demonstrated  better  performance,  with 
Volo-d1 achieving the highest performance.

2.1. CNN-like model 

CNN is a classical model in CV, renowned for its robust translational 
invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet, 
proposed by He et al. (2016), is a well-known CNN model with a core 
structure of residual units. This innovative design addresses the issue of 
gradient disappearance as the number of layers increases. This allows for 
a  greater  depth  in  the  network,  leading  to  the  extraction  of  more 
expressive  features.  ResNet  has  exhibited  superior  performance 
compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and 
detection tasks.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it appears that the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is AdamW with parameters (0.9, 0.999). AdamW is a variant of the popular Adam optimizer, which combines the advantages of both Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). It uses adaptive estimates of lower-order moments to update the weights and biases of the neural network during backpropagation. The parameters (0.9, 0.999) correspond to the exponential decay rates for the first and second moment estimates, respectively. These values control how much influence past gradients have on the current gradient update. Overall, AdamW is known for its fast convergence and good generalization performance, making it a popular choice for many deep learning applications.
