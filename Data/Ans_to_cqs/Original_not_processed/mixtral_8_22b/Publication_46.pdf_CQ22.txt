Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better
accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including
ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized
in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better ﬁt the occurrence scenarios of the
species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including
MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS.
The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve
(AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68
with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for
species distribution over BIOCLIM.

The features extracted by the convolution layers followed by downsampling by the
pooling layers are mapped using a subset of fully connected layers to the ﬁnal output
of the network. The fully connected layer is executed with the ReLU function [65,66].
Mathematically, the Rectiﬁer can be described as:

f (x) = x+= max(0, x)

(2)

where x is the input to the neuron. A unit employing the Rectiﬁer is known as the Rectiﬁer
linear unit (ReLU).

The performance evaluation of the model is conducted by tuning the learnable param-
eters, kernels, and weight by a loss function through the forward propagation followed by
updating these parameter values through an optimization algorithm either by backpropa-
gation or gradient descent.

kappa, with values 0.652 and 0.94, respectively, also gave support to the applicability of
CNN in comparison to conventional SDM’s such as BIOCLIM. These values showcase the
superiority of deep learning models for species probability distribution using the given set
of ecological and bioclimatic parameters.

Helpful Answer:

The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using several metrics. The primary metric mentioned in the provided context is the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value for the CNN model was found to be 0.917, while it was 0.68 for the BIOCLIM model. This indicates the superiority of the CNN model for species distribution compared to the BIOCLIM model.

Additionally, the Kappa statistic is used to measure the agreement between predicted and observed values, resulting in values of 0.94 for the CNN model and 0.76 for the BIOCLIM model. Another metric used is True Skill Statistics (TSS), with a value of 0.652 for the CNN model and 0.44 for the BIOCLIM model. These values further demonstrate the superiority of deep learning models like CNN for species probability distribution using the given set of ecological and bioclimatic parameters.
