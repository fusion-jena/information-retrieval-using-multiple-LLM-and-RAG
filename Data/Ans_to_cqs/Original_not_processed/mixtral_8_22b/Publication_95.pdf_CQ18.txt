of 832 × 832 pixels for the six classes of plant species. The average training loss was
used to determine when to stop the training. Redmon and Farhadi recommends at least
2000 iterations for each number of classes, but 22 000 iterations were chosen, as the training
loss was stabilized after this number of iterations. The trained YOLOv3 model was tested
using the images from the test data set scaled to a pixel size of 608 × 608.

Table 2. Overview of training, validation, and test set. C, I, and P are the number of clusters, images,
and polygons of each species in the respective data sets. A cluster consists of multiple images
acquired from the same location — potentially across multiple dates. An image contains zero, one, or
multiple annotations.

Figure 8. Recall of the ResNet50V2 models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size.
The validation images were binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image
size (“annotation size”). Each line shows the recall (left axis) of a ResNet50V2 model with a given input image size across
the binned annotation sizes. The recall lines were “smoothed”, using kernel density estimation. The number of images in
each bin is shown as vertical bars (right axis).

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to use the average training loss. This metric was used to determine when to stop the training process. In this case, the authors chose to perform 22,000 iterations, as the training loss stabilized after this number of iterations.
