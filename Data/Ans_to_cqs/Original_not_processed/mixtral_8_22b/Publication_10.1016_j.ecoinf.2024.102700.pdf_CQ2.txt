analysis. However, while regression-based models remain prevalent (n
= 23), there was an increased use of machine learning techniques (n =
22), particularly Maxent, and, although limited, deep learning strategies
(e.g., neural networks, Cazau et al., 2023), likely suggesting a shift to-
wards machine learning methodologies (Maglietta et al., 2023). Another
notable trend was the increased incorporation of anthropogenic vari-
ables in modelling to assess the influence of human activity on species
habitat use, especially related to fishing and boating activities (n = 7
studies; e.g., Díaz L´opez and Methion, 2024).

When preparing SDMs, assembling an appropriate species occur-
rence dataset is crucial. The occurrence data used for distribution
modelling were predominantly visual (n = 248, 84%), while only a
minority came from the use of satellite tracking (n = 37, 13%) or
acoustic recordings (n = 31, 11%). The percentages are calculated based
on the total number of reviewed articles. To be correctly interpreted, it
should be noted that a few studies utilised a combination of different
data types, such as both visual and acoustic recordings (n = 18) or visual
and tracking data (n = 3). In contrast, for sea turtles, most data were
from satellite tracking devices (n = 12, 67%) rather than visual data (n
= 6, 33%), as evidenced by Fig. 5A. The occurrence dataset, regardless
of data type, mostly covered short to medium period of 2–5 years (n =
89, 30%) and 6–10 years (n = 77, 26%). A considerable proportion also
covered long-term periods of 11–30 years (n = 64, 22%), but rarely

Helpful Answer:
The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some details about the data types used in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) preparation. Visual data was the most commonly used data type (84%), followed by satellite tracking data (13%) and acoustic recordings (11%). For sea turtle studies, satellite tracking devices were more common (67%) compared to visual data (33%). It should be noted that these data types do not directly translate into specific file formats like images, audio, video, or CSV. Nonetheless, visual data could potentially include images or videos, while acoustic recordings might involve audio files. Satellite tracking data would typically consist of location coordinates and timestamps, which could be stored in various formats, including CSV. Without further context, it isn't possible to definitively determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
