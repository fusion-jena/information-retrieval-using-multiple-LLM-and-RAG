2.3.3. Optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD)  

(i)  Optimal scale and discretization parameters 

As OPGD requires continuous data to be discretized before further 
analysis,  choosing  appropriate  discretization  parameters  (i.e.,  the 
number and method of discretization breakpoints) is crucial for accurate 
identification  of  driver  explanatory  power.  The  discretization  process 
involved  five  methods:  standard  deviation  (SD),  natural  breaks  (NB), 
equal  interval  (EI),  quantile  (QU),  and  geometric  interval  (GI)(Song 
et al., 2020). Following previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 
2023), we considered that too many or too few breakpoints would result 
in  information  redundancy  (insufficiency).  Therefore,  the  number  of 
breakpoints was configured to range from 4 to 13 in this study.

The Q value, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver in 
the OPGD, is also influenced by the size of the OPGD data sampling grid. 
It is common to compare the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers 
at different spatial scales and select the optimal sampling grid based on 
the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest(Song et al., 2020; Yu 
et al., 2023). In this paper, Q values for each driver were compared at 
grid scales of 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km, 3 km*3 km, 4 km*4 km, 5 km*5 
km and 6 km*6 km.  

(ii)  Factor detector 

The factor detector assesses the independent explanatory power of 
each driver in relation to the spatial variance in the kNDVI using the Q

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what hardware resources such as GPUs, TPUs, etc., were used for training the deep learning model.
