3.3. Visual Analysis

Some features maps, learned by the convolutional layers, are presented in Figure 12.
Speciﬁcally, this image presents low-, mid- and high-level feature maps learned by the
ﬁrst, a middle, and the last layers of the networks, respectively. We can see the each CNN
performs very differently from one another.

Therefore, our originality comes from the dataset and the exertion of deep learning
algorithms to improve the nature conservation efforts in this region, and our primary con-
tribution is related to the investigation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods
to detect trees in urban areas. For this task, we used data with a high spatial resolution
(Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 10 cm) inside an urban area inside the Cerrado biome
and used ﬁve state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to process the data. Deep learning-
based approaches designed to tackle this task receive, as input, an image and return as
output, another image, generally with the exact size of the input data with each pixel
associated with one class. We choose to use deep learning because they present a better
performance in semantic segmentation and scene interpretation tasks over traditional
machine learning and trained professionals in many ﬁelds of science as demonstrated
by [38–42].

The most signiﬁcant variation of performance is concerning the number of parameters
and with training and inference time. Despite being the best architecture in performance,
According to Table 2, DeepLabv3+ needed more parameters than the other architectures,
about 2.75 times more parameters than the U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a
more signiﬁcant number of parameters often implies a higher demand for training samples
that our dataset or another dataset may not have met that the methods present in this
research paper may be applied, possibly causing the DeepLabV3+ architecture to perform
below its potential.

in (Figure 5). SegNet is also an encoder-decoder network path like U-Net, but with the
replacement of the deconvolution layers by unpooling operations to increase the spatial
resolution of the initial prediction map generated by the encoder. Ref. [46] proposed this
architecture based on the VVG 16 network developed by [47]. A scheme of deep network
SegNet is shown in (Figure 6).
