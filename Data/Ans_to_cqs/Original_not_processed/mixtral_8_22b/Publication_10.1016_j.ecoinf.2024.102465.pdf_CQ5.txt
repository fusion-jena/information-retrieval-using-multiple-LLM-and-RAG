The study employs the HRNet model due to its high accuracy and 
stability. HRNet effectively performs semantic segmentation by simul-
taneously  merging  high-resolution  and  low-resolution  convolution 
computations (Sun et al., 2019). By using HRNet to model social media 
image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, 
in combination with graphics processing software for proofreading, the 
greenness, blueness, and sky openness index can be derived using the 
formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). G indicates the level of greenery 
in  the  panoramic  image;  PGreenness  is  the  total  number  and  amount  of 
pixels  corresponding  to  vegetative  and  green  spaces  identified  in  the 
semantic segmentation process; PTotal  represents the overall number of 
pixels specified in the image; O represents the level of openness in the 
panoramic image; PSky denotes the percentage of identified sky elements

57 traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China. The experimental steps are 
as follows: (1) Quantitatively analyze the text data and pictures obtained 
from Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo platforms by cleaning and organizing 
them. (2) Score social media data for villages and determine the average 
sentiment  index  using  NLP  technology  based  on  LSTM  and  CNN.  (3) 
Organize  corresponding  image  datasets  into  text  data,  quantify  them 
using  semantic  segmentation  based  on  Hrnet  and  image  complexity 
calculation based on Matlab, and visualize the average quantified data 
of different villages using ArcMap software. (4) The dataset was divided 
into a training set and a test set before constructing the XGBoost model. 
(5) The SHAP method was utilized to examine how elements of the built 
environment,  as  captured  in  photographs,  influence  the  sentiment 
index. This research provides a scientific foundation for refining rural

Helpful Answer:

Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses image datasets from social media platforms such as Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo. These datasets consist of both textual and visual content related to traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China. The text data is analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Meanwhile, the image data is processed using High-Resolution Net (HRNet) for semantic segmentation and Matlab for image complexity calculation. However, specific details about the exact nature or size of these datasets are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide more precise information regarding their similarities or differences compared to popular benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
