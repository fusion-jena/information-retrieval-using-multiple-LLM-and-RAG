2.6. Training and validation set 

The  study  utilized  a  training-and-test  approach  with  stratification 
splitting. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set 
were given. Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done 
for  each  set.  This  was  followed  by  model  training  using  an  optimal 
setting of the hyperparameter. 

2.7. Regression models 

Four methods were used to model forest AGB in the study: AdaBoost, 
random  decision  forest  (RF),  multilayer  neural  network  (NET),  and 
Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

In  recent  years,  nonparametric  machine  learning  models  have 
become  predominant  for  quantifying  forest  biomass  within  a  space 
based  on  ALS  data  (Ali  et  al.,  2015;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Machine

Random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression). The results show that canopy 
conditions and airborne LiDAR point densities did not affect the strength of the AGB model, but that model's 
strength was affected by the vegetation regeneration component in the field biomass reference and by the ma-
chine  learning  method  tested  for  modelling.  AdaBoost  and  random  decision  forest  were  the  most  successful 
methods. To evaluate the quality of an AGB model it is recommended to combine several individual evaluation 
functions into the model score. The study highlights several recommendations to follow when estimating AGB 
from ALS using an ABA in Central European forests.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, however, we can infer that its primary function is likely related to regression analysis. Four methods are mentioned for modeling forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB): AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). These methods suggest that the deep learning model is being used for predictive or analytical purposes rather than tasks such as image classification, segmentation, or object detection. Furthermore, the use of terms like'model tuning', 'hyperparameters', and 'optimal settings' indicate that these models are being employed for regression analysis. Therefore, while the specific purpose isn't directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the deep learning model is being used for regression analysis to estimate forest AGB.
