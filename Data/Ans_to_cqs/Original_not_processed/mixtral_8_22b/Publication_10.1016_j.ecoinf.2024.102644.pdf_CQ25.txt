basin is a critical tourist attraction due to its rich biodiversity, making it an area of interest for citizens, tourists, 
and scientists. However, the region’s suitability for native and non-native species is at risk due to climate and 
land-use change. Using machine-learning models, we predict the potential effects of climate change on animal 
spatial  distribution  in  the  basin  under  different  greenhouse  gas  emission  scenarios.  The  results  suggest  that 
habitat suitability has generally improved from 1950 to today, presumably owing to the targeted conservation 
strategies adopted in the area, but climate change will severely reduce bird biodiversity by 2050 while favouring 
several insect species’ proliferation and other species’ habitat change, even under a medium-emission scenario. 
This will lead to significant changes in the basin’s biodiversity. Our methodology is adaptable to other wetland

Fig. 3. Overall schema of our modelling approach: Input data from 2016 were used to train MaxEnt-based ecological niche models (a). Each MaxEnt model was fed 
with  species  occurrence  and  prevalence  data  (b)  to  produce spatial  species  distributions  over  the  years  for  180  species  (c),  which  were  then  binarised  through 
thresholding (d). Finally, species richness was obtained through model overlapping and summing (e).

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model is being used for ecological niche modeling. This type of modeling involves using species occurrence and prevalence data to predict the geographic distribution of species. In this case, the model is being used to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in a specific basin. It appears that the model is trained using MaxEnt, a popular algorithm for ecological niche modeling, and produces spatial species distributions over time for multiple species. These distributions are then binarized through thresholding and combined to obtain species richness. Therefore, the overall goal of the model seems to be to provide insights into how climate change may impact biodiversity in the basin.
