The training/validation module consists of the following steps: (1) the 
selected images are annotated by experienced analysts (delineating and 
assigning each fish to a class); (2) two different models are trained with 
these data: One for automatic fish segmentation and another for clas-
sification  by  species  of  these  segments.  For  manual  annotation,  100 
images from four different fishing sets were annotated, obtaining a total 
of 975 individual fishes (segments).

Helpful Answer:
Answer: The text mentions that the selected images are annotated by experienced analysts who delineate and assign each fish to a class. This suggests that the data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline involves instance segmentation, where each individual fish is outlined or delineated within the image. Instance segmentation allows for more precise identification and localization of objects compared to other methods like bounding box annotation. In addition, since each fish is assigned to a specific class during the annotation process, it can be inferred that classification labels are also applied to the instances, which further enriches the dataset for training the deep learning models.
