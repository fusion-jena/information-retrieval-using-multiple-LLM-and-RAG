Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources were likely used based on the references cited. These include surveys of breeding penguins and other seabirds (Shuford & Spear, 1988), engaging 'the crowd' in remote sensing (Stammerjohn & Barrington, 2020), applications of unmanned aerial vehicles in Antarctic environmental research (Tovar-Sánchez et al., 2021), and using citizen scientists for animal counts from drone imagery (Wood et al., 2021). Additionally, there is mention of utilizing satellite images (Witharana & Lynch, 2016) and flights of drones over sub-Antarctic seabirds (Weimerskirch et al., 2018). Therefore, it appears that a combination of traditional field surveys, crowdsourcing, remote sensing techniques such as drones and satellites, and potentially publicly available datasets may have been employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
