grass rush pasture in GMEP. However, if contextual datasets were pro-
vided, these classes could be absorbed in appropriate wetland classes in
the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

For the ML model, training and testing datasets were generated
through reference to existing field datasets and VHR images (Section
2.4.3, Table 2). Areas dominated by the target communities were digi-
tised as polygons and all pixels contained were extracted. These poly-
gons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with ~30% of
pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation. Splitting
polygons rather than pixels minimises the effect of spatial autocorrela-
tion on model accuracies (Karasiak et al., 2022). We used a python
implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) to
classify the VTs, given optimised random trees can be developed
whereby each new tree learns from the errors of those previous. As input
to the ML algorithm, the seasonal vegetation index composites from S2,
backscatter composites from S1, elevation and slope were used, totalling
up to 54 features (Appendix-A). The compositing periods were chosen

a) Step-1: Comparing LWHabmod and GMEPmod (actual accuracies)
b) Step-2: Applying decision rules based on the peat depth, particularly
those affecting wetland/bog classes, to modify GMEPmod data labels.
c) Step-3: Applying decision rules (in addition to Step-2) based on the
Phase-1 Habitat map, and particularly those impacting on the clas-
sification of grassland, heathland, and scrub classes, to modify the
GMEPmod data labels.

These exercises were repeated for the broad habitat classes by

modifying the GMEPBHmod labels through Step-2 and Step-3.

2.6.2. Accuracy assessment for Pembrokeshire County

We undertook a dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats,
in Pembrokeshire in 2022 (Fig. 2) using the EarthTrack mobile appli-
cation developed through Living Wales (https://earthtrack.aber.ac.uk/)
