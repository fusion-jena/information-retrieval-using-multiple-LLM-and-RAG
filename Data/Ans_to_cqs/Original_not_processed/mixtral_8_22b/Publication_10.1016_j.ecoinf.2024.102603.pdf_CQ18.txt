and involve lengthier training times compared to the computationally 
efficient XGBoost [Joshi et al., 2023]. Moreover, the interpretability of 
these models varies significantly. XGBoost stands out by offering feature 
importance scores and decision rules, contributing to a clearer under-
standing  of  its  decision-making  process.  Conversely,  deep  learning 
models  often  carry  the  label  of  “black  box”  due  to  their  complexity, 
making it challenging to interpret and comprehend how they arrive at 
specific predictions [Wu et al., 2021]. Additionally, the performance on 
small  datasets  is  another  distinctive  factor.  XGBoost  demonstrates 
effectiveness  even  with  limited  data  [Chen  and  Guestrin,  2016;  Jing 
et al., 2022], while deep learning models generally require substantial 
datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 
2022].

The XGBoost model does not have an analytical form and is obtained 
through numerical optimization of the error function in successive it-
erations. According to specific criteria, the algorithm takes the form of a 
so-called  ensemble  model  and  is  based  on  regression  decision  trees 
(CART)  that  partition  the  example  space  using  a  divide-and-conquer 
method, aiming to introduce maximum order to the data. The training 
(spectral-vegetation  indices  referring  to  Table  2)  and  validation 
(ground-based  Fv/Fm  measurements)  sets  were  divided  in  an  80:20 
ratio. XGBoost trains a series of trees, with each subsequent tree starting 
its  learning  process  anew,  taking  into  account  the  correction  for  the 
residual values of the previous tree. The error value (residual value in 
the context of classical regression) made by each tree for each element of

the examined population is recorded and utilized by the next tree in line 
to improve the previous results. 

To assess the model's performance, we used the leave-one-out pro-
cedure for cross-validation [Hastie et al., 2001]. It maximizes the use of 
available data, reduces bias in performance estimation, and is particu-
larly  useful  for  small  datasets,  as  it  rigorously  assesses  model  perfor-
mance by iterative training on all but one sample and evaluating the 
excluded  sample.  The  following  metrics  were  calculated  for  model 
performance:  the  coefficient  of  determination  (R2),  as  well  as  Mean 
Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative 
Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).

Helpful Answer:

Answer: To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation. This method maximizes the utilization of available data, minimizes bias in performance estimation, and is particularly beneficial for small datasets. By iteratively training the model on all but one sample and then evaluating the excluded sample, this approach provides a thorough assessment of the model's performance. Furthermore, several metrics were computed to evaluate the model's performance, including the coefficient of determination (R^2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).
