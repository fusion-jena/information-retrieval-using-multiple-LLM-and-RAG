4.2. Ensemble models

2.7. Subsetting background points 

We  made  three  random  selections  of  background  points  from  the 
training dataset for use during model construction. First, we made the 
“1×” selection, which selected the same number of background points as 
presences in the training dataset. Second, we made the “10×” selection, 
which selected a number of background points equal to ten times the 
number of presences in the training dataset. Third, we made the “10 K” 
selection, which selected 10,000 background points from the training 
dataset.  We  used  this  approach  to  maintain  consistency  across  back-
ground  points  used  to  train  each  model  so  there  was  no  variation  in 
model results due to variation in the response variable.

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, common strategies include setting a fixed random seed value or using techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure reproducibility and robustness of the results.

Answer:::

Unhelpful Answer:
The text discusses the use of ensemble models and subsetting background points in ecological modeling but does not mention any strategies related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what strategies are employed based solely on the given context.

Answer:::

Answer: The text does not explicitly state how randomness in the deep learning pipeline is handled. However, one strategy mentioned in the context is maintaining consistency across background points used to train each model. This could be interpreted as a way to reduce variability introduced by random processes. Other general strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value, using cross-validation, and employing bootstrapping methods. These techniques help ensure reproducibility and robustness of the results.
