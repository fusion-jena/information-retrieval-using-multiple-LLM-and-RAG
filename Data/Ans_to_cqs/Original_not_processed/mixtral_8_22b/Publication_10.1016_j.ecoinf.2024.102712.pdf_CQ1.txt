Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that Sentinel-2 provides data that can be used in various modeling frameworks and combined with other types of data. This suggests that remote sensing data from satellites like Sentinel-2 could potentially be one source of raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Other sources of raw data mentioned indirectly include those used in model-assisted frameworks and hierarchical modeling, but no further details about these methods are provided. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what methods are used for collecting raw data based on this context alone, it does suggest that satellite imagery and possibly survey or sensor data may play a role in some cases.
