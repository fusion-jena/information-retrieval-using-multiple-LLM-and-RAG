Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Development of automated classification routines, if accurate, serves to 
improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of 
analyzing large datasets.

BANTER  may  serve  as  an  option  for  automated  machine  learning 
classification.

Advances in computing have led to a dramatic increase in the op-
portunities  to  use  machine  learning  for  bioacoustic  classification 
(Bianco et al., 2019; Mutanu et al., 2022; Stowell, 2022). In particular, 
use of deep neural networks show great promise for large datasets on a 
wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals (Frainer et al., 2023; 
Frasier et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Rom´an Ruiz et  al., 2023; Zhong 
et al., 2020). Neural networks typically require significant sample sizes 
for all classes, although there are increasingly new tools to enhance data 
or combined disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; 
Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 
2019).  There  is  a  significant  learning  curve  to  understand  how  to

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for classification tasks. The development of automated classification routines aims to improve efficiency, reduce subjectivity, and decrease costs when analyzing large datasets. BANTER is mentioned as an option for automated machine learning classification, indicating that it could be used for such purposes. Furthermore, advances in computing have enabled the increased use of machine learning for bioacoustic classification, particularly with deep neural networks. These networks have shown great potential for classifying large datasets across various taxa, including marine mammals. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary goal of these deep learning models appears to be the classification of different species or categories within the dataset.
