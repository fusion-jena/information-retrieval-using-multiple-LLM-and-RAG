2.2. Algorithms 

We used five machine-learning algorithms based on three different 
principles: a pre-trained convolutional neural network (AlexNet); three 
boosting-based  classifiers  (AdaBoost  Adaptive  Boosting,  Gradient 
Boosting,  and  Histogram-based  Gradient  Boosting);  and  a  linear 
discriminant  model.  Here,  we  briefly  describe  the  characteristics  of 
these algorithms and the inputs that they require; further details can be 
found in the references provided below. 

The  architecture  of  AlexNet  (‘AN’  hereafter),  which  includes  five 
convolutional  layers  and  three  fully-connected  layers,  has  60  million

Automated identification of Chagas disease vectors has the potential 
to strengthen entomological surveillance systems – which are currently 
weak, and overall getting weaker, across Latin America. To realize such 
potential fully, automated identification algorithms should be capable of 
working accurately with pictures of uneven, possibly low quality/reso-
lution taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. Our results suggest that 
convolutional  neural  networks  may  indeed  have  that  capacity,  and, 
hence, that human expertise and artificial intelligence could team up to 
provide  fast,  reliable  taxonomic  support  to  ‘extended’  (or  ‘hybrid’), 
participatory  surveillance  systems  with  broad  geographic-ecological 
scope. However, not all triatomine bug species have the same public- 
health relevance, so future research should focus on combining mixed- 
quality  pictures and pre-trained neural networks to identify adult tri-

database into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), and then trained and tested a convolutional neural network 
(AlexNet,  AN);  three  boosting-based  classifiers  (AdaBoost,  AB;  Gradient  Boosting,  GB;  and  Histogram-based 
Gradient Boosting, HB); and a linear discriminant model (LD). We assessed identification accuracy and speci-
ficity with logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. Differences in perfor-
mance across algorithms were mainly driven by AN’s essentially perfect accuracy and specificity, irrespective of 
picture angle or bug position. HB predicted accuracies ranged from ~0.987 (Panstrongylus, dorsal-oblique) to 
>0.999  (Triatoma,  dorsal-flat).  AB  accuracy  was  poor  for  Rhodnius  (~0.224–0.282)  and  Panstrongylus 
(~0.664–0.729), but high for Triatoma (~0.988–0.991). For Panstrongylus, LD and GB had predicted accuracies

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is for classification. Specifically, it aims to automatically identify Chagas disease vectors using data mining and deep learning techniques. This involves distinguishing between different triatomine bug species, including Rhodnius, Triatoma, and Panstrongylus, based on images captured with ordinary cellphone cameras. The goal is to improve entomological surveillance systems in Latin America by providing fast, reliable taxonomic support through 'extended' or 'hybrid', participatory surveillance systems with broad geographical-ecological scope.
