CNN comes with the disadvantages of a huge number
of labelled training samples requirement for weighting pa-
rameters and powerful GPUs for a faster learning process.
With limited training samples, learning too many parameters
directly will result in overﬁtting even after using over-ﬁtting
prevention techniques such as Dropout [7]. Overﬁtting of a
machine learning model includes more terms and uses more
complicated approaches than necessary [8]. To make deep
CNN ﬁt for small datasets while keeping high accuracy is
a challenge. To overcome this challenge, transfer learning [9]
offers the solution, which implies reusing previously attained
knowledge in similar tasks. Some studies analyzed the use
of transfer learning for many deep learning algorithms. These
evaluations [10] concluded that transfer learning improves the
accuracy of deep learning models, which apply deep features
and ﬁne-tuning.

App Development: For tree species identiﬁcation in a remote
area, an end-user app is essential. For the app development,
Android Studio [39] was used. The saved models were
converted into the TensorFlow Lite [40] version using the
TensorFlow Lite converter. TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools
to perform deep learning on smartphone and IoT devices. The
architecture of the mobile app is shown in Fig. 4. The squares
marked with dotted red will be included in future iterations.
The size of the models based on MobileNetV3-Large and
MobileNetV3-Small was 4.88 MB and 1.99 MB, respectively,
which are lightweight compared to AlexNet (227.5 MB) [27].
The app is developed using the Java programming language.
The leaf detection module in the app contains a Tensorﬂow
Lite interpreter for the TensorFlow Lite model.
App Testing: For testing the application, Android studio
comes with built-in phone emulators, or the app could be
deployed to an actual device. From an online search, we

D. Model Training

Feature Extraction: The hardware to train the model included
a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz
of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-
bit system. The software tools included Annaconda3 Jupyter
Notebook with Python 3.8, where the Tensorﬂow, OpenCV-
python3 [37] and Keras [38] libraries were used. The dataset
was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789
images and a test set of 1930 images. To obtain the pre-
trained weight parameters, we built the base models from the
MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small

models, pre-trained on 1.4M images from 1000 classes. First,
the intermediate layer of all the models was selected to use
for feature extraction. For this purpose, the output of the last
layer (bottleneck layer) is commonly used prior to the ﬂatten
operation. The reason is that all the fully connected layers
are specialized to the task network was trained on; thus, the
features learned by these layers will not be useful for the new
task. The bottleneck features are more generic. Therefore, the
base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the
ImageNet dataset and used as a feature extractor. We added
a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce the
overﬁtting of the model. Finally, the top classiﬁer softmax
layer was added for predicting the class for an input image.
The model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled
and optimized with Adam optimizer. The other with the base
model of MobileNetV3 were optimized with Gradient descent

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't any information provided about the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given text. It does not mention whether the dataset used for training the models is publicly accessible or if it has been uploaded to platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the author mentions that they utilized a dataset consisting of 5789 images for training and 1930 images for testing purposes. This dataset appears to have been derived from 1.4 million images belonging to 1000 different classes. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the source of the dataset or its availability, it remains unclear where the data repository can be found.
