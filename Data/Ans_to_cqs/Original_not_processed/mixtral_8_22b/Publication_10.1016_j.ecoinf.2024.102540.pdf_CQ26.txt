Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting, 
and Random Trees (Yang et al., 2010). However, a growing subarea in 
machine learning, called deep learning, can leverage large image data-
sets  to train  deep neural networks such as  Convolutional Neural  Net-
works (CNNs) (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015) to make accurate predictions 
on new, unseen images.

2.3. Imagery splitting ratio 

We split the dataset in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and 
testing sets, respectively. This ratio was used due to prior evidence of 
exceed performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep 
learning models (Kiratiratanapruk et al., 2022; Krishnadas and Sampa-
thila, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2019). The training dataset consisted of 
1543 images, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the 
testing set and all were at input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels. The 1280 
× 1280 pixels input resolution consisted of 1637 images for the training 
set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set. 
Independently,  we  trained  5  different  versions  of  the  YOLOv5  model 
family  including:  YOLOv5n,  YOLOv5s,  YOLOv5m,  YOLOv5l,  and 
YOLOv5x models to detect alates on sorghum leaves. 

2.4. Characteristics of deep learning models

2.5. Description of hyperparameters and training aspects 

The  five  detection  models  were  trained  using  a  manually  labeled 
image dataset for alate detection. After conducted initial computational 
experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400 and 500 
with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, it was determined that the optimal 
hyperparameters for our training were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8 
and were constant when comparing the five detection models using 640 
× 640, and 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolutions on each model type. 
The batch defines the number of samples to be worked through before 
moving on to update the internal model parameters (Radiuk, 2017). The 
epoch  number  used  in  training  determines  the  number  of  times  the 
detection model processes the dataset dedicated to training the model 
(Brownlee,  2018).  The  computer  infrastructure  used  for  training 

2.6. Evaluation metrics of the trained models

Usually,  growers  or  entomologists  manually  monitor  pests  using 
morphology keys, pest guides, and images to match key characteristics 
with  common  genera  and  species  names  reported  in  the  literature 
(Bishop and Hutchings, 2011). However, using machine learning, and 
specifically, deep learning approaches, has the potential to expedite this 
important component to the monitoring process by automating several 
tasks using imagery (Grijalva et al., 2023a; Grijalva et al., 2023b; Wang 
et al., 2023). Species detection and classification of organisms found in 
production sorghum fields are common tasks during standard scouting 
events  or  bouts.  Machine  learning  can  automate  these  tasks  with  the 
slightest  use  of  labor  and  time  (Chen  et  al.,  2021).  Many  traditional 
machine  learning  algorithms  have  been  used  to  classify  pests;  these 
include  the  Normal  Bayes  classifier  (a.k.a.,  Naïve  Bayes  classifier),  K

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each subset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating examples from those classes, while undersampling reduces the representation of majority classes by removing examples from them. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by collecting samples from various sources, conditions, and environments.

In the context provided, the authors mentioned using a dataset split ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. They also stated that they independently trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family. However, there is no information about whether any specific technique was employed to handle data bias during preprocessing.
