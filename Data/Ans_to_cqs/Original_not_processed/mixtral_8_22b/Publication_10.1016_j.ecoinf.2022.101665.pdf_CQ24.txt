mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

1.  Simple random sample. This corresponds to a simple random sample 
—without replacement— of the study area, where each location (i.e., 
grid  cell)  has  equal  inclusion  probability.  Note  that  by  nature,  a 
spatial simple random sample exhibits some degree of clustering and 
hence differentiation in sampling intensity. This sample was added 
as a reference case, and it was analysed the same way as the other 
samples.  

2.  Systematic random sample. This refers to sampling on a regular grid 
producing equal density over the study area (cf. Su et al., 2020). The 
grid  nodes  were  obtained  by  randomly  shifting  an  initial  square 
sampling grid that was spaced so as to achieve the desired sample 
size  (here  5000).  Next,  shifts  in  x  and  y  directions  were  applied, 
where the shifts were sampled from a uniform distribution between

Fig.  3  shows  example  maps  of  AGB  predictions  made  by  random 
forest  models  trained  on  samples  as  per  four  of  the  five  designs 
compared in this study. At first sight, the maps (a-c) are very similar to 
the proxy of exhaustive ground truth provided in Fig. 1(a) but closer 
inspection reveals some dissimilarities. Perhaps the most apparent dif-
ference is a reduction of the largest AGB values along Europe’s mountain 
ranges in Fig. 3(c). The latter map shows predictions based on a strongly 
clustered  sample  whose  locations  are  shown  in  Fig.  2(f).  It  can  be 
observed that this sample had few sampling sites in the high biomass 
areas, which may partly explain the observed tendency. The predictions 
in Fig. 3(d) differ considerably from those in Fig. 3(a-c). These are based 
on the strongly clustered, gapped sample shown in Fig. 2(h) which fails 
to cover the major part of the study area including the regions with large

Fig. 2. Examples of studied spatial samples. (a-b) simple random samples; (c) systematic random sample; (d-e) moderately clustered samples; (f-g) strongly clustered 
samples; (h-i) strongly clustered, gapped samples. Except for the systematic sample (c), the sample size always amounted to 5000. The systematic sample had an 
expected size of 5000 but realized samples varied in size between 4998 and 5056.

The text does not provide direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses related concepts in machine learning, specifically addressing limited data availability and evaluation of predictive models.

In machine learning, when data is abundant, a common approach is to split the dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for fitting the models, the validation set is used to estimate prediction errors for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used for assessing the accuracy of the final model.

When data availability is limited, setting aside a test set might not be feasible. In such cases, resampling methods like cross-validation or bootstrapping are used. Cross-validation involves partitioning the original sample into subsamples, using one subsample for training and another for validation, repeating the process multiple times, and averaging the results. Bootstrapping involves creating multiple datasets by drawing observations with replacement from the original dataset, then aggregating the results across these datasets.

These techniques help manage variability due to randomness in the data and improve the robustness of the model. While they do not directly address managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as controlling the random seed value, they offer insights into how to deal with uncertainty and variability in machine learning tasks.
