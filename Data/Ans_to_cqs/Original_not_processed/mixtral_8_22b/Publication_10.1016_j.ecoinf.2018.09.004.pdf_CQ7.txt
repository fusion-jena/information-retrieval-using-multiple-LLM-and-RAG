Cross-validation is an iterative method for calculating the expected
value of a particular measure. It splits the dataset into K equally-sized
parts that are called folds. In each iteration, diﬀerent (K − 1)-folds are
used for training and the remaining fold for testing. The overall mea-
sure of its performance is the average of the measures of the individual
iterations. The above method guarantees that every instance will be
used both for training and testing. There is an alternative of cross-va-
lidation method called stratiﬁed cross-validation, where in each fold a
balanced number of instances for each class is selected. For our ex-
perimentation, we used stratiﬁed cross-validation with K = 10 folds.

4. Experiments

In this section, we perform two experiments. First, we are trying to
predict the existence of seagrass, and then its family. We are also in-
terested on which variables aﬀecting those predictions most.

4.1. Detecting seagrass

The ﬁnal step is to train and test the machine learning algorithms in
this dataset for 5-class classiﬁcation. Stratiﬁed cross-validation was
used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure. This dataset
is not balanced as can be seen in Table 1. Cymodocea is the dominant
class that constitutes the 75% of the dataset. Thus, Accuracy may not be
a suitable measure, because it measures how many correct predictions
were made overall, and if we predict all the test examples as cymo-
docea, then Accuracy would be close to 75% without even predicting
another class. This is clearly a problem because many machine learning
algorithms are designed to maximize overall Accuracy, with the ex-
ception of the tree-based algorithms. So, we resort to the F-measure; the
algorithms are ranked based on it.

Typically, the input dataset is split into two disjoint subsets, the
training and the testing set. The training set is used to learn the model,
while the test set is used to measure a performance measure. But how
conﬁdent can we be about the classiﬁcation performance? The results
may be due to accidental characteristics of the speciﬁc partitioning. For
example, the test set may happen to include points that are easy to be
categorized, with the result that the categorizer yields good perfor-
mance. Consequently, the choice of a ﬁxed, predeﬁned partitioning of
the dataset may not be the best way for evaluating classiﬁers.

(in terms of comparative presence–absence item counts), Accuracy is a
suitable measure for model performance evaluation. Nevertheless, all
applied algorithms are ranked based on the F-measure (from worst to
best), for reasons to be explained in Section 4.1.1 below.

Helpful Answer:

For splitting the data for deep learning model training, one commonly used technique is cross-validation. Cross-validation is an iterative method for calculating the expected value of a particular measure. It splits the dataset into K equally-sized parts, known as folds. In each iteration, different (K - 1)-folds are used for training, while the remaining fold is used for testing. The overall measure of its performance is the average of the measures of the individual iterations. This ensures that every instance will be used both for training and testing. A variant of cross-validation is stratified cross-validation, where in each fold, a balanced number of instances for each class is selected.

When performing binary classification tasks, accuracy is often used as a suitable measure for model performance evaluation. However, when dealing with imbalanced datasets, accuracy might not be the best metric since it only considers the correctly predicted samples out of the total samples. Therefore, other metrics such as precision, recall, or F-measure should be considered instead. These metrics take into account the true positives, false negatives, and false positives, providing a more comprehensive view of the model's performance.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically involve techniques like cross-validation or stratified cross-validation. When choosing the appropriate performance metric, factors such as dataset balance and the specific requirements of the task must be taken into consideration.
