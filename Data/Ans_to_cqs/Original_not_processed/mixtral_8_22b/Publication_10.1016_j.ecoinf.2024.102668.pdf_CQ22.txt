Appendix C. Site: S2 

C.1. Coherence 

Fig. C.12 presents the results of applying the coherence measure to the data from site S2. In the top panel, note how in the frequency range of 7-8 
kHz, the frequency responses are not comparable as they do not exceed the established threshold. This is due to the behavior change exhibited by the 
SM4 recorder at this frequency range, which can be observed in the bottom panel of Fig. C.12. In addition, the frequency response at this site is not 
comparable over 12 kHz, which is consistent with the other sites.

bility—differences between recording devices. By reducing device bias, 
we enhance the applicability of these indices for broader comparative 
analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning 
and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies 
regardless of the recording device used (Purwins et al., 2019).

Our proof-of-principle example demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
comprehensive  processing  pipeline  in  mitigating  device  biases  in  site 
comparisons  using  ecoacoustic  indices  (EAI).  Although  EAIs  are  not 
typically  used  for  site  comparisons  due  to  contradictory  correlations 
with biological variables across different study sites (Bradfer-Lawrence 
et  al.,  2019a),  our  methodology  addresses  one  of  the  previously  un-
considered sources of variability that could explain these contradictions, 
such  as  differences  between  recording  devices.  By  eliminating  device 
bias, we expand the applicability of EAI to emerging fields like machine 
learning  and  deep  learning,  which  require  consistent  feature  spaces 
regardless of the recording device used.

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. ROC AUC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve, which measures the area under the curve plotted based on True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate. Confusion Matrix provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. It shows the number of correctly classified instances, misclassified instances, false negatives, and false positives.
