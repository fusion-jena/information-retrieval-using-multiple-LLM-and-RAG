Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The batch size was 32, and the early stopping procedure was used to 
avoid over-fitting. The patience parameter, which controls the number 
of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, was set to 10. 
Each network, with a particular architecture and considering a specific 
substratum characterization, was trained and executed three times, each 
time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters 
and with a different data fold. As already mentioned, the results shown 
in  the  next  section  are  averages  of  those  three  executions.  Data 
augmentation was applied to all extracted patches: a 90∘  rotation and 
vertical and horizontal flips. 

4.4. Performance metrics

Appendix A. Network architectures 

The network architectures of the models evaluated in the experiments are described in detail in Fig. 9. The light green areas in that figure represent 
feature extractor modules based on the different architectures, i.e., VGG, ResNet, and Xception. The orange area represents the architecture of the 
classifier module, to which the outputs of each feature extractor are submitted.

Each rectangle indicates the operations performed at a block of layers. Conv and SConv stand for regular convolution and depth-wise separable 
convolution, respectively. The values that follow such operations indicate the number of filters, filter size, stride, and dilation rate. Regarding the 
maxpooling operation, the values correspond to the kernel dimension and stride. Dropout refers to the number of neurons randomly turned off during 
each training inference. The number of neurons in the dense layer of the classifier module corresponds to the number of classes in the dataset. 

All architectures were modified mainly in the block of fully connected layers, where we opted to use just the output layer after the feature extractor 
instead of two fully connected layers. Additionally, residual blocks were used at the architectures’ stems rather than in the full feature extractor. All 
those modifications were experimentally determined.

3.2. ResNet 

Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et al. (2016), aimed at 
improving convergence issues during the training of very deep network 
architectures. ResNet is a deep learning model that aims to alleviate two 
main  problems  in  training  neural  networks.  The  first  problem  is  the 
vanishing  gradient,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  optimize  the  model 
during training. The second is the degradation problem, which occurs 
when  adding  more  layers  to  a  deep  neural  network  leads  to  greater 
training errors. ResNet solved those problems by using residual learning 
blocks between layers of the network, allowing for better optimization 
and higher training accuracy.

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can infer some general steps that might have been taken due to common practices in machine learning projects. After training the model with a batch size of 32 and applying early stopping to prevent overfitting, the model could be saved or serialized into a file format like.h5 (HDF5) if using Keras/TensorFlow. This allows the model to be reused later without retraining. For platform selection, depending on the project requirements, the model could be deployed on various platforms such as cloud services (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), edge devices, or even mobile applications. But again, these are assumptions based on typical ML workflows, not explicit details from the provided context.
