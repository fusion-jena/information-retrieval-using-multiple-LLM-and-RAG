Regarding  the  generated  indices,  recent  studies  on  this  topic  ach-
ieved certain results while dealing solely with the most common RGB 
model for colour representation (Nelis et al., 2020). This study, how-
ever, presents the potential of other colour spaces, since indices derived 
by Rasp2SPAD covered HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) and YUV (Y, Cb, 
Cr) colour space in addition to the RGB model. The conversion of initial 
DN representing the RGB channels according to the equations listed in 
Table 3 brought a new dimension of knowledge in terms of simple colour 
image  utilization for  plant status  assessment,  as  the blue-  Cb  and  red 
chroma component Cr were the most important parameters during SPAD 
value modelling. The YUV colour model, whose domain has digital re-
cord compression via chroma subsampling (Choudhury, 2014), has also 
been in the field of agriculture and has used for segmentation of pixels

In terms of the data quality, Rasp2SPAD demonstrated to be able to 
provide a complex dataset by capturing and processing the simple colour 
image as a result of the evaluation procedure on the winter rapeseed. In 
addition to the extraction of DN for RGB channels, 19 other indices were 
calculated. These parameters were all tested on their relationship to the 
SPAD value gained by the SPAD-502Plus handheld sensor. The corre-
logram (Fig. 6) provided an initial hint of more or less correlated indices 
with the six best performing NRI (r = (cid:0) 0.869), hue (r = 0.865), ExG-ExR

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that images are used in the process. The text mentions the use of color models such as RGB, HSB, and YUV, which are commonly used in image processing. Additionally, the context discusses the extraction of Digital Numbers (DN) for RGB channels and the calculation of various indices related to these channels. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
