Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

During training, the diffusion model is provided with a dataset
comprising trajectories of fixed length. Determining the appropriate
length of these trajectories is a non-trivial task, as it can significantly
impact the performance of the final model. To address this, we initially
plotted the histogram of the original trajectory lengths and extracted
statistics including the minimum, maximum, average, and median
lengths. The analysis revealed that the majority of trajectories have a
length of 13. Consequently, we established a standard trajectory length
of 13 for our model. After segmenting the trajectories into fixed lengths
of 13, we discard segments shorter than 6 detections. For segments with
6 to 12 detections, we replicate their data points until they reach the
required length of 13. Finally, we scale each coordinate of the fish
detection within the range of [(cid:0) 1,1].

Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder
model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events.
Throughout the training of MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network
reaches a plateau was used. The MLP was trained for several epochs with
various parameter configurations and regularization techniques,
including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss, in line with the proposed
method. As regularization techniques, weight decay, batch normaliza-
tion (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
were explored. In particular, batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy,
2015) was tested on each layer of the network separately and on all
layers simultaneously, with the best results achieved when applied to
the third layer. Dropout has been applied to the input layer, the hidden
layers, and all layers, yielding various results in combination with other

During the training of the MLP, Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) is used, as well as the scheduler which adjusts the learning rate
when the network reaches a plateau. For the training, various parameter
values and different regularization techniques were explored, with the
option of using either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017). In
detail, the learning rate was set to 0.00001 and 0.0001, batch sizes of 8,
16, 32, and 64 were tested, and weight decay was varied between
0.0001 and 0.001 with a dropout of 0.1. Additionally, Focal Loss (Lin
et al., 2017) introduce additional parameters to investigate: α and γ. The
former serves as a balancing factor, either as a fixed value for all classes
or as the inverse of each class frequency. The latter regulates the impact
of the scaling factor; specifically, when set to zero, Focal Loss is equiv-
alent to Cross-Entropy Loss. We experimented with α set as the inverse of

The MLP employed consists of four fully connected layers with the
size of 256, 128, 64, and 12, each comprising a linear layer followed by
PRelu as non-linearity. Only the third layer differs, as it is provided with
Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). During optimization,
Batch Normalization was also applied to other layers as well, but the
network performance was not as good. The network gets the input of size
512 consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model
and the last layer has 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this
layer is then used for predicting the event class, as each neuron corre-
sponds to one of the events. The values of the 12 neurons are then
compared to the real event ground truth through a loss, which serves to
update the model parameters and perform the training.

Helpful Answer: Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any specific detail about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Deployment could involve processes such as model serialization, where the model is saved in a format that can be loaded later for use, or platform selection, where a suitable environment is chosen to run the model, among others. However, without explicit details regarding these steps, I cannot provide a precise answer.
