Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

of fire risk maps that exhibit enhanced efficacy in fire-sensitive forest 
ecosystems  can  be  achieved  by  utilizing  diverse  remote  sensing  data 
characterized by high spatial resolution, particularly Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV) images incorporating multispectral bands. Additionally, 
employing  various  modeling  techniques  such  as  artificial  neural  net-
works, deep learning, and logistic regression can further contribute to 
refining these maps.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other particular framework was utilized. However, it is clear from the context that various modeling techniques, including deep learning, were applied to refine fire risk maps in forest ecosystems using diverse remote sensing data with high spatial resolution.

To summarize, while we do know that deep learning methods were employed in creating fire risk maps, there is no explicit mention of the exact frameworks used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
