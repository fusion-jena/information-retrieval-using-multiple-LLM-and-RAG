data  was  used  to  validate  model  predictions.  The  Area  Under  Curve 
(AUC)  evaluation  metric  and  True  Skill  Statistics  (TSS)  were  used  to 
assess  the  performance  of  model  predictions.  The  predictive  map  of 
current  and  future  areas  were  classified  into  unsuitable  (0–0.6)  and 
suitable  (0.6–1).  The  threshold  value  of  0.6  was  derived  from  equal 
training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current 
prediction was compared to future predictions to estimate change over 
time. The predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, 
lowland  terrestrial,  upland  epiphyte,  upland  terrestrial)  during  three 
time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) 
using SSP 5–8.5) were compared in order to identify the potential impact 
of  climate  change  and  land  cover  change  on  suitable  areas  for  each 
group. Predicted suitable areas and elevation ranges were used as spatial

An  ensemble  model  incorporating  Random  Forest  (RF)  (Breiman, 
2001)  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  (Noble  and  Street,  2006) 
components  was  used  to  predict  current  and  future  suitable  areas  of 
orchids under land cover and climate change. 80% of the data for each 
category (epiphyte lowland orchid, terrestrial lowland orchid, epiphyte 
upland  orchid,  and  terrestrial  upland  orchid)  were  used  to  build  the 
model. The R “dismo” and R “sdm” package were used to generate model 
predictions (Naimi and Araújo, 2016). The remaining 20% of the testing

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model serves a classification function. This is because the model is used to classify areas as either 'unsuitable' or'suitable' based on certain criteria. Specifically, the model uses an ensemble approach combining Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) components to predict current and future suitable areas for different groups of orchids under land cover and climate change scenarios. The model is trained with 80% of the data for each category of orchids and validated using metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS), which are commonly used for evaluating binary classification models. Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this study appears to be the classification of suitable habitats for various types of orchids under changing environmental conditions.
