Toolbox  by  MathWorks  (Beale  et  al.,  2018),  cuDNN  (Chetlur  et  al.,

2.  A CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance should be created on Google Cloud. Various choices are available by searching for ‘CUDA’ in the 
Google Cloud ‘Marketplace’. We recommend a VM named “Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97”, as it comes with the necessary drivers 
and compilers pre-installed. At the time of writing, this instance uses CUDA 11.6. Documentation is available if additional information about 
similar Google Cloud VMs is required.  

3.  The VM can be launched using the ‘Launch’ button on the aforementioned page, after which the required hardware specification of the VM must be 
selected. For most small projects, 16GB of memory and an SSD boot drive of 30GB should suffice. The number and type of GPUs can be selected at 
this stage.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any specific information regarding the location or availability of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. Therefore, without further details, it is impossible to determine where the data repository might be located, whether it is hosted on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or elsewhere.
