Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The papers mentioned in the given context discuss various applications of deep learning models in wildlife surveys and conservation efforts, particularly in Antarctica. However, not all of them explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in their respective pipelines. Here are some examples where the types of deep learning models are specified:

1. Le et al. (2022): This paper describes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies.

2. Moreni et al. (2023): Although this study does not directly focus on wildlife surveys, it provides insights into selecting pretrained neural network architectures for automated aerial animal detection. While they do not specify a particular type of deep learning model, they use mean Average Precision (mAP) as a metric to evaluate different architectures.

3. Peng et al. (2020): This work presents a modified version of the Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) for wild animal surveys using unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

In summary, based on the information available in the provided context, we can identify two instances of deep learning models being used in wildlife surveys: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a variant of the Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN).
