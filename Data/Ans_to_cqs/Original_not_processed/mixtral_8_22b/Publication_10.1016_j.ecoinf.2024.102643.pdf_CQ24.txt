differed  between  the  Euro-Siberian  and  Irano-Turanian  regions,  as 
damages to livestock and beehives and road accidents were significantly 
higher in the Euro-Siberian region (Table 1).

%Query
Query: "What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided sources directly address this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific strategy based on these sources.

In general, some common strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping to estimate model performance accurately. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency in results across different runs of the same model.
