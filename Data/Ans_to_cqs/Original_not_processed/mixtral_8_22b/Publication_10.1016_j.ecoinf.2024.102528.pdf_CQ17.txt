Continuous  bioacoustic  monitoring  is  an  emerging  opportunity  as  well  as  a  challenge,  allowing  detection  of 
cryptic species' activity while producing high computational demands. In this paper, we present an automated 
framework that allows the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended 
periods. The framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. We applied the framework to >80 
species; 20 species with the highest recall scores were selected for further analysis.

One  of  the  most  valuable  tools  developed  in  recent  years  is  deep 
learning models which have been used for the tasks mentioned above

Helpful Answer:
The papers cited do not provide specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines they describe. However, some common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to prevent overfitting. L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function based on the weights of the network, encouraging smaller weight values and simpler models. Early stopping ends the training process before convergence when performance on a validation set stops improving. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and speeding up training. These techniques can be combined or used individually depending on the requirements of the specific application.
