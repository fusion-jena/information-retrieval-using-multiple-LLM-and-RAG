The results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future 
LULC  analysis  performed  with  other  methodologies,  such  as  deep 
learning  CNN  (Jagannathan  and  Divya,  2021).  Going  forward,  the 
analysis  of  aerial  images  of  KNP  taken  about  every  two  years  deep 
learning methods will be most effective and useful to map land cover or 
more specifically woody cover. Integrating large-area historical datasets 
in  land-use  and  land-cover  analysis  can  serve  as  a  resource  to  better 
understanding  long-term  landscape  changes  and  support  ecological 
monitoring programs. The results of studies such as this one can be used 
to  better  protect  and  preserve  our  natural  heritage,  enable  effective 
management  strategies,  and  contribute  to  the  conservation  of  global 
biodiversity.

The supervised learning workflow adheres to the steps outlined in 
Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. However, as detailed in Section 2.3.2, we deviated 
by not generating 400 random points over the entire boundary. Instead, 
we used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide 
the placement of our sampling plots, from which we then collected the 
training and validation points (Fig. A.2). The creation of several small 
sampling plots within each vegetation type, instead of using one large 
area, also helped speed up the sampling process. Performing the data 
collection  within  the  sampling  plots  ensured  that  we  had  training/ 
validation  points  that  were  representative  of  the  diverse  vegetation 
within each boundary. To determine the size of the sampling plots, we 
first calculated 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, divided 
that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary

%Query
Query: "What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text does not contain any specific links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other version control system repositories. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately identify the requested code repository link.
