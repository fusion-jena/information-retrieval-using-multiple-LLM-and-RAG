There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

overfitting, and finally iii) let field experts evaluate the model with a 
completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. 
The model can be deployed if it passes these three phases successfully. 
These phases are outlined in Fig. 3. The obtained results as well as their 
evaluation  are  provided  in  the  following  section.  The  experimental 
design of data utilisation and data processing phases with their targeted 
objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEM‘s database. The 
viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases.

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the text, which discusses methods for detecting underwater man-made objects (MMOs) and specific types of surface marine MMOs, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for object detection or classification tasks. This assumption is further supported by the mention of a study by Han et al. (2022), who proposed a deep learning technique called LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify, and locate vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery. Therefore, without explicit information about the specific deep learning model discussed in the context, we can only speculate that its purpose could be related to object detection or classification tasks in the context of underwater or surface marine environments.
