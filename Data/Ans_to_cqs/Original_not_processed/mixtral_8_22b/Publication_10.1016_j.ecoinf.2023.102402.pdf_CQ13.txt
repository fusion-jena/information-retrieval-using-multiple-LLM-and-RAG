goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value (i. 
e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of 
models;  all  models  with  ΔAICc  <2  are  generally  considered  to  have 
substantial  support  (Muscarella  et  al.,  2014).  The  model  parameter 
settings with the lowest AICc values (ΔAICc = 0) for both H. guttulatus 
and H. hippocampus were chosen to establish the final Maxent models 
(ENMeval outputs in supplementary materials, Appendix 2).

(0–0.335),  medium 
formance  classes  were  considered:  poor 
(0.336–0.665), and good (0.666–1).

2.4. Model validation 

The model's performance was  evaluated using the Area Under the 
receiver-operator  Curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  values  range  from  0  to  1, 
where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction 
(Fielding and Bell, 1997). In addition to the AUC, the True Skill Statistics 
(TSS) was calculated. TSS values range between (cid:0) 1 and + 1. A TSS value 
of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted dis-
tributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random perfor-
mance  (Allouche  et  al.,  2006).  AUC  and  TSS  are  the  methods  most 
commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution 
model studies (e.g., Gaier and Resasco, 2023; Mondanaro et al., 2023; 
Song and Estes, 2023).

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Maxent models for establishing species distributions but does not provide details on any deep learning techniques or their associated hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
