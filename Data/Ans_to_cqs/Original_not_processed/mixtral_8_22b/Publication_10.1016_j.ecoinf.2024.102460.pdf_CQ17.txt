4.3.3. LSTM model 

The  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  model  is  a  common  deep 
learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data 
(Tang  et  al.,  2023).  Compared  with  traditional  machine  learning 
models, the LSTM model has better performance and ability to manage 
the  prediction  problem  of  time  series  data,  especially  the  long-term 
dependency  problem  and  multivariate  time  series  data,  and  has 
obvious  advantages  (Liu  et  al.,  2021;  Tang  et  al.,  2023;  Zhou  et  al., 
2023). Fig. 3 shows the prediction process of the LSTM model and the BP 
model.  This  study  compares  these  two  models  and  the  Markov  chain 
model.

Optimizing land allocation through a multiobjective programming 
(MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods can provide 
a reference for decision makers.

after the TIFS treatment, and the shrinkage rates of woodland, grassland 
and  water bodies  were reduced by 0.52%, 3.46%  and  3.76%, respec-
tively, compared to those in the EDP scenario; moreover, the expansion 
rate of built-up areas was reduced by 18.04% compared to that in the 
EDP scenario. At this point in the basin, the economic benefit, ESV and 
EC of the land system were 31,773.63, 5079.30 and 3563.04 (unit: 104 
CNY), respectively. In summary, future planning should focus on pro-
tecting  cropland  by  formulating  appropriate  policies  and  strictly 
adhering to protection strategies, coordinating the systematic manage-
ment  of  different  types  of  land,  improving  the  quality  of  vegetation 
cover  and  restoring  the  natural  ecological  environment.  On  the  one 
hand, there is an urgent need to improve the planning and construction 
of urban clusters to make efficient use of existing land in built-up areas

Spatial reconstruction and scenario simulation of historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change 
(LUCC) can help to reveal the historical background of land conversion and the spatial distribution of future land. 
Moreover, there is a close relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/cover and changes in 
different ecosystem services (ESs). Using this relationship to simulate future land use scenarios is important. In 
this study, an LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) was constructed based on a deep learning 
time  series  forecasting  model  (LSTM),  a  parallelized  urban  land  use  simulation  (PLUS)  model  and  a  fuzzy 
multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. The PLUS model was used to analyze the driving mechanism of land 
expansion and explore the land conversion pattern. In addition, three land conversion scenarios were established:

Helpful Answer:
Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization to new data. Two commonly used regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, it forces the network to spread out its weights across multiple features instead of relying heavily on specific ones. Dropout is typically applied after each layer except the output layer.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay or Ridge regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize both the original loss function and the sum of squared weights. As a result, the network tends to have smaller weights overall, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Both dropout and L2 regularization can be used together or separately depending on the requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. Other regularization methods include early stopping, L1 regularization (also called Lasso regression), and batch normalization. However, the context does not explicitly mention any other regularization methods besides dropout and L2 regularization.
