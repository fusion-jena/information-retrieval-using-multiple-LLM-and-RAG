are required to submit data to ESS-DIVE for long-term stewardship.

The practice of data publication to date had been modeled using the 
paper publication processes as a guide (Borgman, 2016; Silvello, 2018). 
Data producers are typically also the authors of the data publication and 
make decisions on how to package the data using a variety of consid-
erations, including: order of authors who need to be included, theme of 
the  data,  time  range  of  the  data,  type  of  data,  expected  usage  needs, 
project goals, sponsoring organization, and/or scale of the data. Once 
the data have been submitted to a repository with appropriate metadata 
describing  the  data,  they  are  ideally  reviewed  by  the  repository  and 
published (e.g., Kakalia et al., 2019; O’Brien et al., 2016). Typically, the 
repository  assigns  a  DOI  to  each  published  dataset  and  provides  an 
automated  citation  using  DOI  schema  metadata  fields  (e.g.,  authors, 
title,  publication  year,  publisher)  (Fenner  et  al.,  2019).  Another

like processing, cleaning, and curation of the data (the ESIP Research 
Object  Citation  Cluster  is  addressing  this  now).  The  importance  of 
acknowledging these roles increases when data are synthesized and/or 
transformed,  as  the integration  process requires  extensive intellectual 
effort.

Data papers are an emerging method of increasing the prestige and 
usability  of  a  data  package  or  set  of  data  packages  through  the  peer 
review process (Costello et al., 2013; Kratz and Strasser, 2015). A data 
paper usually provides information about a dataset (consisting of one or 
more data packages). The data paper can provide context and in-depth 
discussion  regarding  the  data,  including  how  and  why  they  were 
collected,  processed,  and  analyzed.  It  also  typically  provides  details 
regarding  formats,  measurement  method  limitations,  and  other  infor-
mation needed to understand the data. A data paper can also provide 
overview  statistics  and  plots  describing  the  data.  Some  journals  have 
requirements that can improve or hinder publication of data via the data 
paper  approach.  An  example  of  a  requirement  for  Nature’s  Scientific 
Data is that the data paper accompanies publication of new data (not

Helpful Answer: I apologize, but there doesn't seem to be any direct mention of postprocessing steps related to machine learning models such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, or confusion matrices within the given context. However, it does discuss some aspects of data management and publication which could potentially involve similar concepts. For instance, once data has been submitted to a repository, it may go through review and then be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), along with automated citations. This could be seen as somewhat analogous to the evaluation phase of a machine learning pipeline where various performance metrics might be calculated. Additionally, the concept of data papers, which provide detailed context and discussion around datasets, could be likened to the use of visualization tools like saliency maps to better understand the behavior of trained models. But again, please note that these are not explicit parallels drawn from the text itself.
