cles, autonomous vehicles, and surface vessels have been deployed for 
the  offshore  industries  and  deep-sea  archaeology,  ocean  engineering 
projects, rescue operations and environmental measurements for the last 
several  decades.  For  instance,  the  Argo  program,  an  international 
collaboration,  has  deployed  approximately  3900  instruments  in  the 
world's oceans to facilitate the collection of data for climatological and 
oceanographic studies. (Riser et al., 2016). Besides, artificial structures

directory by the proposed technique in this study, which is proposed as a 
future work in Section 6. Bespoke semi-supervised ML approaches (e.g., 
SelfMatch in (Xing et al., 2022a)) can be a good candidate for addressing 
this type of research question by extracting features from labelled data 
and comparing them with the features that are obtained from detected 
ISMMMOs based on the semantic information (e.g., (Xiao et al., 2022) 
and  a  feature/distance-based  matching  scheme  (e.g.,  (Xing  et  al., 
2022b)) considering various pose compositions (e.g., (Çalıs¸kan, 2023)). 
The methodology not only distinguishes ISMMMOs from the blank 
background (sea canvas with waves in many different shapes), but also

There  are  numerous  studies  in  the  literature  to  detect  underwater 
man-made  objects  (MMOs)  within  a  limited  region  of  interest  (RoI) 
using  underwater  imagery,  robots  or  sonography.  For  instance,  Abu 
et  al.  (Abu  and  Diamant,  2022)  proposes  a  contour-based  features 
analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environment 
considering that contours of MMOs' are supposed to be smoother than 
natural objects. There are a limited number of studies in the literature to 
detect specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine 
Learning  (ML)  and  Deep  Learning  (DL)  approaches  that  require  prior 
training in the marine ecosystem. For instance, Han et al. (Han et al., 
2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and 
locate  vessels  and  oil  platforms  based  on  remote  optical  imagery,  by 
which all other MMOs are excluded. There are no studies in the litera-

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of a publicly accessible data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in any of the cited references. Therefore, it would be best to contact the authors directly to request access to their datasets or code if they are willing to share it.
