tionally, our technique is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and from the baseline model we 
recorded  a  17.65%  increase  in  FPS,  28.55%  model  parameters  reduction,  and  50.92%  in  FLOPs  reduction. 
Furthermore, our model has a faster model loading time, which is critical for deployment in remote areas. This 
enables real-time species recognition on basic hardware, aiding conservation efforts through rapid analysis. The 
model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance.

3.1.1. Backbone network 

The YOLOv5s model, a standout in computer vision, excels in various 
applications with its convolutional layer backbone, adept at extracting 
high-level image features. This backbone, based on CSPDarknet53 and 
shown in Fig. 2(a), improves upon Darknet53 from YOLOv3 (Redmon 
and Farhadi, 2018) to ensure efficient information processing. This led 
to the reengineering of the YOLOv5s backbone (Fig. 2(b)), enhancing its 
efficiency and reducing computational demands. The modified model is 
both  versatile  and  lightweight,  blending  the  precision  of  computer 
vision with ecological research needs. Subsequent subsections detail the

of layers, t, while the overall network size is determined by the number 
of MBBlocks and the size of the input tensor. The structure of Mobile-

followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation, and a head layer, 
consisting of a global average pooling operation followed by a 1 × 1

Helpful Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is designed for real-time species recognition. This is supported by the statement mentioning a 17.65% increase in FPS (frames per second), which is crucial for real-time applications. Additionally, the model aims to balance efficiency with performance, suggesting that it may also focus on optimizing resource usage without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, references to other papers indicate that similar models have been used for tasks such as plant disease classification, wild animal detection, and wildlife conservation, implying that the discussed model might serve a related purpose. However, without explicit confirmation, one cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
