During the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K- 
fold cross-validation technique was implemented. Additionally, a four- 
fold  cross-validation  was  conducted  on  the  training  dataset,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set 
was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through strat-
ified sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served 
as  the  validation  set,  while  the  remaining  three  folds  constituted  the 
training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under 
sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set 
remained unchanged. The model underwent training using the balanced 
three-fold  training  dataset  for  a  specified  number  of  epochs  and  was 
subsequently  tested  on  the  validation  fold to  generate  predictions for 
that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct valida-

both  on-site  and  RS  datasets,  integrating  them  comprehensively  into 
both training and validation phases (Aptoula and Ariman, 2021; Escoto

NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels 
in tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand- 
Jadidi  et  al.,  2022).  Comprising  interconnected  nodes  (neurons)  ar-
ranged  in  layers,  NN  processes  and  transforms  input  data  to  produce 
desired  outputs  (Goodfellow  et  al.,  2016;  Niroumand-Jadidi  et  al., 
2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input layer, one or 
more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number 
of  neurons  in  the  input  layer  aligns  with  the  count  of  input  features, 
whereas  in  this study, only  wind  speed  is  considered. The number of 
neurons  in  the  output  layer  corresponds  to  the  number  of  outputs  or 
classes  (Hardesty,  2017).  An  essential  consideration  of  NN  design

Helpful Answer:
The text describes the use of a K-fold cross-validation technique during the validation phase of machine learning algorithms, specifically setting K to four. In this case, the feature set was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. Each fold served as the validation set, while the remaining three folds constituted the training set for model training. To address imbalances, random under sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, while the validation set remained unchanged.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training were:

1. Stratified Sampling: This method ensures that each fold contains approximately the same proportion of samples from each class as the original dataset. It helps maintain the balance between classes when splitting the data.

2. Four Mutually Exclusive Folds: The feature set was divided into four non-overlapping subsets, ensuring no overlap between the training and validation sets. This approach allows for more efficient use of available data and reduces overfitting by exposing the model to diverse subsets of the data.

3. Random Under Sampling (RUS): Applied to the training set to handle class imbalance issues. By reducing the majority class instances, RUS aims to create a more balanced distribution of classes within the training set.

These techniques help ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and provides accurate predictions across various scenarios.
