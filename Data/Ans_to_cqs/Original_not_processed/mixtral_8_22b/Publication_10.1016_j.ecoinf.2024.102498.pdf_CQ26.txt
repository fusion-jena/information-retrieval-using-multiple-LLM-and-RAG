initially challenging due to limited access to the study area, time con-
straints,  and  the  complexity  of  different  classes.  To  address  this,  15 
apprentices were trained, and high-resolution images from Google Earth 
were utilized to collect appropriate labels. Two experts further reviewed 
the collected labels to ensure quality and accuracy.

GTB: The next algorithm used in this study is GTB, which sequen-
tially improves its classification performance. This model is an ensemble 
method  that  builds  trees  sequentially,  with  each  tree  attempting  to 
correct the weakness of the previous tree (Georganos et al., 2018). The 
execution of this model demands high computational power. This lim-
itation allowed for a maximum of 20 trees in the model for this research. 
Like RF, GTB can handle datasets with various features, and combining 
differently weighted trees prevents overfitting (Ouma et al., 2022).

An alternative approach to enhancing the accuracy of LULC maps is 
to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques operate patch- 
wise,  where  each  patch  incorporates  sophisticated  features  extracted 
from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns 
effectively.  Particularly,  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are 
highly  effective  for  LULC  classification.  These  models  automatically

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that high-resolution images from Google Earth were utilized to collect appropriate labels, and two experts further reviewed the collected labels to ensure quality and accuracy. In general, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources or locations to reduce bias caused by using data from only one source or location.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine which technique was specifically used in this case. However, collecting appropriate labels and reviewing them by experts could potentially help mitigate any biases introduced during data collection. Additionally, utilizing high-resolution images may also contribute to reducing potential biases related to image resolution or quality.
