found in the Data Availability section. The questionnaire included also 
details  on  sightingh  sites  such  as  habitat  features  and  number  of 
encountered  specimens,  and  percentages  on  the  total  number  of  re-
sponses were computed for each of these values.

To further assess the accuracy of our seahorse models, we created an 
independent  dataset  using  H.  guttulatus  and  H.  hippocampus'  presence 
records obtained from widely used open access biodiversity databases 
such  as  Global  Biodiversity  Information  Facility  (https://www.gbif. 
org/,  GBIF,  2022a,  2022b),  Ocean  Biodiversity  Information  System 
(OBIS,  https://obis.org/),  INaturalist  (https://www.inaturalist.org/), 
AquaMaps  (https://www.aquamaps.org/,  Kaschner  et  al.,  2007),  and 
from  literature  such  as  Zhang  and  Vincent  (2018)  to  achieve  model 
validation (e.g., Konowalik and Nosol, 2021; Westwood et al., 2020). 
The maps of all H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus' presence records ob-
tained from the open access biodiversity database are available in the 
supplementary materials (Figs. S3 and S4). We calculated the distance 
between all the occurrences in the above-mentioned dataset and their

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The authors do not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, they provide a list of sources from which they obtained presence records for H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus, including Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), iNaturalist, AquaMaps, and literature such as Zhang and Vincent (2018). They also state that further details on how to obtain their presence data can be found in the Data Availability section. Therefore, it is likely that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available through one or more of these sources. To confirm this, readers should refer to the Data Availability section of the paper.
