2.4. Data pre-processing 

2.2. Convolutional neural networks 

The  idea  behind  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  was  first 

As mentioned in the previous sections, the data is first split up into 
several  larger  blocks,  depending  on  coordinates,  with  the  purpose  to 
cross validate the model. These blocks are then split into many smaller 
areas of 80 × 80 pixels, due to limitations in the available amount of

2.5. Data post-processing 

Some post-processing is required to transform the result of the CNN 
into an easy accessible GIS-resource. This is primarily done to produce 
and refine the material covering southern Sweden, as well as making it 
easily  accessible  for  further  analyses.  This  process  consists  of  several 
steps. In the first step, the pixel predictions from the CNN are rounded, 

so all predictions with predicted value larger than 0.5 are considered as 
wetlands  and  all  predictions  below  are  non-wetlands.  This  creates  a 
raster over the whole map, where each pixel is either deemed to be part 
of a wetland or not. The next step is to convert this raster representation 
into a vector representation, to enable further analyses. This conversion 
is  also  conducted  to  minimise  storage  space  and  making  it  easier  to 
distribute.

Since the collection and annotation of data for the training of models, 
as  the  one  in  this  paper,  is  a  labour-intensive  process,  it  would  be 
valuable  to  perform  such  profound  investigations  and  quantify  the 
amount of data that may be needed. Another way forward, which avoids 
the labour intense labelling, would be to look for already annotated data 
that have been used for other purposes and then use that data to build AI 
models. One technique, which needs to be further investigated, in order 
to facilitate the collected data better, is to generate additional synthet-
ical  samples  from the  annotated  dataset, using  generative  adversarial 
models,  such  as  in  the  presented  work  by  Fang  et  al.  (2019)  and  Li 
(2019). In such approaches, several new samples are created in a real-
istic  way,  adding  more  variation  and  more  samples  to  the  original 
dataset. Hence, a small dataset can be extended with samples that are

Fig. 4. An excerpt of the map is shown in (a). The areas that are annotated as wetlands, produced by a human, is coloured with blue and shown in (c). The cor-
responding annotation that is produced by a CNN, which has not seen this part of the map during training, is shown in (d). The similarities and differences between 
these two annotations are shown in (b). Here the areas for which the human and the CNN annotations are the same are displayed in green. The areas where the CNN 
annotate the land as wetland but the human did not (false positives) is displayed in pink. Finally, the areas that the humans annotated as wetland but, the CNN did 
not recognise as such (false negatives) are displayed in orange. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web 
version of this article.)

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the collection and annotation of data for training models is labor-intensive, suggesting that manual processes like surveys or expert labeling might be involved. Additionally, the authors discuss generating synthetic samples from existing annotated datasets using techniques like generative adversarial models. While these details do not directly address the query regarding data collection methods, they imply that both manually labeled data and publicly available datasets could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline.
