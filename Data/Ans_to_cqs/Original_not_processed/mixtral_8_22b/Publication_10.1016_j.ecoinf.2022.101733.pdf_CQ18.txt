according to a 60%–40% ratio. Table 6 presents the details about the 
total number of samples, the training, and the validation samples. The 
distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. It is worthy to note that 
after selecting the samples, we checked all the samples carefully and as 
we see in Fig. 8 (as an example); surprisingly, no mis-collected samples 
were detected in the automatically collected samples.

matic  selection  + human  post-revision).  As  citrus  orchards  have  a 
relatively regular geometric shape and spatial patterns, this information 
can be exerted to the classification by the human supervisor as well. A 
few points (about 40 samples) are also collected in field surveying which 
is used for visual assessment of classification performance. Afterward, 
each category of samples (citrus and non-citrus) is randomly split up into 
two groups of training and validation in a 60%–40% ratio, respectively. 
Totally,  we  have  “citrus-training”,  “citrus-validation”,  “non-citrus- 
training”,  and  “non-citrus-validation”  collections.  Of  the  two  defined 
classes, the “citrus” class includes oranges and mandarin orchards (the 
appearance of both is similar). The “non-citrus”  class encompasses all

method has its own pros and cons. The ability to collect large numbers of 
samples  in  a  very  short  time  is  one  of  the  major  advantages  of  this 
method. On the other hand, as its cons, we can mention that a few points 
may be collected incorrectly, and the human expert corrects them in the 
post-supervision step.

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that after collecting the samples, they were divided into training and validation sets with a 60%-40% ratio, respectively. This suggests that the authors might have used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the text states that a few points were collected through field surveying for visual assessment of classification performance, indicating that qualitative evaluation methods could have been employed as well. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact monitoring strategy was utilized.
