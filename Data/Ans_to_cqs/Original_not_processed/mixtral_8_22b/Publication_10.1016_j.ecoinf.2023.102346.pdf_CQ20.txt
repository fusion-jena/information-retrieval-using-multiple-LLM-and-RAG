Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

The prediction power with machine learning algorithms was tested 
with the package “sdm”  (Naimi and Araújo, 2016), “dismo”  (Hijmans 
et al., 2015), “bioclim” (Booth et al., 2014), and the ensemble modeling 
approach  implemented  in  “biomod2”  (Thuiller  et  al.,  2009;  2014). 
Model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values 
were extracted using “shiny” packages (Chang et al., 2023) in RStudio 
(RStudio Team, 2020).

importance,  and  regularized  training  gain  for  each  variable.  Here,  a 
variable  with  highest  regularized  training  gain  is  indicating  that  this 
variable  has  the  most  useful  information  on  its  own  when  used  in 
isolation. Model sensitivity and accuracy for habitat suitability were also 
checked  with  the  AUC  values.  Graphical  representation  of  MAXENT 
models were produced in QGIS Desktop v 3.24.2 (QGIS Development 
Team, 2022).

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer: The given context does not provide any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be determined which hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs were utilized for training the deep learning models based solely on the provided context.
