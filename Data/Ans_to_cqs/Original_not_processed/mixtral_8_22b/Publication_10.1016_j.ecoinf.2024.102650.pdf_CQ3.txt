Tweets are usually short texts with such characteristics as sparsity, 
real-time nature, and irregularity. These features increase the difficulty 
of text processing (Edwards et al., 2022; Garg and Kumar, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2021) and require data cleaning to support subsequent analyses. 
Data cleaning includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. The 
former was used to filter out unnecessary symbols and noise, such as 
notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, stop words, 
and repeated texts on websites. User-generated text that deviated from 
the  theme  was  also  filtered  out  through  a  manual  review.  The  latter 
involved dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into 
meaningful  words,  which  is  a  key  technology  in  text  analyses  (Tian 
et al., 2021). We used Python’s Jieba Library for Chinese text segmen-
tation and a lexical analysis and included location, time, and organiza-
tional nouns.

Machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word 
segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text 
portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. Among 
machine  learning  models,  the  enhanced  representation  through 
knowledge  integration  (ERNIE)  model  achieved  significant  results  in 
previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order 
features from massive amounts of data (Sun et al., 2019). The ERNIE 
model  directly  models  prior  semantic  knowledge  units,  thereby 
enhancing model semantic representation (Wang et al., 2020). Test re-
sults for various Chinese tasks showed that the model performed better 
than  the  bidirectional  encoder  representations  from  the  transformer 
model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). At the International 
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020, the ERNIE model earned first 
place  for  a  mixed-language  emotional  analysis  task.  Detailed  de-

processing instructions can be found in Text S1. The final available data 
elements totaled 6802.

2.2.1. Latent Dirichlet allocation 

LDA—  proposed  by  Blei  et  al.  (2003)—is  a  topic  model  for  text 
generation based on natural language processing. The basic idea is that 
any text (in this study, microblog tweets) is composed of multiple topics 
with a polynomial distribution and each topic is composed of multiple 
words  with  a  polynomial  distribution.  By  analyzing  the  polynomial 
distribution of words for each topic, similar topics are aggregated into a 
topic category, and topic classification of the text is achieved (Tautorat 
et al., 2023). The advantage of LDA is its unsupervised nature, which 
means that the input corpus does not require labeled data, making it an 
ideal technique for topic modeling when labeled topics are not available 
and the quantity of input texts is large (Palanichamy et al., 2021; Sun 
and Yin, 2017).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that machine learning methods require text preprocessing, including word segmentation and stop word removal, followed by selecting a portion of text to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. This suggests that emotion labeling might have been employed as part of their data annotation process. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding other annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, we cannot definitively state what specific data annotation techniques were utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
