3.2.3. Custom D-CNN: CoralNet

We create a custom D-CNN named as CoralNet for the extraction of the spatial features.
CoralNet has thirteen layers in which three layers are convolutional layers (Conv2D), two
max-pooling (MaxPooling2D) layers, two dense layers, one ﬂatten layer, three activation
layers. The input layer size is kept at 227 × 227 × 3. Two activation layers have rectiﬁed
linear unit (ReLU) as activation function while the last activation layer uses softmax as
activation function. Features are extracted with Conv2D layers and the feature vector is
extracted at the last layer. The training options used for training CoralNet are summarized
in Table 1. The simpliﬁed architecture of the CoralNet is shown in Figure 6.

Similarly, in [8] hyper-spectral bottom index imagery is used for bottom-type classiﬁca-
tion in coral reef areas. The drawback of this technique is the need for an enormous number
of samples in the dataset for achieving higher accuracy. In [9], they proposed a method
of deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 for corresponding coral classiﬁcation that
needs a massive dataset for better accuracy.

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that a custom D-CNN named CoralNet was created for extracting spatial features from images. However, it does not mention any specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
