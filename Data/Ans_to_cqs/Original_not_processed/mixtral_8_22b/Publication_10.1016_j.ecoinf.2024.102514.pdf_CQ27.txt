Fig. 9 presents the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms. The 
majority of performance indicators were found to be higher during the 
training period; however, during the testing period, model performance 
was shown to have greatly improved, which may be due to the under-
fitting problem (Table S4 - supplementary data) (Wang et al., 2022). In 

addition,  the  lowest  prediction  errors  during  the  training  and  testing 
periods belong to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM (Fig. 9).

2.4.2. Data splitting 

The  WQ indicator  data  was  divided  into  training  and  testing  data 
sets. In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets 
are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively (Sajib 
et al., 2023). In this study, we adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting 
the training and testing datasets. A total of 20 and 10 random sample 
locations  were  selected  for  the  purposes  of  training  and  testing, 
respectively. A similar number or fewer sample locations were utilized 
in various previous research studies to train and test the data set (Bui

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details about model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context how the trained deep learning model was deployed.
