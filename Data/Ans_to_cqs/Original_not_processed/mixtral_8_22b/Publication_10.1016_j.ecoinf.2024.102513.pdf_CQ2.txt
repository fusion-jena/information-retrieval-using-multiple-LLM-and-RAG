Based on the architecture of the convolutional neural network pre-
sented in the 8, its main elements include the input layer, convolutional 
layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. The raster 
bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack 
of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each 

containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a 
multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spec-
tral channel. This layer allows the model to process and utilize spectral 
information  from  images  for  LULC  classification.  The  input  layer  re-
ceives  input  data from  the  raster  bands  stack  and  passes  them to  the 
subsequent layers of the network. It does not perform any computations 
and serves solely to transmit data further through the network.

of deep learning, a neural network was meticulously trained using these 
datasets.  This  training  process  was  pivotal  in  developing  a  classifier 
capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their 
spectral signatures.

The  main  idea  behind  convolutional  neural  networks involves  the 
utilization  of  convolutions  and  pooling  to  process  input  images  (Al- 
Saffar et al., 2017). Each layer consists of a set of filters (kernels) that 
slide over the image, performing convolution operations. 

Mathematically,  convolution  is  defined  as  follows  (Wiatowski  and 
B¨olcskei,  2017):  let's  consider  an  input  image  X  with  dimensions  of 
WxHxD, where W and H are the width and height of the image, and D is 
the number of channels (e.g., 3 for the Landsat-8 stack of visible color 
range). Let's have a filter with dimensions of F x F x D, where F is the 
filter  size.  Convolution  of  the  filter  with  the  image  is  performed  by 
moving the filter over the image with a step size S and calculating the 
element-wise product and summation: 

Convolution(X, filter) =

∑( ∑( ∑

(X(i, j, k)*filter(i, j, k) )

) )

Helpful Answer:
In this case, the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. Specifically, it utilizes a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, which contain information about different wavelengths. These rasters form a multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spectral channel. This input layer receives input data from the raster bands stack and passes them to subsequent layers of the network. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite imagery.
