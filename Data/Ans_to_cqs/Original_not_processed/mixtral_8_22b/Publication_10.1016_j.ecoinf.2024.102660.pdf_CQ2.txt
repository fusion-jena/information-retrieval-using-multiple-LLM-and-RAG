files to a size of 256 × 256 pixels. This cropping process resulted in a 
total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for 
training  the  deep  neural  network,  176  image  pairs  for  validating  the 
model  accuracy  during  the  training  phase,  and  356  image  pairs  for 
testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

network by enhancing the UNet convolutional neural network. The Convolutional Block Attention Module was 
integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network, we also refined the convolutional blocks 
to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. To mitigate overfitting, the 
residual structures were incorporated and the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced. 
The Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving metrics with an Accuracy 
of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%. These results underscore the precision of our proposed 
method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating 
water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

sun glint, this study reduces the number of 3 × 3 convolutional kernels 
in the convolutional block from 64 to 32, a measure taken to mitigate 
overfitting.  Additionally,  a  residual  structure  is  incorporated  into  the 
ResConv block based on the ResNet network (He et al., 2016). This in-
volves a series of operations: 3 × 3 convolution, batch normalization 
(BN),  rectified  linear  unit  (RELU)  activation  function,  followed  by 
another  3  × 3  convolution,  BN,  and  element-wise  addition  with  the 
output  of  the  initial  3  × 3  convolution.  Subsequently,  the  resulting 
feature map undergoes a secondary RELU activation function to obtain 
the convolutional feature results. Fig. 3(c) shows the Upsample block, 
responsible for restoring the feature map’s size to twice its original di-
mensions, comprising consecutive upsample, 3 × 3 convolution, BN, and 
RELU activation function operations.

5. Conclusion 

The presence of water sun glint influences the spectral and textural 
characteristics of the UAV-acquired images, achieving precise detection 
of  water  sun  glint  is  essential  to  mitigate  its impact  and  improve  the 
overall  usability of  the  data.  We proposed  the Res_AUNet  network  to 
identify water sun glint regions in water area images collected by UAV. 
In  the  Res_AUNet  network,  we  added  the  CBAM  mechanism  at  the 
feature connections of the encoding and decoding parts to extract water 
sun glint features in both spectral and spatial domains, while ignoring 
other irrelevant information. Additionally, we improved the network’s 
convolutional  kernel  module  by  introducing  residual  structures  and 
reducing  the  number  of  convolutional  kernels  to  half  of  the  original 
UNet network, aiming to mitigate overfitting. These two improvements

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the study uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) water images for detecting water sun glint. The images are preprocessed and resized to a dimension of 256 x 256 pixels before being fed into the deep neural network. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
