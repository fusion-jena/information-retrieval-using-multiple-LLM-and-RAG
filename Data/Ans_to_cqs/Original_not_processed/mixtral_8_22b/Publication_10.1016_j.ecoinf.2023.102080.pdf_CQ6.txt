2. We introduce a two-step “embedded” covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the pre-
dictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models fitted in a context of high-dimensional 
candidate covariate space. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with 
three  model-specific  embedded  regularization  techniques  (Step  B),  including  generalized  linear 
model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and 
guided regularized random forest.

By combining a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific 
embedded regularization techniques, we demonstrated the abilities of 
the  two-step  “embedded”  covariate  selection  procedure  to  deliver  ac-
curate  and  parsimonious  SDMs.  Implemented  and  streamlined  in  the 
covsel R package, it offers an open and evolutive ready-to-use tool for 
automated covariate selection that was missing in the SDM field, with 
the potential to become the new standard by which to perform this step. 
Capable of dealing with covariate sets ranging from several tens to 
thousands of candidates, the covsel R package can be easily run on any 
local computer or high-performance computing cluster. Despite being 
available  for  several  decades  (Hoerl  and  Kennard,  1970;  Saeys  et  al., 
2007; Tibshirani, 1996), embedding techniques have been little used in 
SDM  studies.  One  of  their  main  benefits  compared  to  the  more

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide information about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing predictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models. This procedure involves a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) and three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (Step B). These techniques include generalized linear model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and guided regularized random forest.

Before applying these techniques, the data is processed based on spatial resolution (i.e., windows of 100-m, 500-m, or 1-km radii), category level (e.g., within thematic covariate categories), and using all remainders. Additionally, parameters like algorithms, target number of covariates, maximum possible number of covariates, number of cores for parallel operations, correlation coefficient threshold, category-level covariate names, and variable-level names are defined.

However, specific preprocessing steps related to normalization, scaling, or cleaning typically applied before training a deep learning model are not mentioned in the given context.
