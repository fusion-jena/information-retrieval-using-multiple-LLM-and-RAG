Appendix F for R code that uses FRAMES metadata to automate this).
Alternatively, FATES hydrodynamic predictions can be bench-
marked by tracking sub-hourly extremes like daily maximum sap ﬂow,
the timing of which is not known a priori, over periods of gradual de-
clines in water availability, which occurred during the ENSO mea-

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducible results, using techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained on different random initializations. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information.
