mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evalua-
tion are often not available and therefore alternative methods have been 
proposed.  In  machine  learning,  if  data  are  abundant,  a  common 
approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modelling into 
three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set (Hastie et al., 
2009,  Chapter  7).  The  training  set  is  used  for  fitting  the  models,  the 
validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and 
hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the ac-
curacy of the final model. This paper addresses this latter testing phase, 
with the specific aim to assess the accuracy of a thematic map produced 
by a calibrated statistical prediction method. Data availability is often 
limited  so that setting  aside a  test set  cannot always be afforded and 
therefore resampling methods are used (Hastie et al., 2009; Steele et al.,

In the two model-based methods (methods 4 and 5), the map accu-
racy metrics are computed from simulated residuals at the N nodes of the 
grid covering the entire study area. For each simulation, estimates of 
RMSE and MEC were computed by Eqs. (9) and (10):

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses methods for evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by calibrated statistical prediction methods when data availability is limited. These methods include using a training set for fitting models, a validation set for estimating prediction errors and hyperparameter tuning, and a test set for assessing the accuracy of the final model. When data availability is scarce, resampling methods like cross-validation can be employed. Additionally, the text mentions two model-based methods for computing map accuracy metrics from simulated residuals.
