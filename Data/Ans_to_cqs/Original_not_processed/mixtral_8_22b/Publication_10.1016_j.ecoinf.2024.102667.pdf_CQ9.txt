Question: %INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query in less than 400 words. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

%Query
Query: "Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The information regarding the availability of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository is available from the provided sources. It could potentially be found in one of the repositories listed in the query such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without further information, a definitive answer cannot be provided.
