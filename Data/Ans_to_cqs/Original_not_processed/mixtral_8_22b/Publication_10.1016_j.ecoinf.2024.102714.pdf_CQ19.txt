the mapping, thus reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

For the ML model, training and testing datasets were generated
through reference to existing field datasets and VHR images (Section
2.4.3, Table 2). Areas dominated by the target communities were digi-
tised as polygons and all pixels contained were extracted. These poly-
gons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with ~30% of
pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation. Splitting
polygons rather than pixels minimises the effect of spatial autocorrela-
tion on model accuracies (Karasiak et al., 2022). We used a python
implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) to
classify the VTs, given optimised random trees can be developed
whereby each new tree learns from the errors of those previous. As input
to the ML algorithm, the seasonal vegetation index composites from S2,
backscatter composites from S1, elevation and slope were used, totalling
up to 54 features (Appendix-A). The compositing periods were chosen

Helpful Answer:
The text does not provide explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the machine learning model. However, it mentions using a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), which suggests that the model might have been built using Python programming language. It should be noted that XGBoost is not a deep learning framework but rather a gradient boosting library designed for efficient use of system resources. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine whether a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the model.
