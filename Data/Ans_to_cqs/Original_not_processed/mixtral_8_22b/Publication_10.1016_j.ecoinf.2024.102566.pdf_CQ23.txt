Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning models or their development process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on this context. However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, performing cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by ensuring that it can perform well on unseen data.
