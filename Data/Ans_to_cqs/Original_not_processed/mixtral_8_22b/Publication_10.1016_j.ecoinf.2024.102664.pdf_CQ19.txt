Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

In this study, the structure of the CNN model includes an image input 
layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a maximum 
pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, two fully connected layers, and 
a regression output layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully 
connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1. The 
structure of the LSTM model includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM 
layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output 
layer (Fig. 2c). The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 
10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

2.3. Deep learning model development 

CNN possesses robust capabilities for image feature extraction and is 
recognized as an effective tool for addressing image recognition chal-
lenges (Ilesanmi and Ilesanmi, 2021; Lei et al., 2019). It has also found 
applicability in the domain of time series signal processing (Gautam and 
Singh, 2020; Li et al., 2021). The CNN network architecture comprises 
convolutional  and  pooling  layer,  which  are  the  two  principal  hidden 
layers responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN.

indicate that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperforms both standalone 
CNN  and  LSTM  model  (Fig.  4–7).  The  hybrid  model  combines  the 
strengths of CNN and LSTM networks, offers significant advantages over 
using either network alone.

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. The details about the structure of the CNN and LSTM models were provided, but there was no mention of the programming language or framework used to implement these models. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was utilized.
