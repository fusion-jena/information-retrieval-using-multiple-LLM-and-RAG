3.4. Deep learning 

3.4.1. SLSTM method 

An LSTM network is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn 
long-term dependencies in sequential data, and an SLSTM model is an 
extension of an LSTM model that can forecast seasonal time-series data 
(Ma  et  al.,  2015),(Graves  and  Graves,  2012).  Compared  with  LSTM 
models, SLSTM models include an additional input layer for processing 
seasonal time series, which is fed through a seasonal convolutional layer 
to  extract  relevant  seasonal  features.  An  SLSTM  unit  involves  the 
following steps:  

(1)  Seasonal decomposition is performed using Eq. (7), in which sx t 
represents the data after seasonal decomposition, χt  denotes the

Deep  learning  methods  are  being  widely  applied to  create  models 
directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). Deep 
learning methods have superior performance for time-series prediction 
than  do  many  other  models  (Li  et  al.,  2019b).  SLSTM  has  been  suc-
cessfully used to predict agricultural product sales (Yoo and Oh, 2020). 
To mitigate the high price volatility of agricultural products, sales vol-
ume can be forecasted before production for reducing production risks 
and  facilitating  agricultural  planning,  ultimately  minimizing  post-
production  price  fluctuations.  In  a  case  study,  an  SLSTM  model  was 
found  to  exhibit  lower  errors  and  considerably  higher  performance 
compared with the ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. In another case 
study, an SGRU model was used for successfully predicting the Pacific 
decadal  oscillation  index  at  multiple  time  scales  and  achieved  mean

5.1. Comparison of SLSTM and SGRU models 

Deep learning methods have accelerated the development of artifi-
cial intelligence and demonstrated potential in various domains (Chen 
et al., 2021). Deep learning architectures simulate neurons in the brain, 
and their ability to learn from complex data renders them the preferred 
choice for time-series prediction (Choi et al., 2021). RNNs are neural 
networks that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory 
to  enhance  their  time-series  prediction  performance  (Kavitha  et  al., 
2023).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the application of deep learning methods, specifically focusing on SLSTM and SGRU models, for time-series prediction tasks. These models are extensions of traditional LSTM networks and GRUs, respectively, designed to handle long-term dependencies and seasonality in sequential data. The context also mentions successful applications of these models in areas like agricultural product sales forecasting and predicting the Pacific decadal oscillation index.

Unhelpful Answer:
Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling are commonly used in image classification tasks within deep learning pipelines. They help improve the robustness and generalizability of trained models by creating new training samples from existing ones. For example, flipping images horizontally or vertically generates mirror images, while rotations and scalings alter the orientation and size of objects in the images. Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques related to time-series prediction tasks involving SLSTM and SGRU models.
