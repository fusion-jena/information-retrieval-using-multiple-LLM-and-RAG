Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

3. Results 

3.1. Results of classification and regression tasks

Performance of the CNN models were assessed using four different 
metrics (test loss, mean squared error - MSE, mean average percentage 
error – MAPE and accuracy - Acc). Accuracy of the regression tasks was 
calculated  by  rounding  the  prediction  to  the  nearest  integer  age  and 
comparing it with the ground truth. The labelling provided by human 
readers  are  treated  as  the  ground  truth,  and  accuracy  and  other  per-
formance metrics relates directly to this. 

The CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks 
during training are shown in Table 1. During training we use minibatch 
gradient descent.

%Query
Query: "How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It does not mention whether a method like grid search or random search was used. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
