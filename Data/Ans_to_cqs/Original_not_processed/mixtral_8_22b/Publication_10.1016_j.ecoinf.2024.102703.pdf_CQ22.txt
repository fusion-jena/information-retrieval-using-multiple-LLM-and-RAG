The BP neural network is among the most widely used neural net-
works. Due to its self-adaptability, self-organization, and fault tolerance, 
this  model  is  highly  effective  in  simulating  the  relationship  between 
spectral reflectance and water composition. It’s worth considering that 
aCDOM(254) still yielded a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.76) when predicting 
TSI, whereas Fn(355) still produced a higher R2 value (R2 = 0.71) when 
predicting TSI. We believe that the prediction results of the two models 
can be used as strong evidence for predicting TSI using DOM. This novel 
approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing 
DOM optical parameters, particularly the CDOM absorption coefficient, 
for  accurate  eutrophication  prediction.  It  was  also  mentioned  that 
aCDOM(254)  is  related  to  water  quality  parameters  such  as  DOC  and

Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

Helpful Answer:
To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Back Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network used in this case, two main metrics are employed: the Coefficient of Determination (R^2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help measure how well the predicted Trophic State Index (TSI) matches the actual or measured TSI.

The Coefficient of Determination (R^2), often referred to as the R-squared value, indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (in this case, TSI) explained by the independent variables (aCDOM(254) and Fn(355)). A high R^2 value suggests that the model has a good fit and explains much of the variability in the data.

On the other hand, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and observed values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance since they signify smaller differences between the predicted and actual TSI.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in this scenario is evaluated using the Coefficient of Determination (R^2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how accurately the model predicts the Trophic State Index based on the given inputs.
