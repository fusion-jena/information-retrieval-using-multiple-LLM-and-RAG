In Eq. (4), η(t) is the learning rate, which decreases with time t, and 

Sk(t) is the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t.

2.4.4. Clustering quality index (CQI) 

Owing to the characteristics of unsupervised clustering of SOM net-
works,  changing  the  number  of  categories  significantly  affects  the 
clustering results, and determining the number of categories is the key to

3. Results 

Spatial  clustering  of  the  AEGC  was  conducted  using  SOM.  The 
number of clustering categories was initially set to increase one by one 
from  two  to  ten,  and  then,  the  CQI  was  calculated.  Because  neural 
network clustering may have empty categories, the number of categories 
initially set and the number of categories in the clustering results are not 
necessarily identical. Clustering results of the same number of categories 
were selected for the smaller CQI values for screening, and eight pro-
grams were selected (Fig. 3).

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to correctly classify instances, minimize false positives or negatives, balance between precision and recall, and overall discriminating power.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use the Clustering Quality Index (CQI) to evaluate the performance of their Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network. This metric helps determine the optimal number of categories for clustering ecological data. However, without further details about how CQI is computed or what criteria it considers, we cannot compare it directly to other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
