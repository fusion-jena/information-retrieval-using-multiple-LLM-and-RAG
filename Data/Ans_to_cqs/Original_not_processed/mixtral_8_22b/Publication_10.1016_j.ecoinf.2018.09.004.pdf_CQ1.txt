In this paper, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques to ex-
amine the presence–absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean
Sea, and the environmental relationship among seagrasses at family
level. To achieve these, we combine data from a broad and diverse
range of databases, such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, aiming to
determine the most appropriate variables aﬀecting the distribution of
seagrasses. We used static and temporal variables and chose the most
important ones with variable importance method by the random forest
algorithm. The temporal variables have additional features such as the
values for each month, along with the year min, max and average for
surface and seabed, totaling 217 variables. In order to perform binary
classiﬁcation we propose a method to automatically generate an ab-
sence dataset based on the presence dataset. For both binary and multi-
class classiﬁcation, 7 diﬀerent classiﬁers are compared and their results
are discussed.

Helpful Answer:
The authors of the article use a combination of data from various databases, including EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, to collect raw data for their study. These databases provide access to different types of environmental data, such as bathymetry, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-α, nitrate, phosphate, Secchi disk depth, wave height, distance from nearest city, distance from nearest river mouth, distance from nearest port, distance to coast, and substrate. Some of these variables are static, while others are temporal, meaning they change over time. The temporal variables also include additional features such as values for each month, along with the yearly minimum, maximum, and average for surface and seabed. Overall, the authors utilize a wide range of publicly available datasets to gather the necessary information for their analysis.
