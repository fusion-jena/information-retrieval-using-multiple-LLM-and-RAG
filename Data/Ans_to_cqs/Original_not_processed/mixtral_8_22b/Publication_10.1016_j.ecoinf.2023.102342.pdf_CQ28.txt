• Mapping and interpretation of the results: It evaluates whether the 
objective has been achieved, and if the answer is no, it proceeds with 
the reiteration (and possible modification) of the previous step and 
sometimes further steps.  

• display of results in an understandable format;

2.2. Study area

In short, data mining ensures that starting from “cryptic” information 
scattered without apparent order in a database, we arrive at knowledge 
that can be exploited for various purposes (Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). 
It is also possible to implement (Online document, 2022b) an automatic 
elaboration  workflow  with  open-source  software  without  using  an 
operator who reprocesses the data each time. Data mining can be sup-
ported  by well-known  and  widely applied  data  processing techniques 
such as verifying or interpreting results (Hamdi et al., 2022).

o  Data  cleansing  and  pre-processing:  further  separation  between 
valid and invalid data, choice of how to treat the incomplete or 
empty fields, and a definitive selection of fundamental information 
for the ideal reference model.  

o  integration  between  analytical  data  with  acquisition  dates  and 

geographical coordinates;  

o  transformation  to  get  the  data  in  the  correct  format  to  be 

processed;

scans the data warehouse to provide the desired answer.  

• application  of  further  techniques  of  descriptive  and  inferential

%Query
Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not mention any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
