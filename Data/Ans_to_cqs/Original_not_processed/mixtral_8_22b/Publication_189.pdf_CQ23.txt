This  system  is  most  compatible  with  tensorflow  version 
1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. This model 
has been implemented on a machine with 1 GPU which uses 1 
Image per GPU and batch size for mrcnn training is  taken as a 
product of GPU and Images per GPU. The system used resnet 
50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes 
of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. The width and height of images 
in  this  research  is  fixed,  therefore  [a,640,640,3]  becomes  the 
image  shape  here  and  [a,640,640,1]  becomes  the  mask  shape 
where  a  is  the  number  of  training  images  and  true  masked 
images. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps 
each  are  being  used  for  training  images  and  100  steps  for 
validation images while evaluating the model. The learning rate, 
 used for heads layer training  has been  taken as 0.001 while 
during  all  layers  training    decayed  by  10.  For  weight

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some information can be inferred about the methods employed during the training process.

For instance, it was mentioned that the image shapes were fixed, indicating that the input data had consistent dimensions. Additionally, the model was trained using both ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones, suggesting that different architectures were explored to improve the robustness of the model. Furthermore, various anchor box ratios were utilized, implying that multiple scales were considered during object detection.

Moreover, the model underwent training for 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images. This indicates that the model was exposed to numerous iterations of the dataset, potentially enhancing its ability to learn complex patterns and improving its overall performance.

However, without further details regarding the nature of the dataset, the exact methodology used for training, and the evaluation metrics employed, it remains unclear whether these factors directly contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
