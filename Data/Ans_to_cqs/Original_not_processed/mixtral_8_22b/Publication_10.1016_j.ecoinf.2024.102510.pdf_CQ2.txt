To evaluate different CNN architectures, the dataset is randomly split 
into two sets: training and validation sets. The training set is  used to 
train the models, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's 
performance on unseen data. Then, the input images are resized to 224 
× 224 × 3 and 299 × 299 × 3 dimensions for both datasets as per the 
requirements.  In  this  study,  the  performance  evaluation  included  the 
application  of  in-place  image  augmentation.  The  models  underwent 
training for a total of 30 epochs, utilizing categorical cross-entropy as 
the chosen loss function. Notably, as part of the experimental setup, the 
original classifier was substituted with a customized classifier, allowing 
for specific modifications and adjustments tailored to the objectives of 
the study. This customization aimed to enhance the performance of the 
models and optimize their ability to accurately classify bird species.

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. There are multiple mentions of datasets containing thousands of images of various bird species. For instance, there is mention of a dataset consisting of 83 bird species native to Indonesia, which includes 8057 images. Additionally, another dataset contains 31,320 images of 29 bird species. Furthermore, the process involves resizing these images to fit the requirements of the models being trained. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the main data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is images.
