Helpful Answer: The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the description of their architectures and components such as convolutional layers, global average pooling, and skip/shortcut connections, it can be inferred that these are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) designed primarily for image-related tasks. These tasks could include image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation.

The mention of 'label smoothing' in InceptionV3 suggests that this particular model might be used for multi-class image classification tasks. Label smoothing is a regularization technique often used in such scenarios to prevent overconfident predictions.

Moreover, the use of 'bottleneck architecture', 'dimension reduction', and 'dimension restoration' in one of the described models indicates that it might be employed for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction purposes, which are common steps in various machine learning pipelines.

However, without explicit information about the specific task each model was trained for, we cannot definitively state the purpose of these deep learning models beyond them being CNNs likely used for image-related tasks.
