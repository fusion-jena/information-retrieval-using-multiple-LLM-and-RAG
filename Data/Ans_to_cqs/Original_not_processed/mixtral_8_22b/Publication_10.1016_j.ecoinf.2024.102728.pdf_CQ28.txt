There were two main data sources assembled within a database and
used for the fieldwork/analysis: (1) archaeological survey data from the
Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) (Dagan, 2006) for LTA-LU; and (2)
remotely sensed data (spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-
toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENμS), airborne Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for LC. Addi-
tional ancillary data was required for establishing research control,
georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas, including (1) digital maps
from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC (M.O.
A., 2023); (2) georegistered orthophotos (12.5 cm) from the Survey of
Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area (S.O.I.,
2018); (3) substrate data for geology, from the Israel geological survey
(I.G.S., 2010, 2016), and soil (Ravikovitch, 1969); (4) climate-related
data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S., 2023) and the US

The geology layer is based on the 1:50000 scale Bet Guvrin (I.G.S.,
2016) and Qiryat Gat sheets (I.G.S., 2010) that were georeferenced,
concatenated, and digitized in QGIS (2023) and TerrSet (2017) GIS
software. The soil layer was digitized from a georeferenced 1:250000

Query: "Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific cloud platform or local computing environment was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined with certainty which platform was utilized for this purpose.
