Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, various strategies can be employed. One common strategy is fixing the random seed value, which ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of numbers when running experiments multiple times. Another strategy is using cross-validation or bootstrapping methods to evaluate models on different subsets of data, reducing the impact of any single random initialization. Additionally, ensembling techniques such as bagging or boosting can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of data. Finally, hyperparameter tuning through grid search or Bayesian optimization can further improve model performance and reduce variability due to random initializations.
