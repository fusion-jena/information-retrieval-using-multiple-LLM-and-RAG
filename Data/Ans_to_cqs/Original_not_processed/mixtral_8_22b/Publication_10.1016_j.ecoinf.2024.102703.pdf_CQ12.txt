Build a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network 
using MATLAB R2014b (Lin et al., 2021). The first layer (i.e. the input 
layer) corresponded to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) respectively. The 
intermediate layer (i.e. hidden layers) and the last layer (i.e. the output 
layer)  comprised  a  single  neuron,  that  corresponded  to  the  predictor 
(TSI). Set the maximum training times to 10,000 and the training error 
to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration, with the 
remaining  used  for  validation.  Validation  accuracy  was  assessed  by 
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square 
error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. The RMSE was 
determined using Eq. (6).

where Mea,TSI is the measured TSI and Pre.TSI is the TSI predicted using 
the neural network model. 

3. Results

Due  to  the  increased  complexity  of  the  interactions  between  vari-
ables,  the  selection  of  important  variables  becomes  challenging.  The 
LASSO model was used for variable selection and statistical regulariza-
tion to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model (Mukherjee et al., 
2019). This model states that the impact of nutrient and environmental 
factors on FDOM varies with trophic state. Previous research conducted 
on the Inner Mongolia Plateau has validated the strong positive corre-
lations between the optical properties of DOM and the TSI, suggesting 
that  DOM  is  influenced  by  nutrient  variation  (Wen  et  al.,  2016). 
Regardless of the trophic state, pH consistently correlates with FDOM, 
with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions. Prior 
research indicated that pH significantly influences DOM photolysis rates 
and absorbance (Timko et al., 2015). pH is also the environmental driver

pollution, and hydrology impact the quantity and quality of DOM, which 
could influence the accuracy of the model prediction. Hence, additional 
data from diverse lakes and rivers is necessary to enhance the models’ 
applicability and accuracy.

Helpful Answer:
The study uses a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network built using MATLAB R2014b. The first layer corresponds to the inputs aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), while the intermediate and final layers consist of a single neuron each, representing the predictor (TSI). The LASSO model is employed for variable selection and statistical regularization to improve the model's prediction accuracy. However, it should be noted that this approach does not fall into the categories of popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers. Instead, it utilizes a more traditional feedforward neural network architecture.
