to how a bee swarm searches for, advertises and ultimately chooses the 
best-known  food  source.  Several  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the 
ABC-ANFIS  model  has  robust  advantages  that  traditional  methods  do 
not  possess,  including  its  flexible  learning  capability,  comprehensive 
and  integrated  nature,  and  ability  to  handle  uncertain  or  fuzzy  input 
data, thus yielding predictions with high levels of reliability (Al-Qaness 
et al., 2020; Do et al., 2022).

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance caused by random sampling, and using ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained on different subsets of data.
