feature representations, which are crucial for predicting the threshold of 
image  processing  algorithms  (Wang  et  al.,  2018).  In  this  study,  we 
propose a compact network incorporating a non-local layer capable of 
extracting  long-distance  features  to  predict  parameters  for  the  image 
processing module. Additionally, we introduce a joint training approach 
for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models to 
ensure  that  the  image  processing  results  contribute  to  improved  per-
formance  of  the  deep  learning  model.  The  proposed  method  demon-
strates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. it 
enables  expedited  transitions  from  field  surveys  to  reporting,  even  in 
challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection 
and analysis on a larger scale.

The term “deep learning” refers to the utilization of neural networks, 
a statistical model for data representation in solving complex problems 
(LeCun  et  al.,  2015;  Christopher  and  Hugh,  2024).  These  neural  net-
works are constructed through training, involving a large set of inputs 
and  labeled outputs. Comprising layered nonlinear transformations, a 
neural  network  contains  numerous  adjustable  parameters.  Training  a 
neural network requires multiple iterations, during which the network 
may produce incorrect results. The discrepancy between the current and 
expected outputs is calculated as loss values. Optimization algorithms 
such as Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Herbert and Sutton, 1951), 
Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) (Duchi et al., 2011), Root Mean Square 
Prop (RMSProp) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), and Adam (Kingma and 
Ba, 2014) are then employed to assess each parameter’s contribution to

Deep  learning,  on  the  other  hand,  replaces  manual  filters  with 
feature extractors trained on extensive datasets, mitigating the influence 
of external noise. Leveraging this advantage, deep learning has achieved 
remarkable  advancements  in  various  domains,  including  machine 
translation  (Vaswani  et  al.,  2017),  speech  recognition  (Dong  et  al., 
2018),  and  computer  vision  (He  et  al.,  2016).  Deep  Convolutional 
Neural  Networks  (DCNN)  represent  a  classic  deep  learning  model 
extensively  utilized  for  image  processing  (Krizhevsky  et  al.,  2017). 
Extensive research has demonstrated that DCNN can effectively extract 
ecological information from camera trap images, including species la-
bels, counts, and behaviors (Borowiec et al., 2022; Frank and Volker, 
2021; Manuel et al., 2021). While deep learning has proven successful in 
extracting  information  from  camera  trap  images,  the  inherent

Camera traps are widely utilized as a popular, non-invasive, and cost- 
effective method for gathering observational data on wildlife. However, 
it is inevitable that low-quality images are captured by these cameras in 
the intricate and unpredictable environments of the wild. In the domains 
of agriculture and fisheries, recent research has predominantly focused 
on  enhancing  the  performance  of  deep  learning  approaches  for  low- 
quality  images  through  the  incorporation  of  attention  mechanisms 
(Enlin et al., 2023; Xianchong et al., 2023; Zan et al., 2022). However, 
most of these studies have relied on manually collected images, which 
inherently  exhibit  environmental  selectivity.  In  contrast,  camera  trap 
images are passively captured in any environment where wild animals 
may appear. Consequently, camera trap images face a more complex and 
challenging  environment,  which  can  obscure  crucial  features  of  the

Helpful Answer:
In the context of deep learning, raw data can be collected using various methods depending on the specific application or domain. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: Data can be gathered through structured or unstructured surveys, such as online forms, interviews, or questionnaires. This method is often used when human input is required, like sentiment analysis or opinion mining tasks.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can collect raw data, such as temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS devices, and cameras. For example, sensor data can be used in applications like object detection, autonomous driving, or health monitoring systems.

3. Public Datasets: Pre-existing datasets available publicly can also serve as sources of raw data. These datasets may contain text, images, audio files, videos, or other types of data relevant to specific tasks. Examples include ImageNet for image classification, MNIST for digit recognition, and CIFAR-10 for general object recognition.

In the given context, one of the primary sources of raw data mentioned is camera traps. Camera traps are a type of passive sensor used for capturing images of wildlife in their natural habitats without causing disturbance. They are commonly deployed in ecology and conservation studies to monitor animal populations, behavior, and distribution patterns.

However, due to the uncontrolled nature of the environments in which they operate, camera traps often capture low-quality images that pose challenges for deep learning models. To address this issue, researchers have been focusing on improving the performance of deep learning techniques for handling low-quality images, primarily through the use of attention mechanisms.

Overall, the choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand. A combination of different methods might sometimes be necessary to gather comprehensive and representative raw data for deep learning applications.
