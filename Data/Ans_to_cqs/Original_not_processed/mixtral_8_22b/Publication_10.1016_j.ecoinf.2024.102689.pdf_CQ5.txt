As deep learning continues to flourish, a myriad of researchers has 
pivoted  their  focus  towards  animal  individual  recognition,  aiming  to 
gain  deeper  insights  into  animal  behavior,  growth  status,  and  more. 
However,  the  pursuit  of  animal  individual  recognition  necessitates  a 
substantial  dataset  of  animal  images,  and  acquiring  such  datasets  is 
often challenging. To overcome the hurdle of dataset collection, Ferreira 
et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously gathers training 
data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for their study on small bird individual recognition. This 
approach  alleviates  the  need  for  manual  annotation  and  independent 
neural network training.

Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, it does highlight some unique datasets created by various research teams for their studies. For instance, Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously collects training data and generates training datasets for their work on small bird individual recognition. Another example is the creation of the Arcface_Mask dataset mentioned but without further details about its content. Additionally, there is a reference to a high-resolution monitoring system for fish length and catch numbers using deep learning, which likely involves a custom dataset tailored to this application. Therefore, while no well-known standard datasets were directly referenced, these examples demonstrate how researchers often create specialized datasets to meet the requirements of their specific projects.
