Building  the  convolutional  neural  network.  Convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  belong  to  the 
class  of  DLAs.  For  the  case  of  species  identification,  the  training  phase  is  supervised,  which  means  that  the 
classes  to  identify  are  pre-defined  by  human  experts  while  the  parameters  of  the  classifier  are  automatically 
optimized  in  order  to  accurately  classify  a  “training”   database24.  CNNs  are  composed  of  neurons,  which  are 
organized in layers. Each neuron of a layer computes an operation on the input data and transfers the extracted 
information to the neurons of the next layer. The specificity of CNNs is to build a descriptor for the input image 
data and the classifier at the same time, ensuring they are both optimized for each  other42. The neurons extract-
ing the characteristics from the input data in order to build the descriptors are called convolutional neurons, as

training datasets.

•  In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a CNN on a given database T0 (Fig. 2a)
•  Then, the second phase consists of tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e. each species in our 

case), noted i, with i ∈ {1, ..., n} , using a second and independent database noted T1 (Fig. 2b).

In terms of classification, it means we transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) in 3 options 

(Fig. 3) by applying Eqs. (15, 16).

Computing the confidence thresholds.  After the phase 1 (model training phase), for an image X of the 
threshold tuning dataset processed by the classifier, we obtain an output {C(X), S(X)} , where C(X) is the class 
(i.e. species, belonging to the trained set of species) with the highest classification score S(X). For this image, we 
know the ground truth Y in {1, .., n} belonging to the same set of species classes.

Helpful Answer:
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that belongs to the class of Deep Learning Algorithms (DLAs). They are specifically designed to process grid-like topology data such as images. In the case of species identification, the training phase is supervised, meaning that the classes to be identified are pre-defined by human experts while the parameters of the classifier are automatically optimized to accurately classify a 'training' database. CNNs consist of neurons organized in layers, with each neuron computing an operation on the input data and transferring the extracted information to the neurons of the next layer. The specificity of CNNs is their ability to build a descriptor for the input image data and the classifier simultaneously, ensuring they are both optimized for each other.
