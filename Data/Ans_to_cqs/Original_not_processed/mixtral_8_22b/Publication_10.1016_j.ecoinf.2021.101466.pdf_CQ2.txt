To train the EfficientNet, we prepared 4000 images for each category 
using the data augmentation method proposed above. We used 80% of 
the 4000 images for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The 
EfficientNet was trained by the Adagrad in 100 epochs. The dropout rate 
for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. 

All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti 
GPU with 11G memory, and the software was Windows 10, Python 3.7, 
CUDA 10.2. Keras 2.4.3 were used to build all models. 

To compare model results with the test video, we used IoU as the 
threshold  for  positives  or  negatives  based  on  the  object  confidence 
scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the inter-
section  over  the  union  of  the  two  bounding  boxes,  which  were  the 
ground-truth  bounding  box  and  the  predicted  bounding  box.  In  this 
paper, we set the threshold of IoU at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect 
detection results.

Second, we proposed data augmentation to train the EfficientNet as a 
classifier. The basic concept of this procedure was the same as that in the 
data  extension  for  YOLO,  where  we  combined  a  masked  foreground 
image  with  a  background  image  that  did  not  contain  any  insects.  At 
most,  one  foreground  image  was  composited.  For  the  foreground, 
background, and combined images, the same image processing as the 
data augmentation for YOLOv4 was applied. For the data augmentation 
employed  to  train  the  EfficientNet,  the  parameters  are  shown  in 
Table 1b. Fig. 4 shows an example of data augmentation for the second 
stage of the proposed augmentation method.

In the emerging area of deep learning, effective and efficient CNN-

The  past  development  of  CNN  was  synonymous  to  the  increased 
depth of the network. By increasing the depth and widening the channel 
size, a more complex network achieved a high resolution of the image 
data. In addition, it resulted in more fine-grained characteristics. This 
development in the network size improved the classification accuracy of 
the network, but also led to the problem of the high computational cost 
of the gradient explosion parameter. ResNet (He et al., 2015) proposed 
that skip connection could avoid gradient explosion skillfully. Mobile-
Net (Howard et al., 2017) used pointwise and depthwise convolutions to 
reduce network parameters and improve training efficiency. The SENet 
(Hu et al., 2017) weighted various features by loss of network training in 
order to achieve better results in model training.

capacity  over  various  benchmark  datasets  by  adopting  a  compound 
scaling method that enlarges the network depth, width, and resolution. 
In  addition,  we  proposed  a  data  augmentation  method  to  train  the 
two-stage CNNs as a generally applicable model under various camera or 
field conditions.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given information, the study primarily focuses on using images for training the EfficientNet model. Specifically, they use 4000 images per category, applying data augmentation techniques such as combining masked foreground images with background images without insects. They mention preparing these images for both training and validation purposes. Therefore, the primary data format used in their deep learning pipeline is images. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files being utilized in their work.
