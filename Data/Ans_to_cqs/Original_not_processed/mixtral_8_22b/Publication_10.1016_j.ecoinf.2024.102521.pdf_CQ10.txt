A major aspect of any data driven project is data availability. Data- 
science thrives on data, and ecoinformatics is no exception. STARdbi’s 
vision of large-scale surveys of species and biodiversity assessment re-
quires that its raw and processed data be available to the entomological 
community and the general public. Typically, however, the generators 
of  data wish  to exhaust  the  publication  potential of  their data before 
making it publicly available. Further, governments, the major sponsors 
of most research, may restrict data sharing to protect political interests.

Insects  are  highly  abundant  and  diverse,  and  play  major  roles  in  ecosystem  functions.  Monitoring  of  insect 
populations is key to their sustainable management. However, the labor and expertise needed to identify insects, 
and the challenges of archiving the wealth of data collected in monitoring programs, often limit these efforts. We 
describe a pipeline to reduce the barriers associated with curating and mining big data of insect biodiversity. The 
pipeline, STARdbi, includes capturing flying insects with sticky traps, scanning the traps, storing the trap-images 
in a public database with a web-based interface, and applying machine learning models to extract information 
from the images. To illustrate the insights that can be gained from STARdbi, we describe two case studies. One of 
them involves monitoring of circadian activity patterns of grain pests and of their natural enemies, and the other
