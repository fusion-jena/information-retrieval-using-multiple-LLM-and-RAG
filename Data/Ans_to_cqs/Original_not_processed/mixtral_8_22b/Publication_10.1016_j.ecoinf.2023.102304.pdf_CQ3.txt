%Query
Query: "What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?"

Provide your answer as follows:

Answer:::
Answer: (provide your answer to query in less than 400 words)

Answer:::

Helpful Answer:
The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were employed based solely on this context.
