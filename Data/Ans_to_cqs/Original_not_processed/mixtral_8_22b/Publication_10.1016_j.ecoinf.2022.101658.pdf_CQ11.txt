comparisons with field data or the deep convolutional neural network 
model  training.  Correlations  between  the  automatically  segmented 
photos and field measured data from the CK field site were undertaken 
with  the  same  methods  described  previously  for  the  manually 
segmented photos collected at the PM and CL field sites. 

3. Results

our study, is due to the deep learning methodâ€™s loss function, which is 
biased toward overrepresented classes. This represents a performance 
barrier for any study using semantic segmentation with few images and 
high class-imbalance.

The goal of semantic segmentation is to automatically assign one of 
the ten previously described cover types to each pixel of the nadir image. 
This  is  a  complex  task  since  many  vegetation  types  have  only  subtle 
differences  in  appearance,  and  exhibit  irregular  shapes  and  sizes.  We 
used the framework of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) in 
our work as it has been found to work well for semantic segmentation 
purposes;  however,  this  framework  is  notorious  for  requiring  a  large 
number  of  labeled  images  for  the  training  process,  which  we  lacked. 
Therefore,  we  opted  to  use  Transfer  Learning  when  dealing  with  our 
limited dataset. Transfer learning involves transferring knowledge ac-
quired by training a model in one particular task to another, related task. 
In  our  case,  we  used  the  pre-trained  Deeplabv3-ResNet101  model 
(Chen et al., 2017) as our base network for deriving knowledge to solve
