Ways  in  which  to  minimize  biased  training  of  machine  learning 
models  with  clustered  data  is  an  outstanding  challenge  (e.g.,  Meyer 
et al., 2018, 2019). We hypothesize that the improvements to predictive 
performance observed here using covariance-weighted bagging may be 
a  result  of  reduced  bias  during  model  training  from  down-weighting 
over-sampled  information,  but  this  was  not  tested  explicitly.  A  suit-
able experiment to explore this topic could simulate a surface from a pre- 
defined combination of response functions to environmental variables, 
and  test  for  the  capacity  to  recover  the  responses  using  covariance 
weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios. Simultaneously, it 
would be informative to observe the automatic variable selection and 
regularization behaviour of the bagging model. 

5. Conclusions

To assess the capacity for unbiased validation using the covariance- 
weighted  bagging  approach,  results  were  benchmarked  against  five 
other methods. 

2.5.1. Out-of-bag validation 

The accuracy of the model was evaluated at the simulated locations 
using  an  out-of-bag  validation.  Out-of-bag  predictions  for  each  simu-
lated data point are obtained during the bagging process by predicting 
the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap 
sample,  and averaging the  results of  these predicted values across  all

useful for evaluating extrapolation capacity (Roberts et al., 2017). For 
cases where the model is only required to predict within the space and 
time  of  the  sample  domain,  these  approaches  are  typically  overly 
aggressive at penalizing the predictive capacity of the model. Further-
more, while spatial partitioning may be straightforward to implement 
for consistent clustering, it becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient 
in  cases  of  inconsistent,  non-uniform,  or  partial  clustering.  Given  the 
large  number  of  spatial  cross-validation  approaches  designed  to  deal 
with biased model validation caused by clustered sampling (e.g., Bren-
ning, 2012; Roberts et al., 2017; Valavi et al., 2019), it is surprising that 
spatial  weighting  approaches  are  comparatively  under-developed  for 
this purpose.

Helpful Answer:
Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does discuss some techniques used to evaluate and improve the performance of a machine learning model, specifically a covariance-weighted bagging approach.

One method mentioned for evaluating the model's performance is out-of-bag validation. This technique involves obtaining out-of-bag predictions for each simulated data point during the bagging process by predicting the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample. These predicted values are then averaged across all samples to provide an overall measure of the model's accuracy.

Additionally, the context mentions comparing the results of the covariance-weighted bagging approach to other methods, including random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector regression, and linear models. Benchmarking the performance of the proposed method against multiple alternative methods can help demonstrate its robustness and applicability across different types of data and modeling tasks.

While these evaluation strategies do contribute to understanding the model's performance and potential biases, they do not directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model through diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
